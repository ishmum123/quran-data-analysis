Maulana Muhammad Ali's English translation of the Quran was the 
first English translation by a Muslim to be available generally, and 
the first Muslim translation published in the West, in 1917. 

It included a comprehensive commentary: discussing meanings of 
Arabic words, reviewing earlier interpretations, citing authorities 
wherever he differed with previous views, removing misconceptions 
about Islam and refuting objections raised by Western criticism. 

Later Muslim translators, such as Pickthall, Yusuf Ali, and 
Muhammad Asad, benefitted greatly from this pioneering work. 
"Pickthall's work is not very much more than a revision of the 
Ahmadiyya [M. Ali] version" — The Muslim World, July 1931 .

to deny the light of the sun.'

standard." — Madras Mail, 1 929. 



"[I] greatly admire the general arrangement. As for the English 
rendering, 1 am impressed ... with the simplicity and precision and 
the adherence to the text which indicate the reverence due to God's 
own Word from a true believer." — Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Indian 
Muslim nationalist leader, 1918. 

"Probably no man living has done longer or more valuable service 
for the cause of Islamic revival than Maulana Muhammad Ali of 
Lahore." — Marmaduke Pickthall, 1936, reviewing a later work by 
Maulana Muhammad Ali. 



In the present, revised (2010) edition, the Arabic text has not been 
included. The language of the translation has been updated where 
necessary, and the notes have been abridged and edited.

Preface 

The English translation of the Holy Quran with extensive explana- 
tory footnotes, by Maulana Muhammad Ali (d. 1951), was first 
published in 1917. It was the first English translation and 
commentary by a Muslim to be generally available in the world. 
The 1917 and several subsequent editions were printed in England 
and distributed from the Muslim mission at the Woking Mosque 
in England. This work remained the only Muslim English transla- 
tion for several years. It was widely acclaimed as being an accurate, 
faithful, and true rendering, one which was desperately needed. It 
influenced all the major later English translations. 

Maulana Muhammad Ali's translation was not merely an aca- 
demic or literary exercise. It was done to refute the vast mass of 
misrepresentations of Islam by its Western critics, to convey the 
faith-reviving and heart-inspiring light of Islam to the world, to 
show how Islamic teachings are applicable to solving the prob- 
lems of modern times, and to teach and guide both the Western- 
educated Muslims and English-speaking new Muslim converts. 
Towards the end of his life, Maulana Muhammad Ali thoroughly 
revised his translation and commentary, the revised edition being 
published in 1951. The translation was made simpler and the 
commentary was brought up to date with the changed circum- 
stances prevailing after the Second World War. 

The language of the translation was solemn and dignified, as 
befits a Divine scripture, yet it was also plain and easy to under- 
stand, aimed at the level of an educated reader having a reasonable 
standard of English. However, due to changes in the usage and

the early 1900s but these were of very limited circulation, and little known.

teaching of English in the second half of the twentieth century, 
such a reader today is much less familiar with certain forms and 
styles of literary expression used in the translation than was the 
case with previous generations. To bring the language closer to the 
general readership, it became necessary to replace some expressions 
by more modern forms. This has been my aim in producing the 
present updated version of the translation, while showing reverence 
to the original work and remaining as close as possible to the lan- 
guage used by Maulana Muhammad Ali. 

The factor of greatest assistance during this editing work has 
been that the Maulana has himself in some places used more 
modern terms and in other places older styles to translate the same 
original words. Utilising this, I have been able to select his own 
phraseology to replace the older expressions. Thus, in the work of 
updating the translation in various places, I have applied the word- 
ing used by him elsewhere if such could be suitably found. 

The most noticeable change is the replacement of the second 
person singular forms, 'thou', 'thee', 'thy', etc. by 'you' and 'your'. 
In fact, in the Preface to his first edition published in 1917, the 
Maulana wrote: "I have, however, given up the antiquated thou 
(except when the Divine Being is addressed)". In that edition he 
added a marginal column on the left of the translation, in which he 
indicated whether 'you' in the line of text opposite was the singu- 
lar 'thou'. In his revised 1951 edition, he removed this margin as 
unnecessary and used the 'thou' forms within the translation itself. 
I have reverted to the usage of the 1917 edition, but have employed 
the convention that whenever 'you' is in the singular the letter y is 
printed in italics as in: you, jour. When God is addressed, which is 
always in the singular in the Quran, I have also used "You", with 
capital "Y", instead of "Thou" and "Thee". 

The next most prominent change is also a reversion to the first 
edition, and that is in the use of the negative. In the revised 1951 
edition the Maulana has used constructions such as "you know not", 
"they see not", etc. I have restored the style of his 1917 edition in 
which these are of the form: "you do not know", "they do not 
see", etc. 



PREFACE 1-3 



I will illustrate other changes by giving examples. The Maulana 
has used the words aught and naught in many places in the trans- 
lation, but in other places exactly the same Arabic text has been 
translated using anything, nothing, in the least and at all. The 
particle bal is usually translated by him as nay, but in some places 
it is translated as rather, but or yet. In some places the more tra- 
ditional that which (as in that which Allah has revealed) has been 
used by him but in others the simpler what (as in what Allah has 
revealed). The word translated as iniquitous is often also rendered 
as unjust or wrongdoer, the word translated as tarry is sometimes 
remain or stay, and hosts is sometimes forces or army. In each of 
these and similar cases I have used the latter words, which are more 
common, to replace the former, less familiar ones. 

The Arabic preposition min is often used to indicate that a 
person belongs to a certain group, as for example in the transla- 
tion: "if he is of (min) the truthful" (12:27, 12:51), "he is of (min) 
the liars" (12:26) or "if thou art of (min) the truthful" (26:31). The 
same kind of expression is elsewhere translated more simply as in 
the examples: "if thou art truthful" (26:154, 26:187), "I think him 
a liar" (28:38). I have substituted the latter style for the former, 
except if the change would not suit the context. Another type of 
similar instance is as in constructions such as "of them is he (min- 
hum man) who believes . . . and of them is he who turns away" 
(4:55). Elsewhere the construction used is: "some of them 
believed and some of them denied" (2:253). Again, I have replaced 
the former by the latter. 

I have also tried, as far as possible, to make the translation of 
the same phrase consistent in all its occurrences by using one of 
the wordings employed for it by the Maulana, if he had used 
different wording in different places. However, in certain places 
this has not been done because there was a clear reason for the 
difference, such as better suiting the context. 

In some of those cases in which it was necessary to revise a 
word or phrase, I could not find a suitable alternative used else- 
where by the Maulana. In those instances, I have used my own 
judgment to make the revision while restricting myself to the 
Maulana' s style and language as far as possible. 



1-4 PREFACE 



In a Preface I cannot list and explain every type of revision. 
Anyone interested in knowing the reason for any particular 
changes that are not explained here should contact me. 

In clarification of certain points, I have consulted not only the 
1917 edition of the Maulana's English translation but also his Urdu 
translation with extensive commentary known as Bayan-ul-Quran. 
I would also mention that in case of some verses I have compared 
other English translations of the Quran, old and new, to form a 
judgment as to the most suitable level of language. 

It is clear that Maulana Muhammad Ali produced his trans- 
lation to the highest standard of literary scholarship and he used 
words, expressions, phrases and styles that reflect the original Arabic 
with great precision, perhaps unmatched by any other English 
translation. In my effort to update its language, and bring it closer 
to current usage, it was inevitable that in some places its high 
literary level would be reduced and the new expressions employed 
be somewhat less precise than those which they replace. 

Maulana Muhammad Ali had also produced two editions of 
his translation without including the Arabic text and with much 
condensed footnotes, in order to make available a handier book for 
the general reader. 1 Following the same approach in the present 
work, the Arabic text has not been included, and the footnote 
content has been abridged although not nearly by the extent of 
reduction in the Maulana's two editions. Taking the footnotes from 
his revised 1951 edition (as also found in its subsequent reprints), 
I have eliminated the detailed lexical discussion of the range of 
meaning of words and the explanation of the variety of views 
about the interpretation of the text. Only the conclusion reached 
by the Maulana as to the explanation of the verses is retained. 
Occasionally the abridgment has required some insignificant re- 
phrasing of his original words. 

Those who wish to benefit from the Maulana's full, scholarly 
commentary are referred to the reprints of his 1951 edition. 



1. The first such edition was published in 1928, which was reprinted in 1951. A 
revised version of the same work was published in 1948. 



PREFACE 1-5 



At certain points in the footnotes it was necessary to make 
some further comment on a text, due mainly to issues and ques- 
tions that have arisen in recent years. To meet this need I have 
added my own comments, marked as Editor's Note. These occur 
within existing footnotes and also as additional footnotes. In three 
places (21:85, 33:72, 55:33), footnotes have been added based on 
suggestions made by the late Mr N.A. Faruqui, a leading figure of 
the Ahmadiyya Anjuman Lahore who was much involved in the 
Quran translation and publication work of this movement. He had 
sent me a brief draft of that material. 

The introductory notes at the head of the chapters have had to 
be abridged considerably and therefore they have been re -worded. 

As in the two editions produced by the Maulana which do not 
include the Arabic text, I have laid out the translation in continuous 
running form, not starting each verse on a new line. However, for 
ease of reading as well as comprehension I have divided most sec- 
tions further into paragraphs. Note that the division of the longer 
chapters of the Quran into sections is only found in certain parts of 
the Muslim world, such as the Indian subcontinent. The headings 
given to sections is a feature of our English translations; these are 
not in the Arabic text of the Quran. 

This edition carries an Introduction consisting of a life of the 
Holy Prophet Muhammad and some information about the Quran, 
its teachings, and the history of its compilation, all taken from 
writings of Maulana Muhammad Ali as indicated there. 

I cannot bring this Preface to a close without a mention of my 
association with the publication which I have edited to produce 
the present work. It was in 1978 that I first carried out a detailed, 
close reading of the latest reprint of the 1951 edition of the 
English translation and commentary of the Holy Quran by 
Maulana Muhammad Ali in order to identify typographical errors 
and inconsistencies in preparation for the next reprint. The list of 
corrections and other suggestions that I thus compiled was gone 
through in detail in Lahore by Mr N.A. Faruqui and Mr Muhammad 
Ahmad, son of Maulana Muhammad Ali. In 1981 Mr Faruqui 
referred to this in his obituary of Muhammad Ahmad as follows: 



1-6 PREFACE 



"Muhammad Ahmad's work in the revision of the seventh 
edition of the English translation and commentary of the Holy 
Quran, now under print, was equally painstaking. For that 
revision, the original spadework done by Dr. Zahid Aziz was 
the most thorough job I have ever seen. But to collate and 
give final shape to the suggestions made by Dr. Zahid Aziz 
and several others, Muhammad Ahmad spent long evenings 
with me after his office hours." ' 

In 1990 it was proposed to re-typeset the entire work. I made 
detailed suggestions for a new, improved design and layout which 
were carefully scrutinised by the Head of the Ahmadiyya Anjuman 
Lahore, Dr Saeed Ahmad Khan, the Vice-President Mr N.A. Faruqui, 
and other senior members of the Anjuman. The new edition incor- 
porating these suggestions was published in the USA in 2002. 
I was in charge of the proof reading of the newly composed text. 
The index in that edition was also enlarged by me by about 50% 
from the previous one by Maulana Muhammad AH. This back- 
ground has been indicated in the Foreword by Dr Saeed Ahmad 
Khan and Mr Faruqui, and in the Publisher's Note written by me, 
in that edition. 2 

I have outlined this history to show that my previous experience 
equipped me somewhat, and inspired me, to carry out the present 
revision. 

I wish to express my thanks to Mr Shaukat Ali, Coordinator 
of the Ahmadiyya Anjuman Lahore for the Asia and Pacific 
Region, for pointing out some typographical errors.

Introduction 

1. Life of the Prophet Muhammad* 

Before prophethood 

It was in the year 571 C.E. that the Prophet Muhammad was born. 
He came of the noblest family of Arabia, the Quraish, who were 
held in the highest esteem, being guardians of the Sacred House at 
Makkah, the Ka'bah, the spiritual centre of the whole of Arabia. 
At the time of his birth Arabia was steeped deep in the worst form 
of idolatry that has ever prevailed in any country. The Ka'bah 
itself was full of idols, and every household had, in addition, its 
own idols. Unhewn stones, trees and heaps of sand were also 
worshipped. In spite of this vast and deep-rooted idolatry, the 
Arabs were materialistic, "eat and drink" being the tone of most of 
their poetry. There was practically no faith in the life after death, 
no feeling of responsibility for one's actions. The Arabs, however, 
believed in demons, and diseases were attributed to the influence 
of evil spirits. 

Ignorance prevailed among the high as well as the low, so 
much so that the noblest of men could boast of his ignorance. 
There was no moral code, and vice was rampant. Sexual relations 
were loose, obscene poems and songs were recited in public 
assemblies. There was no punishment for, nor any moral sanction 
against, illicit sexual relations. Prostitution had nothing dis- 
honourable about it, so that leading men could keep brothels. 
Women were in the most degraded position, looked upon as a 
mere chattel. Instead of having any right to inheritance of property,

tions from Muhammad The Prophet, both by Maulana Muhammad Ali.

a woman herself formed part of the inheritance, and the heir could 
dispose of her as he liked. There was no settled government, no 
law in the land, and might was practically right. 

The Arabs belonged to one race and spoke one language, yet 
they were the most disunited people. Tribe made war on tribe, and 
family on family, on the most trivial excuse. The strong among them 
trampled upon the rights of the weak, and the weak could not get 
their wrongs redressed. The widow and the orphan were quite help- 
less and slaves were treated most cruelly. 

Among this people was born the Prophet Muhammad. His 
father Abdullah had died before his birth and he lost even his 
mother Aminah when he was six years old. On the death of his 
mother, the charge of the child fell to his paternal grandfather, 
Abdul Muttalib. Barely two years had elapsed, however, when 
Abdul Muttalib also died. Thus he was eight years old when his 
guardianship passed to his paternal uncle, Abu Talib. 

He came of the noblest family of the Quraish, yet, like most 
of the rest of his countrymen, he was not taught reading and 
writing. He tended sheep for some time, but in his youth he was 
chiefly occupied in trade. It was, however, his high morals that 
distinguished him from the first from all his compatriots. The 
Holy Quran, which contains the most trustworthy account of the 
Prophet's life, says that he was the possessor of "sublime morals" 
(68:4). 

Leading generally a reserved life, he had for friends only those 
men whose moral greatness was admitted by all. His truthfulness 
is testified in the clearest words (6:33). His bitterest opponents 
were challenged to point out a single black spot on his character 
during the forty years that he had passed among them before he 
received the Divine call (10:16). It was in his youth that, on 
account of his pure and unsoiled character and his love for truth 
and honesty, he won from his compatriots the title of al-Amin, or 
the Faithful. 

Living in a country in which idol-worship was the basis of the 
everyday life of the community, Muhammad hated idolatry from 
his childhood, and the Holy Quran is again our authority for the 



1 . LIFE OF THE HOLY PROPHET MUHAMMAD 1-2 1 

statement that he never bent his forehead before an idol (109:4). 
Though he lived in a city in which drinking orgies were only too 
common, never did a drop of alcohol touch his lips. Even Abu Bakr, 
the most intimate friend of the Prophet's youth, never tasted alcohol. 
The society at Makkah found pleasure in gambling, yet never did 
Muhammad take part in any such pastime. He lived among a people 
who were addicted to war as they were addicted to drinking, yet 
he had no liking for either. 

Above all, his earlier life was marked by that rare charac- 
teristic, rarest of all in Arabia at the time, love of the poor, the 
orphan, the widow, the weak, the helpless and the slave. Before he 
had affluence of means, he was one of the members who took an 
oath to stand by the oppressed and formed themselves into a league 
as champions of the injured. 

A highly-placed widow, Khadijah, hearing of the righteous- 
ness of Muhammad, entrusted to him the sole charge of her busi- 
ness. Before long, much profit accrued to her through his honest 
dealings. These dealings gave evidence of his high morals and it 
was this circumstance which led Khadijah to make a proposal for 
marriage. Thus was he married, at the age of twenty-five, to a 
widow, fifteen years older than himself.* After his marriage, he 
spent freely for the help of the poor. 

To these great qualities was added his anxiety for a fallen 
humanity. The Quran refers to it repeatedly (9:128, 18:6, 26:3, 
35:8). As years went on, the gross idolatry of the Arabs and their 
evil ways pressed the more heavily on his heart, and he spent 
hours in solitude in the neighbouring mountains. 

Raised to prophethood 

Shortly before he reached the age of forty, he began to immerse 
himself more frequently in solitary meditation. Retiring to a cave 
known as Hira, he would give himself up to Divine contemplation 
for days. Meanwhile, he received many visions, which came to 
fulfilment to the very letter. While thus absorbed in Divine

1-22 INTRODUCTION 



worship in the cave of Hira, the angel Gabriel appeared before him 
one night, in the month of Ramadan, in the year 609 C.E., with the 
first revelation (see 96: 1-5). This was the first day when the heavy 
responsibility of prophethood was placed on his shoulders. The 
right path in the quest of which he had been so long engaged was 
at last revealed to him. It was made known to him at the same 
time that the stupendous charge of human reformation was to 
rest on his shoulders. At first, he was in doubt whether he would 
be able to perform the great task, but his anxiety soon gave place 
to absolute faith that truth would ultimately triumph, and he set to 
work with a strength of will and an inflexibility of purpose which 
could not be shaken by the severest opposition of the whole of 
Arabia. 

From the very first his message was for all, for the Arab as 
well as the non-Arab, for the idolaters as well as the Jews, the Chris- 
tians and the Magi. Nor was it limited to the town of Makkah, for 
Makkah was the centre to which men and women flocked in 
thousands every year from all parts of Arabia, and through this 
assemblage the Prophet's message reached the most distant corners 
of Arabia. His wife, Khadijah, was the first to believe in him, and 
she was followed by others who were either his most intimate 
friends or closely related to him. 

His first revelations laid stress on the great power and majesty 
of the Divine Being and on the inevitability of the judgment. The 
Quraish mocked at first, treated him contemptuously and called 
him a madman. In spite of this he went on gaining adherents by 
twos and threes, until within four years the number reached forty 
and persecution grew bitter. At first the slaves were tortured. But 
the fire of persecution once kindled could not be confined. Converts 
of high birth were made to suffer along with the poorer followers. 
The Prophet himself did not escape the cruelties of the persecu- 
tors. The Muslims could not gather together or say their prayers in 
a public place. Still the Prophet Muhammad went on gaining new 
adherents, and his opponents became severer in their persecution, 
so much so that some of the humbler converts were put to death in 
a most brutal manner. 

The Prophet's tender heart melted at the sight of this brutal 



1 . LIFE OF THE HOLY PROPHET MUHAMMAD 1-23 

treatment of innocent men and women, and in spite of the fact that 
he would be left alone amongst exasperated opponents, he advised 
the small band of his followers to betake themselves to a place of 
safety. Eleven men and women left Makkah in the fifth year of the 
Prophet's mission, and migrated to Abyssinia. To there they were 
followed by a deputation of their opponents that petitioned the 
ruler of Abyssinia for their extradition. The Muslim case was put 
by their leader before the Christian king. The king was deeply 
touched by this statement and by a recitation from the Holy Quran, 
and refused to deliver the Muslims to their enemies. More Muslims 
went to Abyssinia next year, until the total reached 101, excluding 
children. The Quraish tried their utmost to check this tide of 
emigration, but in vain. Soon they became exasperated beyond all 
measure at the Prophet and the little band of Muslims that 
remained with him at Makkah. Not being able to prevail upon Abu 
Talib, the head of the Hashimites (the Prophet's family), to hand 
the Prophet over to them to end his life, and failing to tempt the 
Prophet by offering him kingship, wealth and beauty, they at last 
entered into a league and shut up the Hashimites and the Muslims 
in a small quarter, where they suffered the utmost privations for 
three long years, being allowed liberty of action only during the 
time of pilgrimage. These three years were the years of the hardest 
suffering for the Muslims, and Islam itself made little progress 
during this time. 

Released at last from this imprisonment, the Prophet, though 
facing disappointment on all sides, had still as much faith in the 
triumph of the truth as ever. If Makkah was now quite deaf to his 
preaching, he would turn elsewhere. He went to Ta'if, another 
great city of Arabia. Here, however, he found the ground even 
harder than at Makkah. He was not allowed to stay in Ta'if after 
ten days, and as he walked back he was pelted with stones. 
Dripping with blood and not even allowed by his persecutors to 
take rest, he at last returned to Makkah, a sadder man than when 
he had left it. 

Three years more passed away at Makkah amidst the most 
trying circumstances. In the meanwhile Islam took root in Madinah 
and spread fast. As the thirteenth year of his mission drew to a 
close, some Muslims from Madinah came to perform a pilgrimage 



1-24 INTRODUCTION 



and swore allegiance to the Prophet, affirming that if he chose to 
go to Madinah, they would defend him against his enemies just as 
they defended their own children and wives. Then it was that the 
Muslim exodus to Madinah commenced. 

The Prophet chose to remain alone amidst an enemy that was 
growing more and more exasperated, and to see his followers safe 
at the new centre. This shows the depth of his love and concern 
for his followers. He was anxious more for their safety than for his 
own. Within two months, about 150 Muslims left Makkah and 
there remained only the Prophet with two of his closest friends. 
His persecutors realised that if a final blow was not struck imme- 
diately, the Prophet might escape to Madinah and get beyond their 
reach. A big conference of all the tribes was held and a final 
decision taken. A youth from each clan was to be selected, and all 
these were to fall upon the Prophet at one and the same time, so that 
no particular clan should be held accountable for the murder. 

The Prophet's house was besieged by these youths as soon as 
it was dark, but, undaunted and having his faith in Divine protec- 
tion, the Prophet passed through them unnoticed. In the dark of 
the night, with only one companion, Abu Bakr, he made his way 
outside Makkah, and a hiding-place was ultimately found in a 
cave known as Thaur. When morning appeared, the enemy saw 
the failure of their plan and the whole countryside was scoured. 
One party reached the very mouth of the cave. Through a crevice, 
Abu Bakr saw the enemy at the mouth and grew anxious. "Do not 
grieve, for Allah is with us, " said the Prophet. The more helpless 
he became, the stronger grew his faith in God. After three days the 
Prophet and his companion started for Madinah. 

At Madinah 

The Prophet reached Madinah in June 622 C.E. The first thing that 
he did was to construct a mosque, now famous as the Prophet's 
Mosque. Here prayers to God were offered five times daily in a 
free atmosphere for the first time in the history of Islam. He next 
turned to establishing a brotherhood of the Muslims. Those who 
had fled from Makkah, called the Muhajirun (Refugees), had left 
all their property behind. So, to provide shelter for them, every 
refugee was bound in a bond of brotherhood with one of the 



1 . LIFE OF THE HOLY PROPHET MUHAMMAD 1-25 

residents of Madinah, called the Ansar (Helpers). The Prophet also 
established friendly relations between the various tribes living in 
Madinah. Among these were three Jewish clans, and a pact was 
concluded with them as well, according to which Muslims and 
Jews would live in peace and jointly defend Madinah against an 
external attack upon it. 

The battles 

The Quraish now became determined to uproot Islam. The Holy 
Prophet received an intimation from on High that the sword would 
be taken up against him and he would have to carry on a war to 
save Islam from utter annihilation. Temperamentally the Prophet 
Muhammad was not inclined to war; he had not once handled the 
sword in actual fighting up to the fifty-fifth year of his age, and 
this in a country where fighting had become a vocation of the 
people. The religion which he preached, Islam (meaning peace or 
submission), was a religion of peace, laying stress on prayer to 
God and the service of humanity, and he was required to preach 
this religion; to deliver the message, not to enforce it on others. 
But war was being forced on him, and it was his duty, he was told 
in his revelation from God, to defend his oppressed community 
who had twice fled their homes from the persecutions of a cruel 
enemy. There was no question of Muslims converting anyone to 
Islam by force; it was the enemy that wanted to turn back the 
Muslims by force from Islam (see 2:217). 

Small detachments of the Quraish used to go out on maraud- 
ing expeditions and scour the country right up to the outskirts of 
Madinah. The situation called for vigilance on the part of the 
Prophet. Reconnaissance parties were sent out by him to keep an 
eye on enemy movements and to approach certain tribes to secure 
their alliance or neutrality. One such party sent out with express 
orders to gather information about the Quraish movements acci- 
dentally killed a member of the Quraish. The usual practice in 
Arabia in such cases was to demand blood-money. But the Quraish 
wanted a pretext to rouse the populace against the Muslims, and 
this murder furnished it. Another pretext was furnished by a Quraish 
caravan coming from Syria just at this time. Knowing that the 
Muslims were still very weak, the Quraish thought that 1 ,000 men 



1-26 INTRODUCTION 



would be sufficient to annihilate them, and with this army they 
marched on Madinah in Ramadan, 2 A.H. 

When news of this reached Madinah, the Prophet made 
hurried preparations to meet them, but could gather only a force of 
313 Muslims. The two forces met at Badr, a distance of three days 
journey from Madinah and ten days from Makkah. The Prophet saw 
the weakness of his followers and in deep anxiety passed the night 
praying to God. But the unexpected happened. Almost all the 
Quraish chiefs, the ringleaders of the campaign against Islam, were 
slain in action. Seeing their chiefs fall, the rank and file were seized 
with confusion and took to flight. Seventy fell and an equal number 
were taken prisoners. There were fourteen casualties on the Muslim 
side. 

The Quraish defeat at Badr was an ignominy which they 
could not leave unavenged. An army of 3,000 strong, with formid- 
able warriors among them, marched on Madinah next year. The 
Muslims could muster no more than 700 men, and marched out of 
Madinah to meet the enemy at the foot of Uhud, only three miles 
from the city. The Muslims fought desperately and at first gained 
the upper hand. The Quraish took to flight and the Muslims pur- 
sued them, but just at this time the enemy noticed that the Muslim 
archers had left their rear undefended by vacating a certain posi- 
tion to join in the pursuit. Some of the Quraish wheeled round and 
attacked the Muslims from behind, while the main Quraish army 
turned back, and the handful of Muslims, in disorder on account of 
the pursuit, were thus pressed on both sides. The Prophet, braving 
the danger of himself becoming the target of the enemy's attack, 
called out aloud to his men to rally round him. This was a signal 
to the enemy to direct their attack to this particular point. The 
Muslims saw this and, cutting their way through the enemy ranks, 
mustered strongly round the Prophet. In this attempt they sus- 
tained serious losses, and the Prophet himself was seriously 
wounded, but the position of the Muslim army had become secure. 
Closing their ranks on elevated ground with the mountain protect- 
ing their retreat, they again made the enemy feel their strength. 
The Quraish retired from the field and took their way back to 
Makkah. 



1 . LIFE OF THE HOLY PROPHET MUHAMMAD 1-27 

Though the Quraish had this time inflicted severe losses on the 
Muslims, even this attack on Madinah had proved abortive. So after 
returning from Uhud, they tried to rouse the Jews and the Bedouin 
tribes against the Muslims, and in this they were successful. They 
all combined to deal a crushing blow to Islam. A large army of the 
Quraish and allied Arab tribes numbering more than 10,000 was 
gathered in the year 5 A.H., having the support of some Jews of 
Madinah. The Muslims, unable to meet these forces in the open 
field, fortified themselves in Madinah by digging a ditch on the 
side which was unprotected. The Prophet himself participated in 
digging the ditch like an ordinary labourer. The huge force at last 
reached Madinah. It was an hour of consternation, anguish and 
perplexity for the Muslims but their hearts were full of faith. 

During a full month of siege, the Muslims stood firm. Arrows 
and stones came in terrible showers but they could not break 
through the defence. Attacks were made and repulsed in quick 
succession. The siege became wearisome to the besieging army, 
which also began to run short of provisions. The elements of nature 
ultimately came to the help of the Muslim defence. A storm one 
night blew down the tents of the besiegers. There was confusion 
among them and they took to flight during the night, to the great joy 
and thanksgiving of the Muslims. 

The Quraish now lost all hope of being able to crush the 
Muslims. About a year after this, the Prophet with about 1400 
companions (Islam was gaining ground in spite of the wars) 
undertook a journey to Makkah to perform the lesser pilgrimage. 
But he found that the Quraish were prepared to offer armed 
resistance to his entry into Makkah, even though it was simply 
with the object of performing a religious obligation. He had to 
stop at about nine miles from the sacred city, at a place called 
Hudaibiyah. 

Emissaries were sent to find a peaceful solution. After a period 
of great anxiety and tension, a truce was in the end drawn up to 
last for a period of ten years, with the following conditions among 
others: (1) The Muslims shall return without performing a pilgri- 
mage, for which they may come back the following year. 
(2) Should any of the Makkans go over to Madinah, the Muslims 



1-28 INTRODUCTION 



shall hand him back to the Makkans, but if any of the Muslims go 
over to Makkah, the Quraish are under no obligation to return him 
to the Muslims. (3) The Arab tribes are at liberty to enter into 
alliance with whichever party they choose. 

It can easily be seen what a heavy price the Prophet was will- 
ing to pay for the sake of peace; he had agreed not to give shelter 
to those who were persecuted for accepting Islam, while his own 
men were free to join the unbelievers and find shelter in Makkah. 
The moral force drawing people to Islam was so great that while 
not a single Muslim went back to Makkah where he could find a 
sure shelter, scores of Makkans embraced Islam, and finding the 
doors of Madinah closed to them, settled themselves at 'Is, a place 
subject neither to the authority of the Prophet, nor to that of the 
Quraish. Islam was spreading in spite of the sword. 

After returning from Hudaibiyah, the Prophet made arrange- 
ments to send the message of Islam to all people, Christians as 
well as Magians, living on the borders of Arabia. He wrote letters 
to the sovereigns of the neighbouring kingdoms, the Emperor of 
Rome, Chosroes II of Persia, the king of Egypt, the Negus of 
Abyssinia and certain Arab chiefs, inviting them to Islam. Of the 
rulers addressed the Negus accepted Islam; the king of Egypt sent 
some presents in reply; the Roman Emperor was impressed but his 
generals were averse; while Chosroes tore up the letter and sent 
orders to the governor of Yaman to arrest the Prophet. When the 
governor's soldiers reached Madinah for the execution of the orders, 
the Prophet told them that Chosroes was himself dead and no more 
the king of Persia. They went back with this report to the governor 
of Yaman, and it was found that Chosroes II had actually been 
murdered by his own son on the very night indicated by the 
Prophet. This event led to the governor's conversion to Islam, and 
ultimately to Yaman's throwing off the yoke of Persia. 

Conquest of Makkah 

The truce of Hudaibiyah had hardly been in force for two years 
when the Banu Bakr, an ally of the Quraish, attacked the Khuza'a, 
an ally of the Muslims, with the help of the Quraish. The Prophet 
thereupon sent word to the Quraish that they should either pay 
blood money for those slain from among the Khuza'a or dissociate 



1 . LIFE OF THE HOLY PROPHET MUHAMMAD 1-29 

themselves from the Banu Bakr, or, in the last resort, declare the 
truce of Hudaibiyah to be null and void. The Quraish did not agree 
to either of the first two proposals, and the result was the annul- 
ment of the truce. The Prophet thereupon ordered an attack on 
Makkah in the closing months of the year 8 A.H. (629 C.E.) 

The two years during which the truce remained in force had 
brought such large numbers over to Islam that the Prophet now 
marched on Makkah with 10,000 men under his flag. The Makkans 
were unable to make any preparations to meet the attack. At Marr 
al-Zahran, a day's journey from Makkah, the Quraish leader, Abu 
Sufyan, sued for pardon, and though he was the arch-offender who 
had left no stone unturned to annihilate Islam, free pardon was 
granted to him by the Prophet. 

The conquest of Makkah was practically bloodless. The 
Quraish were unable to meet this force and the Prophet declared a 
general amnesty, guaranteeing safety to all those who entered Abu 
Sufyan' s house, or closed the doors of their own houses or entered 
the sacred precincts of the Ka'bah. Conversion to Islam formed no 
part of the conditions which guaranteed security of life and pro- 
perty. There were strict orders to the advancing army that there 
should be no bloodshed. There were only about a score of casual- 
ties due to some of the Quraish attacking a party of the Muslim 
forces. 

Makkah having thus been entered, the first thing that the Prophet 
did was to clear the Ka'bah of the idols. He then addressed the 
assembled Quraish who had been guilty of the most heinous 
offences against the Muslims. They were standing before him now 
as culprits who had persecuted Muslims, inflicted on them the 
severest tortures, put many of them to death and ultimately expelled 
them from Makkah. They had not even allowed the Muslims to 
live a peaceful life at their new home in Madinah, but had attacked 
that city three times with large forces which they knew the Muslims 
had no means to meet. 

It was these men who were now at the Prophet's mercy, and 
addressing them, he put to them the question: "What treatment do 
you expect from me?" They knew al-Amin of old; they knew he 
had a generous heart. "You are a noble brother, the son of a noble 



1-30 INTRODUCTION 



brother", was their unhesitating reply. But the treatment the 
Prophet accorded them exceeded even their own expectations. 
"This day, " he said in the words of Joseph to his brothers, "there is 
no reproach against you" (12:92). 

They were yet unbelievers, but mark the magnanimity of that 
great soul who would not even reproach them for their evil deeds, 
who let them go even without taking a pledge from them for the 
future. Not only was Makkah conquered, but with it were con- 
quered also the hearts of the bitterest foes of Islam. 

They now saw with their own eyes how the combined forces 
of opposition offered by the whole country had proved an utter 
failure against the mighty truth which came from the lips of a man 
who had stood alone in the midst of all opposition. The truth of 
the cause was now only too clear to them, and men and women 
came forward spontaneously to embrace the faith. There was not a 
single instance of conversion by force. 

Those that still adhered to the old religion were treated in the 
same spirit of friendliness as the members of the brotherhood. 
Even a hostile Western critic of Islam, Sir William Muir, had to 
admit this in these words: "Although the city had cheerfully 
accepted his supremacy, all its inhabitants had not yet embraced 
the new religion, or formally acknowledged his prophetical claim. 
Perhaps he intended to follow the course he had pursued at 
Madinah, and leave the conversion of the people to be gradually 
accomplished without compulsion" (The Life of Mahomet, ch. 25). 

Islam spreads throughout Arabia 

The fall of Makkah was a signal to the whole of Arabia. With the 
sole exception of the battle of Hunain, which had to be undertaken 
against the Hawazin tribe immediately after the conquest of 
Makkah, regular warfare between Muslims and non-Muslims in 
the whole of Arabia now came to an end, and even at Hunain, the 
unbelieving Makkans fought on the side of the Muslims. 

Islam was now free from trouble from within, but the Chris- 
tian power on the north viewed its strength with a jealous eye, and 
persistent news as to preparations of the Roman Empire to attack 
Arabia could not be ignored. Accordingly, an expedition of 30,000 



1 . LIFE OF THE HOLY PROPHET MUHAMMAD 1-3 1 

men was led by the Prophet personally to the northern frontier in 
the year 9 A.H. When he reached Tabuk, however, he found that 
his march had a restraining effect on the enemy, and there being 
no hostile force in the field, the Prophet returned without either 
attacking the Romans or declaring war against them. In fact, the 
Prophet always observed the Quranic injunction to fight only with 
those who took up the sword first to fight against the Muslims. 

After the return from Tabuk, peace was apparently established 
in the peninsula, but the Islamic territory was infested with hordes 
of marauders belonging to the tribes that had entered into agree- 
ments with the Muslim state, but had little respect for their 
treaties: "...those with whom you make an agreement, then they 
break their agreement every time, and they do not keep their duty" 
(8:56). These people had become a menace to the security of life 
and property, and accordingly, towards the end of the year 9 A.H., 
the Holy Prophet sent Ali to make an important declaration of 
immunity regarding such agreements at the annual pilgrimage at 
Makkah, an immunity of Muslims from their obligations towards 
such people. The declaration describes them as: "...those of the 
idolaters with whom you made an agreement" (9:1), and makes an 
exception in favour of those who had not violated their treaties: 
"except those of the idolaters with whom you made an agreement, 
then they have not failed you in anything and have not backed up 
anyone against you; so fulfil their agreement to the end of their 
term" (9:4). The result was that such tribes surrendered, and a 
settled condition of peace prevailed throughout the peninsula. 

This declaration of immunity towards the violators is some- 
times misrepresented as meaning an abrogation of the conditions 
of war laid down at the beginning: "And fight in the way of Allah 
against those who fight against you but do not be aggressive" 
(2:190). As a matter of fact, the condition laid down remained 
effective to the end. The Prophet's return from Tabuk, without 
attacking either the Roman territory or the territory of any other 
tribe, is a clear evidence of this. And even after the declaration of 
immunity, the Muslims were required to fight only with those who 
attacked them first: "Will you not fight a people who broke their 
oaths and aimed at the expulsion of the Messenger, and they 
attacked you first?" (9:13). 



1-32 INTRODUCTION 



Deputations which had already started coming to the Prophet 
in 9 A.H. to learn the truth about Islam now became more abun- 
dant. People came from all over Arabia and embraced Islam of 
their own free will. As soon as peace was established, Islam 
spread rapidly, and the year 10 A.H. witnessed the conversion of 
the whole of Arabia to Islam, including some Christian tribes. It 
was not only that idolatry was given up for the purest monotheism; 
it was a reformation in all spheres of life. The whole course of life 
of an entire nation was changed — ignorance, superstition and 
barbarism giving place to the spread of knowledge and to a 
rational outlook in all aspects of life. 

The "farewell" Pilgrimage 

At the end of the year 10 A.H., the Prophet set out to perform the 
pilgrimage to Makkah. As the whole of Arabia was now Muslim, 
there was not a single idolater in the huge concourse of 124,000 
pilgrims assembled at Makkah from all corners of the country. 
The very spot where the Prophet was only twenty years ago a 
rejected person, to whose word no one was willing to lend his ear, 
was now the scene of marvellous devotion to him. Everywhere he 
saw devoted friends who recognized him both as their temporal as 
well as their spiritual head — an inspiring manifestation of Divine 
power to him as well as to those who had assembled there. 

It was here, on the day of the assembling of the pilgrims at 
Mount Arafat, that he received a revelation which sent a thrill of 
joy through the vast gathering: "This day have I perfected your 
religion for you and completed My favour to you and chosen for 
you Islam as a religion" (5:3). The Prophet perceived that the 
message of the perfection of religion meant his approaching end. 
Here he delivered his famous sermon to the whole of Arabia 
through representatives of tribes coming from every quarter: 

"O people! Lend an attentive ear to my words, for I do not 
know whether I shall ever again have the opportunity to meet you 
here. I apprise you that your lives, your properties and your 
honour must be as sacred to one another as this sacred day in this 
sacred month in this sacred town. Let those present take this 
message to those absent. You are about to meet your Lord Who will 
call you to account for your deeds. . . 



1 . LIFE OF THE HOLY PROPHET MUHAMMAD 1-33 

"O people! This day Satan has despaired of re-establishing his 
power in this land of yours. But should you obey him even in what 
may seem to you a trifling matter, it will be a source of pleasure 
for him. So you must beware of him in the matter of your faith. 

"O my people! You have certain rights over your wives and 
so have your wives over you... They are the trust of Allah in your 
hands. So you must treat them with all kindness . . . And as regards 
your slaves, see that you give them to eat of what you yourselves 
eat and clothe them with what you clothe yourselves. 

"O people! Listen to what I say and take it to heart. You must 
know that every Muslim is the brother of another Muslim. You are 
all equal, and members of one brotherhood. It is forbidden to any 
of you to take from his brother save what he should willingly give. 
Do not do injustice to your people." 

Then the Prophet cried at the top of his voice: O Allah! I have 
delivered Your message, and the valley resounded with the words: 
Yes, you certainly have! 

A little while after his return to Madinah, the Holy Prophet fell 
ill. At first he went to the mosque to lead the prayers even during 
his illness, but later on he became too weak and appointed Abu 
Bakr to lead the prayers. After about twelve days' illness, he passed 
away on the 12th of the month of Rabi '-ul-Awwal on a Monday in 
1 1 A.H., corresponding to June 632 C.E., at the age of sixty-three. 
His last words were: Blessed companionship on High. 

The amazing transformation 

The most outstanding characteristic of the life of the Prophet 
Muhammad is the amazing success which he achieved. The trans- 
formation wrought within the short space of less than a quarter of 
a century is in fact unparalleled in the history of the world. There 
is not a single reformer who brought about such an entire change 
in the lives of a whole nation inhabiting such a vast country. 
None, in fact, found his people at such a depth of degradation as 
the Prophet found the Arabs, and no one raised them materially, 
morally and spiritually to the height to which he raised them. 

So deep-rooted was their idolatry, so powerful the bonds of 



1-34 INTRODUCTION 



their superstitions and their usages that the propagandic efforts of 
the Jews and the Christians, carried on for hundreds of years one 
after the other, could not bring about the least change in their con- 
dition. The indigenous Arab movement of the Hanifs proved an 
even greater failure. All these attempts at reform left the Arabs as 
a nation as ignorant of the principles of religion and morality as 
they ever were. 

Twenty-three years work of the Prophet, however, quite meta- 
morphosed them. Worship of idols and of all objects other than 
God, whether in heaven or on earth, was now considered to be a 
disgrace to humanity. The whole nation awakened to a sense of 
the true dignity of mankind and realized the folly of falling pros- 
trate before things which man was made to rule and before powers 
which he was required to conquer. Superstition gave place to a 
rational religion. The Arab was not only cleansed of deep-rooted 
vice and bare-faced immorality; he was further inspired with a 
burning desire for the best and noblest deeds in the service of, not 
country and nation, but, what is far higher than that, humanity. 
Old customs which involved injustice to the weak and the opp- 
ressed were all swept away, and just and reasonable laws took 
their place. Drunkenness, to which Arabia was addicted from time 
immemorial, disappeared entirely. The loose relations of the sexes 
gave place to the highest regard for chastity. The Arab who prided 
himself on ignorance became the lover of knowledge, drinking 
deep at every fountain of learning to which he could get access. 
And greatest of all, from an Arabia, the various elements of which 
were so constantly at war with each other that the whole country 
was about to perish, from these jarring and warring elements, the 
Prophet Muhammad welded together a nation, a united nation full 
of life and vigour, before whose onward march the greatest king- 
doms of the world crumbled as if they were but toys before the 
reality of the new faith. 

No man ever breathed such a new life on such a wide scale — 
a life affecting all branches of human activity; a transformation of 
the individual, of the family, of the society, of the nation, of the 
country, an awakening, material as well as moral, intellectual as 
well as spiritual. This unparalleled transformation has been ac- 
knowledged even by non-Muslim critics of Islam in their writings. 



2. THE HOLY QURAN AND ITS DIVISIONS 1-35 



2. The Holy Quran and its Divisions* 

The name Al-Qur'an, the proper name of the Sacred Book of the 
Muslims, occurs several times in the Book itself (2:185, etc.)- The 
word Qur 'an is an infinitive noun from the root qara 'a meaning 
he read or recited; and the Book is so called because it is or 
should be read; as a matter of fact, it is the most widely read book 
in the whole world. It is plainly stated to be a revelation from the 
Lord of the worlds (26:192), or a revelation from Allah, the Mighty, 
the Wise (39:1, etc.), and so on. It was sent down to the Prophet 
Muhammad (47:2), having been revealed to his heart through the 
Holy Spirit (26:193-194), in the Arabic language (26:195, 43:3). 
The first revelation came to the Holy Prophet in the month of 
Ramadan (2:185), on the 25th or 27th night, which is known as 
Lailat al-Qadr (97:1). 

Divisions 

The Holy Quran is divided into 1 14 chapters, each of which is called 
a surah. The word surah means literally eminence or high degree, 
and also any step of a structure, and in the Book itself it is applied 
to a chapter of the Quran (2:23). The chapters of the Holy Quran 
are of varying length, the largest comprising fully one twelfth of 
the entire Book — 286 verses — and the smallest containing only 
three verses. Each chapter is, however, complete in itself and is, 
therefore, called a book, and the whole of the Quran is said to con- 
tain many books (98:2-3). 

Each chapter contains a number of verses, a verse being called 
an ayah. The word ayah means, originally, an apparent sign or 
mark and, in this sense, it comes to mean a miracle, but it also sig- 
nifies a communication or a message from God and is applied as 
such to a verse of the Holy Quran as well as to a revelation or a 
law. In certain parts of the Muslim world the longer chapters are 
marked into sections, each section (known as a ruku") generally 
dealing with one subject. 



The material from here onwards has been abridged and adapted from the Intro- 
duction by Maulana Muhammad Ali in the full edition of his commentary. 



1-36 INTRODUCTION 



For the purposes of recitation, the Holy Quran is divided into 
30 parts of equal length, each called ajuz', to enable the reciter to 
complete its recitation in one month. Another division of the Book, 
traceable to the Prophet himelf, is into seven portions, each known 
as a manzil, to enable the reciter to complete its recitation in seven 
days. These divisions, however, have nothing to do with the 
subject-matter of the Quran. 

Revealed piecemeal but collected and arranged from the first 

The Quran was revealed piecemeal (25:32) during a period of 23 
years (609-632 C.E.), the shorter chapters generally, and some of 
the larger ones, being revealed entire and at one time, while the 
revelation of the majority of the larger chapters and some of the 
shorter chapters extended over many years. The practice was that 
when a chapter was revealed in parts, the Holy Prophet specified, 
under Divine guidance, the place of the verse revealed, and thus 
the arrangement of verses in each chapter was entirely his work. 

Similarly, later on when a considerable portion had been 
revealed, the arrangement of the chapters was also the work of the 
Holy Prophet himself. It is in one of the earliest revelations that 
the Holy Quran speaks of its collection as well as its revelation as 
being a part of the Divine scheme: "Surely on Us rests the collect- 
ing of it and the reciting of it" (75 : 1 7). The collection of the Holy 
Quran — which means the arrangement of its verses and chapters 
— was, therefore, a work which was performed by the Holy Prophet 
himself under Divine guidance, and it is a mistake to think that 
either Abu Bakr or Uthman was the collector of the Quran, though 
both of them did important work in connection with the dissemi- 
nation of the written copies of the sacred text. 

Abu Bakr made the first complete written copy, by arranging 
the manuscripts written in the time of the Holy Prophet, in the order 
of the oral recitation of the Prophet's time. Uthman's work, on the 
other hand, was only the ordering of copies to be made from the 
written manuscript of Abu Bakr's time and the placing of these 
copies in the various centres of Islamic learning, so that those who 
wrote the Holy Quran might be able to follow the standard copy. 
The text of the Holy Quran has thus been safeguarded from all 
alterations or corruptions in accordance with the Divine promise 



2. THE HOLY QURAN AND ITS DIVISIONS 1-37 

in one of the earliest revelations: "Surely We have revealed the 
Reminder, and surely We are its Guardian" (15:9). 

Revelations at Makkah and Madinah 

Another division of the Holy Book concerns the revelations received 
at Makkah and those received at Madinah. Of the 23 years over 
which the revelation of the entire Book is spread, 13 years were 
passed by the Holy Prophet at Makkah and 10 were passed at 
Madinah, to which city he had to flee for the safety of his own life 
and the lives of his followers in the year 622 C.E. Of the entire 
number of chapters, 93 were revealed at Makkah and 21 were 
revealed at Madinah, but the 1 1 0th chapter, though belonging to 
the Madinah period, was revealed at Makkah during the well- 
known Farewell Pilgrimage. 

The Madinan chapters, being generally longer, contain really 
about a third of the entire Quran. In arrangement, the Makkan reve- 
lation is intermixed with the Madinan revelation. Thus the Holy 
Quran opens with a Makkan revelation which is entitled the 
"Opening", and is followed by four chapters revealed at Madinah, 
which take up over one fifth of the whole Book. Then follow alter- 
nately Makkan and Madinan revelations. 

As regards the dates of the revelation of the various Makkan 
chapters, it is difficult to assign a particular year to a particular chap- 
ter, except in rare cases, but broadly they may be divided into three 
groups: those revealed in the early Makkan period, i.e., during the 
first five years; those revealed in the middle Makkan period, i.e., 
from the sixth to the tenth year; and those revealed during the late 
Makkan period, i.e., from the 1 1th year to the Flight (Hijrah). The 
dates of the Madinan chapters, on the other hand, are tolerably 
certain and definite, but in this case the difficulty is that the reve- 
lation of the longer chapters extended over lengthy periods, and a 
chapter which undoubtedly belongs to the earliest days at Madinah 
sometimes contains verses which were revealed in the closing days 
of the Holy Prophet's life. 

Chronological order 

The first five verses of the 96th chapter were undoubtedly the first 
revelation, and these were equally certainly followed by the first 



1-38 INTRODUCTION 



part of the 74th chapter, which again was, in all probability, follo- 
wed by the first chapter, after which came the first part of the 73rd 
chapter. Beyond this, it is impossible to give a tolerably certain 
order. The attempt to give a chronological order of chapters is an 
undoubted failure, as even the shorter chapters were not revealed 
entire. For instance, only verses 1 to 5 of chapter 96 were revealed 
first, verses 6 to 1 9 coming long afterwards as they refer to events 
of four years later. In case of chapter 2, its revelation undoubtedly 
began in 1 or 2 A.H., but it is equally certain that it contains 
verses which were revealed in 10 A.H. A chronological order of 
the different chapters is, therefore, an impossibility, and all that 
we can say with tolerable certainty is that the greater part of a cer- 
tain chapter was revealed during a certain period. 

Makkan and Madinan Revelations intermingled in the final 
arrangement 

In the present arrangement, chapters revealed at Makkah and those 
revealed at Madinah are intermingled. The reasons underlying this 
arrangement relate to the chief features which distinguish the Makkan 
from the Madinan revelations. While the Makkan revelations 
grounded the Muslims in faith in God, the Madinan revelation was 
meant to translate the faith into action. It is true that exhortations 
for good and noble deeds are met with in the Makkan revelations 
and that faith is still shown in the Madinan revelations to be the 
foundation on which the structure of deeds should be built, but, in 
the main, stress is laid in the former on faith in an Omnipresent 
and Omnipotent God Who requites every good and evil deed, while 
the latter deals chiefly with what is good and what is evil; in other 
words, with the details of the law. 

Another feature distinguishing the two revelations is that, while 
the Makkan revelation is generally prophetical, the revelation that 
came down at Madinah deals with the fulfilment of prophecy. 
Again, if the Makkan revelation shows how true happiness of mind 
may be sought in communion with God, the Madinan revelation 
points out how man's dealing with man may be a source of bliss 
and comfort to him. Hence, a judicious arrangement of the Holy 
Quran could be made to rest only on the intermingling of the two 
revelations. 



2. THE HOLY QURAN AND ITS DIVISIONS 1-39 

World's greatest spiritual force 

The Quran claims to be the greatest spiritual force which is ulti- 
mately destined to bring the whole of humanity to perfection. It 
opens thus: "Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds" (1:1), and 
it ends thus: "Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind" 
(114:1). The word for 'Lord' here, Rabb, means the Nourisher to 
perfection. 

It calls itself al-Ruh (42:52) or the Spirit which gives life to 
humanity, and time and again compares itself to the water which 
gives life to a dead earth (for example, see 41:39). The giving of 
life to the dead earth is a constant theme of the Quran and it is full 
of assurances that the dead earth will be raised to life spiritual: 
"Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its death" (57:17). It 
calls itself Shifa ' or Healing (10:57) to show that it heals all the 
spiritual diseases of humanity, and al-Nur or the Light (7:157) 
which will ultimately dispel all darkness from the surface of the 
earth. It calls itself al-Haqq or the Truth (17:81) which will ulti- 
mately take hold of the minds of people and before which false- 
hood will vanish, and al-Huda or the Guidance (72:13) which will 
make people ultimately attain the goal of life. 

The Quran claims that it is the only spiritual force which will 
ultimately conquer the whole world, and that the whole of humanity 
cannot produce such a spiritually effective force: "And if you are 
in doubt as to that which We have revealed to Our servant, then 
produce a chapter like it and call on your helpers besides Allah if 
you are truthful" (2:23). 

Unparalleled transformation wrought by the Quran 

In fact, the Holy Quran brought about a transformation unpara- 
lleled in the history of the world. It found the Arabs worshippers 
of idols, stones, trees, heaps of sand, and yet, within less than a 
quarter of a century, the worship of the One God ruled the whole 
country. It swept away all superstitions and gave in their place the 
most rational religion that the world could imagine. It declared 
man's thirst for knowledge to be insatiable (20:114). The Quran 
removed deep vices and evil social practices, and inspired its 
hearers with a burning desire for the best and noblest deeds in the 
service of humanity. No other faith ever imparted such a new life 



1-40 INTRODUCTION 



to its votaries on such a wide scale, a life affecting all branches of 
human activity. The Quran effected a transformation of humanity 
from the lowest depths of degradation to the highest pinnacle of 
civilization within an incredibly short time. 

Other unique characteristics 

Besides the unparalleled revolution brought about in the world by 
the Quran, it possesses two other characteristics equally unique — 
the wealth of ideas and the beauty of style. The effect produced by 
the Holy Quran was due merely to the greatness and reasonable- 
ness of the ideas clothed in the best of forms that appealed to the 
heart of man. A blaze of light was cast on all the great questions 
which had hitherto puzzled man. Hence it is, that one of the names 
by which the Holy Book speaks of itself is al-Burhan, or the Clear 
Argument, showing that argument was the weapon which it used 
to conquer the heart of man; and, as it appealed to reason and not 
to sentiment, its conquests were far-reaching and permanent. It is 
also called al-Bayan, or the Explanation, indicating that it had 
removed all obscurities in religious problems. It claimed not only 
to have perfected religion (5:3), and thus to have stated all 
religious truths needed for the moral and spiritual advancement of 
man, but also to have dealt with all objections to its truth: "And they 
cannot bring you a question, but We have brought you the truth 
and the best explanation" (25:33). 

The style and diction of the Quran have been universally 
praised. What, however, establishes the Quran's claim to unique- 
ness even in the outward form, apart from its subject and the 
effect produced, is the permanent hold that it has kept on the 
Arabic language itself the fact that it remains forever the standard 
by which the beauty of style and diction may be judged in Arabic 
literature. No other book in the world can be credited with even 
the achievement of keeping alive a language for thirteen centuries. 
The Quran has done this, attaining to the eminence of being the 
standard of eloquence for so long, and of retaining that position 
while the nation speaking it emerged from oblivion to become the 
leader of civilization in the world, leaving its home to settle in far 
distant lands where Arabic became either the spoken language of 
the masses or at least their literary language. 



3. RELATION TO EARLIER SCRIPTURES 1-41 

3. Relation to Earlier Scriptures 

Previous Scriptures recognized 

The Holy Quran requires a belief not only in its own truth but also 
in the truth of previous scriptures delivered to the prophets of 
different nations of the world. At its commencement, addressing 
the Holy Prophet, it lays down clearly that Muslims are those: 

"who believe in what has been revealed to you (O Prophet) 
and what was revealed before you. . ." — 2:4 

The universality of what was revealed before is clearly 
accepted: 

"And there is not a people but a warner has gone among 

them." — 35:24 

"And for every nation there is a messenger." — 10:47 

Lest anyone should be misled by the names of only a few 
prophets mentioned in the Holy Quran, it is stated: 

"And certainly We sent messengers before you (O Prophet) 

— among them are those We have mentioned to you and 
among them are those We have not mentioned to you." 

— 40:78; see also 4:164 

Thus the Holy Quran accepts the truth of the sacred books of 
the world, and hence it is again and again spoken of as a Book 
verifying that which is before it. The basis of the relation in which 
the Holy Quran stands to other scriptures is, therefore, that they 
are all members of one family; they all have a Divine origin. 

Guardian of previous scriptures 

The Verifier of the sacred books of the world, however, occupies a 
unique position among them. The relation in which the Holy Quran 
stands to earlier scriptures is thus lucidly set forth by the Holy Book 
itself: 

"And We have revealed to you (O Prophet) the Book with 
the truth, verifying what is (already) before it of the Book 
and a guardian over it. .." — 5:48 



1-42 INTRODUCTION 



The Quran is thus not only a verifier of the sacred books of all 
nations as stated above; it is also a guardian over them. In other 
words, it guards the original teachings of the prophets of God, for, 
as elsewhere stated, those teachings had undergone alterations, and 
only a revelation from God could separate the pure Divine teach- 
ing from the mass of error which had grown around it. Of all the 
scriptures, it has particularly chosen the Gospels to show in what 
ways erroneous doctrines had almost entirely suppressed the truth 
preached by a prophet of God. 

The Quran as a judge in existing differences 

The Holy Quran further claims that it came as a judge to decide 
the differences between the various religions: 

"We certainly sent (messengers) to nations before you (O 
Prophet), . . . and We have not revealed to you the Book 
except that you may make clear to them what they differ 
about..."— 16:63-64 

The Quran proclaimed that prophets had been raised in every 
nation, and, therefore, that every nation had received guidance from 
God, yet nation differed from nation even in the essentials of faith. 
The position of the Holy Quran was, therefore, essentially that of 
a judge deciding between these various claimants. 

It explains all obscurities 

Revelation, according to the Holy Quran, is not only universal but 
also progressive, and it attains perfection in the Final Revelation. 
A revelation was granted to each nation according to its require- 
ments, and in each age in accordance with the capacity of the 
people of that age. As the human brain became more and more 
developed, more and more light was cast by revelation on matters 
relating to the unseen, on the existence and attributes of the Divine 
Being, on the nature of revelation from Him, on the requital of good 
and evil, on life after death, and on paradise and hell. It is for this 
reason that the Holy Quran is again and again called a Book "that 
makes manifest". It shed complete light on the essentials of the 
faith and made manifest what had hitherto of necessity remained 
obscure. 



3. RELATION TO EARLIER SCRIPTURES 1-43 

Perfect revelation of Divine Will 

The Holy Quran claims that it came as a perfect revelation of 
Divine will: 

"This day have I perfected for you your religion and 
completed My favour to you and chosen for you Islam as 
a religion." — 5:3 

The finality of the Quranic revelation is, therefore, based on 
its perfection. New scriptures were revealed as long as they were 
needed, but when perfect light was cast on all essentials of reli- 
gion in the Holy Quran, no prophet was needed after Muhammad. 

A correct history 

The idea that the Quran has merely borrowed something from the 
earlier scriptures, especially from the Torah and the Gospels, must 
be examined in the light of facts. That the Quran deals with the 
religious topics which are dealt with in those books goes without 
saying; that it relates the history of some of the prophets whose 
history is also related in the Bible is also a fact, but to say that it 
borrows from those books is entirely wrong. 

Take first the essentials of religion as they are dealt with in 
the Holy Quran. Neither the Old nor the New Testament, nor any 
other sacred book, makes any approach to the grand and noble truths 
that find expression in the Holy Quran. Take next the histories of 
the prophets, as they are narrated in the Bible and as they are 
narrated in the Holy Quran, and you will find that the latter corrects 
the errors of the former as it does in the matter of religious 
doctrines. The Bible speaks of many of the prophets of God as 
committing the most heinous sins; it speaks of Abraham as telling 
lies and casting away Hagar and her son; it speaks of Lot as 
committing incest with his own daughters; it speaks of Aaron as 
making a calf for worship and leading the Israelites to its worship; 
it speaks of David as committing adultery with Uriah's wife; it 
speaks of Solomon as worshipping idols; but the Holy Quran accepts 
none of these statements, definitely rejects most of them and clears 
these prophets of the false charges against them. 



1-44 INTRODUCTION 



4. Liberal View of Other Religions 

Faith in all prophets 

There is a general misconception that the Quran preaches intolerance, 
and that Muhammad preached his faith with the sword in one hand 
and the Quran in the other. The basic principle of Islam, a faith in 
all the prophets of the world, is enough to give the lie to this alle- 
gation. The great and liberal mind that preached not only love and 
respect for the founders of the great religions of the world but 
much more than that, faith in them, could not shrink to the narrow- 
ness of intolerance for those very religions. Tolerance is not, in 
fact, the word that can sufficiently indicate the breadth of the 
attitude of Islam towards other religions. It preaches equal love for 
all, equal respect for all, and equal faith in all. 

No compulsion in religion 

Again, intolerance could not be ascribed to a book which altogether 
excludes compulsion from the sphere of religion: 

"There is no compulsion in religion." — 2:256 

In fact, the Holy Quran is full of statements showing that 
belief in this or that religion is a person's own concern, and that he 
is given the choice of adopting one way or another; that, if he 
accepts truth, it is for his own good, and that, if he sticks to error, 
it is to his own detriment. Given below are just two of these quota- 
tions: 

"The Truth is from your Lord; so whoever wishes, let him 
believe, and whoever wishes, let him disbelieve." — 
18:29 

"Clear proofs have indeed come to you from your Lord; 
so whoever sees, it is for the good of his own soul; and 
whoever is blind, it is to its harm. And I am not a keeper 
over you." — 6 : 1 04 

Why fighting was allowed 

The Muslims were allowed to fight indeed, but the object was not 
to compel the unbelievers to accept Islam, for it was against all the 
broad principles in which they had hitherto been brought up. It was 



4. LIBERAL VIEW OF OTHER RELIGIONS 1-45 

to establish religious freedom, to stop all religious persecution, to 
protect the houses of worship of all religions, mosques among 
them. To quote again from the Quran: 

"And fight with them until there is no more persecution, 
and all religions are for Allah." — 8:39 

"And if Allah did not repel some people by others, surely 
cloisters and churches and synagogues, and mosques in 
which Allah's name is much remembered, would have been 
pulled down." — 22:40 

The Holy Prophet and his companions were subjected to the 
severest persecution, as Islam began to gain ground at Makkah; 
over a hundred of them fled to Abyssinia, but persecution grew 
still more relentless. Ultimately, the Muslims had to take refuge in 
Madinah, but they were not left alone even there, and the sword 
was taken up by the enemy to annihilate Islam and the Muslims. 
The Quran bears express testimony to this: 

"Permission (to fight) is given to those on whom war is 
made, because they are oppressed. And surely Allah is Able 
to assist them — those who are driven from their homes 
without a just cause except that they say: Our Lord is 
Allah." —22:39-40 

Later, the express condition was laid down: 

"And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight 
against you but do not be aggressive. Surely Allah does 
not love the aggressors." — 2:190 

The Quran, therefore, allowed fighting only to save a persecuted 
community from powerful oppressors, and hence the condition was 
laid down that fighting was to be stopped as soon as persecution 
ended: 

"But if they cease, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merci- 
ful. And fight them until there is no persecution..." — 
2:192-193 

If the enemy offered peace, peace was to be accepted, though 
the enemy's intention might be only to deceive the Muslims: 



1-46 INTRODUCTION 



"And if they incline to peace, you (must) incline to it also, 
and trust in Allah. Surely He is the Hearer, the Knower. 
And if they intend to deceive you, then surely Allah is 
sufficient for you." — 8:61-62 

The Holy Prophet made treaties of peace with his enemies; 
one such treaty brought about the famous truce of Hudaibiyah, the 
terms of which were not only disadvantageous, but also humilia- 
ting to the Muslims. According to the terms of this treaty "if an 
unbeliever, being converted to Islam, went over to the Muslims, 
he was to be returned, but if a Muslim went over to the unbelie- 
vers, he was not to be given back to the Muslims". This clause of 
the treaty cuts at the root of all allegations of the use of force by 
the Holy Prophet. 

It is a mistake to suppose that the condition to fight "against 
those who fight against you" (2:190) was abrogated at any time. It 
remained in force to the end. There is not a single direction in the 
latest revelation on this subject, in ch. 9, The Immunity, that goes 
against this condition. The opening verse of that chapter speaks 
expressly of "idolaters with whom you made an agreement", and 
then, v. 4, excepts from its purview "those of the idolaters with 
whom you made an agreement, then they have not failed you in 
anything and have not backed up anyone against you", thus show- 
ing clearly that the "immunity" related only to such idolatrous 
tribes as had first made agreements with the Muslims and then, 
violating them, killed and persecuted the Muslims wherever they 
found them, as v. 10 says expressly: "They respect neither ties of 
relationship nor covenant in the case of a believer". Further on in 
ch. 9, the condition of the enemy attacking the Muslims first is 
plainly repeated: "Will you not fight a people who broke their 
oaths and aimed at the expulsion of the Messenger, and they 
attacked you first?" (9:13). 

The waging of war on unbelievers to compel them to accept 
Islam is a myth pure and simple, a thing unknown to the Holy Quran. 
It was the enemy that waged war on the Muslims to turn them 
away from their religion, as the Holy Book so clearly asserts: 
"And they will not cease fighting you until they turn you back 
from your religion, if they can" (2:217). 



4. LIBERAL VIEW OF OTHER RELIGIONS 1-47 

Relations of friendship with others 

It is sometimes asserted that the Quran forbids relations of friend- 
ship with the followers of other religions. How could a Book which 
allows a man to have as his comrade in life a woman following 
another religion (5:5), say in the same breath that no friendly rela- 
tions can be had with the followers of other religions? The loving 
relation of husband and wife is the friendliest of all relations and, 
when this is expressly permitted, there is not the least reason to 
suppose that other friendly relations are forbidden. The fact is that, 
wherever there is prohibition against making friends with other 
people, it relates only to the people who were at war with the 
Muslims, and this is plainly stated in the Quran: 

"Allah does not forbid you, with regard to those who do 
not fight you for religion, nor drive you forth from your 
homes, that you show them kindness and deal with them 
justly. Surely Allah loves the doers of justice. Allah forbids 
you only with regard to those who fight you for religion, 
and drive you forth from your homes and help (others) in 
your expulsion, that you make friends of them; and who- 
ever makes friends of them, these are the wrongdoers." 
— 60:8-9 

No punishment for apostasy 

It is generally thought that the Quran provides a death sentence for 
those who desert the religion of Islam. Anyone who reads the Quran 
will see that there is not the least ground for such a supposition. 
The Quran speaks repeatedly of people going back to unbelief after 
believing, but never once does it say that they should be killed or 
punished. For example: 

"And whoever of you turns back from his religion, then 
he dies while an unbeliever — these it is whose deeds are 
fruitless in this world and the Hereafter." — 2:217 

"Those who disbelieve after their believing, then increase 
in disbelief, their repentance is not accepted, and these are 
they that go astray." — 3:90 

On the other hand, the Quran speaks of a plan of the Jews to 
adopt Islam first and then desert it, thus creating the impression 



1-48 INTRODUCTION 



that Islam was not a religion worth having (3:72). Such a scheme 
could never have entered their heads while living at Madinah, 
where the Government was Muslim, if apostasy, according to the 
Quranic law, were punishable with death. The misconception seems 
to have arisen from the fact that people who, after becoming apos- 
tates, joined the enemy, were treated as enemies, or that, where an 
apostate took the life of a Muslim, he was put to death, not for 
changing his religion, but for committing murder. 

5. The Position of Woman 

Spiritually woman raised to the position of man 

No other religious book and no other reformer has done even a 
small fraction of what the Holy Quran or the Prophet Muhammad 
has done to raise the position of woman. Read the Quran and you 
find good and righteous women being given the same position as 
good and righteous men. Both sexes are spoken of in the same 
terms. The highest favour which God has bestowed upon man is 
the gift of Divine revelation, and we find women, to whom Divine 
revelation came, spoken of along with men: 

"And We revealed to Moses' mother, saying: Suckle him; 
then when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do 
not fear, nor grieve; surely We shall bring him back to you 
and make him a messenger (of Ours)." — 28:7 

"And when the angels said: O Mary, surely Allah has chosen 
you and purified you and chosen you above the women of 
the world." — 3:42 

Further, where the Holy Quran speaks of the great prophets of 
God, saying: "And mention Abraham in the Book" (19:41), "And 
mention Moses in the Book" (19:51), and so on, it speaks of a 
woman in exactly the same terms: "And mention Mary in the 
Book" (19:16). No other religious book has given such a high 
spiritual position to woman. 

The Quran makes no difference between man and woman in 
the bestowal of reward for the good he or she does: 



5. THE POSITION OF WOMAN 1-49 

"And whoever does good deeds, whether male or female, 
and is a believer — these will enter the Garden, and they 
will not be dealt with unjustly in the least." — 4: 124 

"Whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a 
believer, We shall certainly make him live a good life, and 
We shall certainly give them their reward for the best of 
what they did." — 16:97 

Also, 33:35, speaking of good women alongside of good men, 
enumerates every good quality as being possessed by women exactly 
as it is possessed by men, and ends with the words: "Allah has 
prepared for them forgiveness and a mighty reward". With God, 
therefore, according to the Quran, there is no difference between 
men and women, and morally and spiritually they can rise to the 
same eminence. 

Woman is the equal of man in rights of property 

On the material side, too, we find no difference, except what nature 
requires for its own ends. A woman can earn, inherit and own 
property and dispose of it just as a man can, and the Holy Quran is 
explicit on all these points: 

"For men is the benefit of what they earn. And for women 
is the benefit of what they earn." — 4:32 

"For men is a share of what the parents and the near rela- 
tives leave, and for women a share of what the parents 
and the near relatives leave." — 4:7 

Woman, in Arabia, had no rights of property; in fact, she her- 
self was part of the inheritance, and was taken possession of along 
with other property. She had no right to the property of her deceased 
husband or father. The Quran took her from this low position and 
raised her to a position of perfect freedom as regards her property 
rights and her right to inheritance, a position which, among other 
nations, she has only partly attained and that after centuries of hard 
struggle. 

Polygamy 

It is, however, asserted that polygamy and the seclusion of women, 



1-50 INTRODUCTION 



as enjoined in the Holy Quran, have done more harm to woman 
than the benefit conferred on her by bestowal of property rights. 
The fact is that a great misunderstanding exists on these two points. 
Monogamy is the rule in Islam and polygamy only an exception 
allowed subject to certain conditions. The following two verses 
are the only authority for the sanction of polygamy, and let us see 
how far they carry us: 

"And if you fear that you cannot do justice to orphans, 
marry such women as seem good to you, two, or three, or 
four; but if you fear that you will not do justice, then 
marry only one or what your right hands possess. This is 
more proper that you may not do injustice. . ." — 4:3 

"And they ask you (O Prophet) a decision about women. 
Say: Allah makes known to you His decision concerning 
them; and what is recited to you in the Book is concern- 
ing widowed women, whom you do not give what is 
appointed for them, while you are not inclined to marry 
them..." — 4:127 

Now the first of these verses allows polygamy on the express 
condition that "you cannot do justice to orphans", and what is 
meant is made clear by the second verse, which contains a clear 
reference to the first verse in the words, "what is recited to you in 
the Book is concerning widowed women". The Arabs were guilty 
of a double injustice to widows: they did not give them and their 
children a share in the inheritance of their husbands, nor were they 
inclined to marry widows who had children, because the responsi- 
bility for the maintenance of the children would in that case 
devolve upon them. The Quran remedied both these evils; it gave 
a share of inheritance to the widow with a share also for the orphans, 
and it commended the taking of such widows in marriage, and 
allowed polygamy expressly for this purpose. It should, therefore, 
be clearly understood that monogamy is the rule in Islam and poly- 
gamy is allowed only as a remedial measure, for the sake of 
widows and orphans. 

This permission was given at a time when the wars, which were 
forced on the Muslims, had decimated the men, so that many 
widows and orphans were left for whom it was necessary to provide. 



5. THE POSITION OF WOMAN 1-5 1 

A provision was made in the form of polygamy so that the widow 
should find a home and protector and the orphans should have 
paternal care and affection. Nature will have its course, and allow- 
ing illicit sexual relations is the inevitable alternative to a limited 
polygamy. 

Seclusion 

As regards the seclusion of women, the Quran never prohibited 
women from going out of their houses for their needs. In the time 
of the Prophet, women went regularly to mosques, and said their 
prayers along with men, standing in a separate row. They also joined 
their husbands in the labour of the field; they even went with the 
army to the field of battle, and looked after the wounded, remo- 
ving them from the field, if necessary, and helped fighting-men in 
many other ways. They could even fight the enemy in an emer- 
gency. No occupation was prohibited to them, and they could do 
any work they chose. The only restrictions on their liberty are con- 
tained in the following verses: 

"Say to the believing men that they lower their gaze and 
restrain their sexual passions. That is purer for them. 
Surely Allah is Aware of what they do. And say to the 
believing women that they lower their gaze and restrain 
their sexual passions and do not display their adornment 
except what appears of it. And they should wear their 
head-coverings over their bosoms." — 24:30-31 

Now the real restriction contained in these verses is that both 
men and women should, when they meet each other, cast down their 
looks, but there is an additional restriction in the case of women 
that they should not display their adornment with the exception of 
"what appears of it". The exception has been explained as 
meaning "what is customary and natural to uncover". That women 
went to mosques with their faces uncovered is a fact recognized 
by all, and there is also a saying of the Holy Prophet that, when a 
woman reaches the age of puberty, she should cover her body 
except the face and the hands. The majority of the commentators 
are also of opinion that the exception relates to the face and the 
hands. Hence, while a display of beauty is forbidden, the restric- 
tion does not interfere with the necessary activities of woman. She 



1-52 INTRODUCTION 



can do any work that she likes to earn her livelihood, for the Holy 
Quran says plainly, as already quoted, that women shall have the 
benefit of what they earn. A limited seclusion and a limited 
polygamy do not, therefore, interfere with the necessary activities 
of woman; they are both meant for her protection and as preven- 
tives against loose sexual relations, which ultimately undermine 
society. 



6. Purity of the Quranic Text 

Among all the religious books of the world, the Holy Quran is the 
only Book which enjoys the distinction of having a pure text. 
Every word and letter of the Holy Book, as we have it today, is as 
it left the lips of the Holy Prophet Muhammad to whom the Book 
was revealed, and it is for this reason that, through all the cen- 
turies since it was revealed and among all the Muslims from East 
to West, among the numerous contending sects, there is only one 
Quran. The factors which contributed to this safe preservation of 
the text are its being reduced to writing under the direction of the 
Prophet himself and its being committed to memory by a large 
number of people, at the time of its revelation. 

Every portion of the Quran was written as it was revealed — 
internal evidence 

There is a hint as to the use of the pen in the very first revelation 
that came to the Holy Prophet: 

"Read in the name of your Lord Who creates — creates 
man from a clot (of blood) — read and your Lord is most 
Generous, Who taught by the pen, taught man what he 
did not know." — 96: 1-5 

In the very first message that the Holy Prophet received from 
on High, he is told not only to read but also to seek the help of the 
pen, which was the only means of the preservation of knowledge. 
It was due to this that from the very first he made arrangements to 
have every revelation reduced to writing as it came down to him, 
in addition to having it committed to memory, which he did by 
reading it out to those around him. Moreover, the Holy Quran 



6. PURITY OF THE QURANIC TEXT 1-53 

itself furnishes abundant evidence that it existed in a written form. 
It again and again calls itself a kitab, which means a book, or a 
writing which is complete in itself. 

There are many other references in the Holy Quran showing 
that its chapters existed in a written form at an early date. Thus: 

"Surely it is a bountiful Quran, in a book that is protected, 
which none touches but the purified ones." — 56:77-79 

Historical evidence as to the writing of the Quran 

There are numerous anecdotes showing that when the Holy Prophet 
received a revelation, it was immediately reduced to writing. The 
general practice is thus described, by no less a personage than 
Uthman, the third Caliph whose name is in particular associated 
with the collection of the Quran and who, being one of the earliest 
converts to Islam, remained with the Prophet almost since the 
beginning of his mission: 

"It was customary with the Messenger of Allah, when 
portions of different chapters were being revealed to him, 
that when any verse was revealed, he called one of those 
persons who used to write the Quran and said to him, 
Write these verses in the chapter where such and such 
verses occur." — (Abu Dawud, 2:123; Tirmidhi, Abwdb 
Tafsir-ul-Qur 'an, on Surah 9) 

This report mentions, not what the Holy Prophet did on one 
occasion, but what he always used to do whenever any verse of 
the Holy Quran was revealed to him. 

Every portion committed to memory 

Every portion of the Quran was committed to memory as soon as 
it was revealed. With the Arabs, memory was the safest of reposi- 
tories. They had learnt all their poems and long genealogies by 
heart. We learn from numerous reports that whenever a passage 
was revealed, it was recited by the Holy Prophet to those who 
happened to be present at the time and many of his followers 
committed it to memory at once, others again learning it from 
those who heard it from the mouth of the Prophet. The Com- 
panions believed every word of the revelation to proceed from no 



1-54 INTRODUCTION 



other than the Divine source, so they secured it in the securest of 
places, viz., their hearts. 

The Holy Prophet himself set an example in frequently reci- 
ting the Quran in public as well as in private. It was not only in 
prayers that long portions of the Holy Book were recited. We have 
on record instances showing that the Prophet recited the Quran 
when travelling on the back of a camel (Bukhari, 66:24). He also 
loved to hear others recite the Quran. 

There are many trustworthy reports which show that there were 
numerous men among the Companions who could recite the whole 
Quran from memory. Seventy of them were treacherously put to 
death by a tribe of the unbelievers (Bukhari, 64:30). The fact that 
such a large number of them were murdered in the lifetime of the 
Holy Prophet shows that there were hundreds of them among the 
Companions. 

Arrangement was Prophet's work 

That the arrangement of the verses and chapters of the Holy Quran 
was effected by the Holy Prophet under the guidance of Divine 
revelation is shown in the first place by the Holy Quran itself. 
There we read: 

"Surely on Us rests the collecting of it and the reciting of 
it. So when We recite it, follow its recitation." — 75:17— 
18 

This is one of the very earliest revelations, showing that the 
collection of the Holy Quran, that is, its gathering into one whole, 
with an arrangement of its various parts, was according to the 
Divine scheme to be brought about by the guidance of Divine 
revelation. 

In another chapter, revealed a little later, we have the follow- 
ing words addressed to the Holy Prophet: 

"And those who disbelieve say: Why has not the Quran 
been revealed to him all at once? It is so that We may 
strengthen your heart with it and We have arranged it 
well in arranging." — 25:32 



6. PURITY OF THE QURANIC TEXT 1-55 

The Quran itself, therefore, makes it clear that its collection 
and arrangement were also brought about by Divine revelation. 

We meet with the clearest proof in authentic and reliable 
reports that the Holy Prophet left at his death the complete Quran 
with the same arrangement of the verses and chapters as we have 
now in every Arabic Quran. That such a large book, treating so 
many and such varied subjects, should have been committed to 
memory and regularly recited in and outside prayers, and taught 
by one man to another, without there being any settled arrange- 
ment of its parts, is a most preposterous proposition. 

The practice of the Holy Prophet has already been referred to 
in a report quoted earlier, in which Uthman tells us: "It was custo- 
mary with the Messenger of Allah, when portions of different 
chapters were being revealed to him, that when any verse was 
revealed, he called one of those persons who used to write the 
Quran and said to him, Write these verses in the chapter where 
such and such verses occur." From this it appears that the place 
and chapter for every verse were pointed out by the Holy Prophet 
himself. 

There is a report in Bukhari (64:12) as follows: "The Holy 
Prophet said, Whoever reads the last two verses of the chapter 
entitled Baqarah on any night, they are sufficient for him". This 
shows that the Holy Prophet himself followed an arrangement which 
he had made known to his Companions, and they all followed the 
same arrangement; otherwise, he could not have referred to two 
verses as the last two verses of a certain chapter. This and 
numerous other Hadith reports show conclusively that the arrange- 
ment of verses in the chapters was the Prophet's own work. That 
this arrangement was the same as that followed now in the copies 
of the Holy Quran is shown by the absence of any other arrange- 
ment in the whole Muslim world. 

Conclusive evidence shows that not only the verses but even 
the chapters of the Quran were arranged by the Holy Prophet. 

Abu Bakr collected original written manuscripts of the Quran 

The primary work of the collection of the Holy Quran was done 
by the Holy Prophet himself under the guidance of Divine revelation. 



1-56 INTRODUCTION 



Such collection was needed only by those who wished to commit 
the whole of the Quran to memory and it was in reciting the whole 
that the arrangement of chapters was needed. Hence, though the 
whole Quran existed in a complete and arranged form in the 
memories of the Companions, yet there did not exist an authorized 
collection of it in writing. So long as the recipient of the Divine 
revelation lived, the whole could not be written in a single volume 
as at any time a verse might be revealed which it was necessary to 
place in the middle of a chapter. Such a collection became, how- 
ever, a necessity after the death of the Holy Prophet. It was also 
needed to facilitate reference to and circulation of the Holy Word, 
and to give it a more permanent form than was secured to it in 
being consigned to memory. Such was the object with which the 
collection of the Holy Quran was taken in hand by Abu Bakr. 

Soon after the death of the Holy Prophet, the Muslims fought 
a battle at Yamamah, in which many of those who had committed 
the whole of the Quran to memory lost their lives. Thereupon Umar 
urged Abu Bakr to give immediate orders for the collection of the 
Quran, fearing that more of the reciters may be killed in the future. 
When Abu Bakr was convinced of this course, he sent for Zaid ibn 
Thabit and said: 

"You used to write the revelations of the Prophet. Search, 
therefore, for (the written portions of) the Quran and 
collect it (into one volume)." 

So heavy did the task appear to Zaid that at that time he 
thought: "It would not have been more difficult for me, if I had 
been asked to remove a mountain". But at last he was prevailed 
upon, and began the search (Bukhari, 65.9: 20). 

There was nothing to be feared so long as the reciters were 
safe, but if they perished in battles then it was feared certain por- 
tions of the Holy Quran might be lost, because the manuscripts of 
different chapters and verses had not been up to that time collec- 
ted in one place. The report shows that the entire Quran was safe 
in the memories of the reciters, and Umar only desired to make a 
collection of the Quran in writing in addition to the collection exist- 
ing in the memories of the reciters. 



6. PURITY OF THE QURANIC TEXT 1-57 

The object of the collection undertaken by Abu Bakr was to 
gather together what had been written in the presence of the Holy 
Prophet. Zaid's collection was meant to secure the original wri- 
tings, and this was the great difficulty to which Zaid alluded. Zaid 
was chosen for the task because he had written the greater portion 
of the revelation at Madinah and was presumed to have all those 
copies safe in his custody. But the task before him was a very 
difficult one. He had to search all the original writings and then 
give them an arrangement in accordance with that of the verses 
and chapters as followed in the recitation of the entire Quran from 
memory, in obedience to the directions given by the Holy Prophet. 
That these writings were safe cannot be doubted. Everything rela- 
ting to Divine revelation was preserved with the utmost care. But 
the task was no doubt an arduous one, and required hard labour 
and diligent search. 

Hence also the first direction of Abu Bakr to Zaid was to 
"search for the Quran and collect it", and it is easy to see that a 
search had only to be made for writings. If the object of the new 
collection for which Umar contended were simply to reduce the 
Quran to writing as recited by those who had committed the whole 
of it to memory, sufficient accuracy could have been obtained by 
gathering together a few reciters, and Zaid had only to write out 
the Holy Quran as dictated by them and approved by the Com- 
panions. But Umar's object and Abu Bakr's orders were to gather 
the original writings which had been written according to the direc- 
tions of the Holy Prophet himself, and thus to make the accuracy 
of the text doubly certain. 

Accuracy of Zaid's collection 

The most important question with regard to the collection made 
under the orders of Abu Bakr is: Did it accord in every respect 
with the Quran as stored and collected in the memories of the 
Companions, and as repeated and recited, publicly as well as 
privately, in the lifetime of the Holy Prophet? There is not the 
least reason to believe that it did not. In the first place, none of the 
compilers was actuated by any motive to make any change in the 
text. The earnest desire of all those engaged in the task was to 
have a complete and faithful collection of what had been revealed 



1-58 INTRODUCTION 



to the Holy Prophet. Secondly, the collection began only six months 
after the death of the Holy Prophet, while almost all of those who 
had heard the Quran from his lips were still alive. Thirdly, there 
were many among them who could repeat the whole of the Quran 
from memory. There were others who knew large portions, and 
these were kept fresh in memory by constant recitation in and apart 
from prayers. It was impossible that any variation from the text as 
prevalent in the time of the Holy Prophet should have found its 
way into the collection in the presence of such men. Fourthly, 
there were many transcripts of the revelations current among the 
Companions. And since every verse was written at the time of its 
revelation, and copies of it were then made by the Companions, 
there were ample means of testing the accuracy of the collection 
of Zaid. Memory and writing thus corroborated the already 
unimpeachable testimony afforded by each. 

Uthman ordered further copies from Abu Bakr's original 
collection 

The collection thus made remained, we are told, in the possession 
of Abu Bakr, and after his death in that of Umar. After the latter' s 
death, the copy was transferred to the custody of Hafsah, the 
daughter of Umar, and a widow of the Holy Prophet. Thus the 
collection made by the orders of Abu Bakr came down to the reign 
of Uthman without any alteration in its text or arrangement. But 
some circumstances coming to the notice of Uthman, he deemed it 
necessary to circulate official copies, transcribed by official scribes, 
and suppress all those made by private persons, either from the 
collection of Zaid or from other writings still prevalent among 
them. 

The circumstances which made it necessary are thus des- 
cribed: 

"Ans relates that there came to Uthman, Hudhaifah who 
had been fighting with the people of Syria in the conquest 
of Armenia and with the people of Iraq in Azarbaijan, and 
who was alarmed at their variations in the modes of read- 
ing, and he said to Uthman: 'O Commander of the Faith- 
ful, stop the people before they differ in the Holy Book as 
the Jews and the Christians differ in their Scriptures'. So 



6. PURITY OF THE QURANIC TEXT 1-59 

Uthman sent word to Hafsah asking her to send him the 
Quran in her possession, so that they might make other 
copies of it and then send the original copy back to her. 
Thereupon Hafsah sent the copy to Uthman, and he 
ordered Zaid ibn Thabit and Abdullah ibn Zubair and Sa'id 
ibn al-As and Abdur Rahman ibn Harith ibn Hisham, and 
they made copies from the original copy. Uthman also said 
to the three men who belonged to the Quraish (Zaid being 
a Madinite): 'When you differ with Zaid in anything 
concerning the Quran, then write it in the language of the 
Quraish, for it is in their language that it was revealed'. 
They obeyed these instructions, and when they had made 
the required number of copies from the original copy, 
Uthman returned the original to Hafsah and sent to every 
quarter one of the copies thus made, and ordered all other 
copies or leaves on which the Quran was written to be 
burned." (Bukhari, 66:3) 

It was only in newly converted countries, where Arabic was 
not spoken, that these differences were noticed. As to the nature of 
these differences, it is stated in clear words that they were only 
differences in modes of reading. But it was feared that, if nothing 
was done to put a stop to the slight differences existing at that 
time, they might, after the lapse of a few generations, develop into 
serious ones. 

The report tells us that, when variations of readings were 
brought to the notice of Uthman, the only action that he took was 
to obtain the collection made in the time of Abu Bakr, and to have 
other copies transcribed from it for circulation. Thus copies of the 
Quran transcribed under his orders were true and faithful copies of 
the collection of Abu Bakr, which, as we have seen, was in the 
custody of Hafsah after the death of Umar. Zaid was one of the 
men who were now called upon to make fresh copies from it. To 
remove any difference of dialect or variation in the mode of 
writing certain words that might possibly arise, Uthman gave the 
orders that the reading of the Quraish should be adopted in pre- 
ference to any other reading. But the only example of such varia- 
tion that has been preserved to us in reports is that Zaid read a 
word as tabuh and the Quraish read it as tabut, there being a very 



1-60 INTRODUCTION 



slight difference as to the manner in which the final letter of the 
word was to be written, without there being the slightest change in 
significance; and such importance was given to this trifling 
difference that the matter was reported to Uthman for decision. 
Hence we have conclusive testimony in our hands showing that 
the copies of the Quran made and circulated under the orders of 
Uthman were exact and faithful copies of the original collection of 
Zaid made in the time of Abu Bakr. Had there been any difference 
between the original and the copies made, it would no doubt have 
come to light in the long reign of Uthman or in that of Ali, when 
Muslims had been divided into factions, and that copy was still in 
the possession of Hafsah. 

The present Quranic text is exactly as the Prophet left it 

The work of collecting the written manuscripts of the Quran was 
thus carried out by Abu Bakr after the death of the Holy Prophet, 
and Uthman did nothing but order the necessary number of copies 
to be made from Abu Bakr's collection. He acted after consulta- 
tion with the Companions, securing the services of the most 
eminent men who were noted for their knowledge of the Quran to 
carry out and superintend the work of the transcription. The copies 
made by his orders were recognized as true copies by the whole 
Muslim world, and these copies have admittedly remained 
unaltered through the centuries that have since elapsed. 



A Summary of the Holy Quran 

The Holy Book is prefaced with a short Makkan chapter which, in 
its seven short verses, contains the essence of the whole of the 
Quran, and teaches a prayer which is admittedly the most beautiful 
of all prayers taught by any religion, and which sets before man an 
ideal greater than any other which can be conceived. If the preface 
is the quintessence of the Quran and places before man the highest 
ideal, the commencement of the Book is equally logical, for the 
second chapter opens with a clear statement as to its aims and objects. 
Chapters 2 to 5 all belong to the Madinan revelation and, occupy- 
ing as they do over a fifth of the whole Quran, deal in detail with 
the teachings of Islam, comparing them with the previously existing 
teachings, particularly Jewish and Christian, which had by that 
time become the prototypes of error in religion, the former laying 
too much stress on outward ritual, while utterly neglecting the 
spirit, and the latter condemning law itself, trusting to faith in 
Christ alone. The greater part of Islamic law dealing with the 
individual, home and civic life of man is contained in these four 
chapters. 

These are followed by two of the longest Makkan chapters, 6 
and 7, the first of which deals in detail with the doctrine of Divine 
Unity, and the second with that of prophethood. This latter chapter 
illustrates the doctrine of prophethood with reference to the histories 
of some well-known prophets. These two are again followed by 
two Madinan chapters, which fit in with the context, as they show 
how opposition to Truth as revealed to the Holy Prophet was dealt 
with: the first of these — the 8th — deals with their discomfiture 
in the first struggle in the battle of Badr and the second — the 9th 
— with their final vanquishment. 

Then follows a group of seven Makkan chapters (10th to 16th), 
the Alif Lam Rd group, dealing with the truth of the Holy Prophet's 
revelations, internal evidence, evidence from man's nature, from 
the histories of the previous prophets and from external nature, being 
produced to establish that truth. Another group of five Makkan 
chapters follows it, all dealing with the greatness to which Islam

1-62 A SUMMARY OF THE HOLY QURAN 

was destined to rise, with special reference to Jewish history in ch. 
17, to Christian history and doctrine in ch. 18 and ch. 19, to the 
history of Moses in ch. 20, and to the history of prophets in general 
and their deliverance in ch. 2 1 . Two more Makkan chapters follow, 
the 22nd showing that the Prophet's cause must triumph, though 
the faithful would be required to make great sacrifices for the 
cause of Truth, and the 23rd showing that the foundation on which 
the greatness of the Muslim nation rested was moral, not material. 
A Madinan chapter — the 24th — is then brought in to show how 
the prophecies of the Makkan revelations were being brought to 
fulfilment by the establishment of a Muslim kingdom and the 
dissemination of the spiritual light of Islam. The 25th chapter is 
again a Makkan revelation, which shows, as its name indicates, that 
the distinction between truth and falsehood which the Holy Quran 
was to establish was witnessed in the lives of the Companions of 
the Holy Prophet. 

A group of three more Makkan chapters (26th to 28th), the Ta 
Sz~w_group, is then introduced, prophesying the ultimate triumph of 
the Holy Prophet with special reference to the triumph of Moses 
over a powerful enemy who was bent upon destroying the Israel- 
ites. Another group of four Makkan chapters (29th to 32nd), the 
AlifLam Mim group, follows and shows that the state of helpless- 
ness and utter weakness in which the Muslims were at the time 
would soon be changed. A Madinan chapter, the 33rd, is again 
inserted showing how the combined forces of the enemies of 
Islam in the Battle of the Allies failed to crush Islam. The utmost 
simplicity of the Holy Prophet's domestic life is here brought in to 
show that the attractions of this world, such as wealth or kingdom, 
had no charm for him, despite the fact that he then ruled Arabia, 
and that he was to be a model for all nations and for all ages, no 
prophet being needed after him, and emphasizing that it was only 
shortsighted critics who found fault with a man who led a life of 
such unexampled purity and simplicity. A group of six Makkan 
chapters follows (34th to 39th), showing that the rise and fall of 
nations are brought about by the good and evil they do, and that 
nations which rise to greatness can retain their eminent position 
only if they are not ungrateful for the favours conferred upon 
them. 



A SUMMARY OF THE HOLY QURAN 1-63 

The next group of seven Makkan chapters (40 to 46) is known 
as the Ha Mim group, and it lays stress on the fact that Truth must 
overcome opposition and that no temporal power with all the 
material resources at its back can annihilate Truth. This is followed 
by a group of three Madinan chapters: the 47th, which was revealed 
in 1 A.H., showing that those who had accepted the truth as 
revealed to the Holy Prophet, though in great distress, would soon 
have their condition ameliorated; the 48th, which belongs to 6 A.H., 
predicting in the clearest words the final triumph of Islam over all 
the religions of the world; and the last of this group, ch. 49, which 
was revealed towards the close of the Holy Prophet's life, enjoin- 
ing on the Muslims the duty of respect for one another. 

From the 50th to the 56th, is another group of seven Makkan 
chapters pointing out the great spiritual awakening which was to 
be brought about by the Holy Quran. Then comes the last group of 
Madinan revelations, ten chapters in all, from the 57th to the 66th, 
which supplement what has already been said in the previous 
Madinan chapters, the last two of these, the 65th and 66th, being 
clearly a supplement to the second chapter, al-Baqarah, and deal- 
ing with the subject of divorce and temporary separation. 

Then follow 48 short Makkan chapters, showing how people 
and nations can rise to eminence by following the Truth which is 
revealed in the Holy Quran, and how they suffer loss by rejecting 
the Truth. The Holy Book ends with a concise but clear declaration 
of Divine Unity, in chapter 1 12; the last two chapters show how to 
seek refuge in Divine protection against all kinds of mischief. 



Key 

It is sometimes necessary to know whether the words "you" 
and "your" in the translation (when not referring to God) occur in 
the singular or plural in the Arabic text. To indicate the singular case 
in this translation, the initial letter "y" is set in italic font, like this: 
you. For example, in 2:4 in the words "revealed to you", the word 
"you" is in the singular, referring to the Holy Prophet Muhammad, 
while in 4:140 in the words "revealed to you" the word "you" is 
plural, referring to all Muslims. Note that whenever God is 
addressed, it is always in the singular in the Arabic text of the 
Quran, and in those cases in this translation the letter "y" has been 
capitalised, as in "You" and "Your". 

Footnotes: Footnote numbering on each page starts afresh 
from a. In each footnote, the footnote mark (a, b, c, etc.) is 
followed in parentheses by the number of the verse that it refers 
to; for example: b (1). When two or more footnotes refer to the 
same verse, the verse number is followed by a dash and a serial 
number (-1, -2, etc.); for example: a (3-1) and b (3-2). 

Transliteration: Common words are not transliterated, such as 
Islam, Quran, Allah, Muhammad, Hadith (which would be: Islam, 
Qur'an, Allah, Muhammad, Hadith). Some names are trans- 
literated only to the extent of placing the 'bar' over the letters a, i, 
or u, to indicate that the vowel is long, as a guide to pronunciation. 
Full transliteration marks are only used when the exact form of a 
word or phrase in Arabic needs to be represented, and in all such 
cases that text is printed in italics. For all words that are not fully 
transliterated, the full transliteration has provided on the page 
entitled Transliterated Forms at the end of the Index. 

Sections: The marking of sections (each called a ruku ') within 
the longer chapters of the Quran is only found in certain parts of 
the Muslim world, such as the Indian subcontinent. The section 
headings given in this work (following Maulana Muhammad Ali's 
original translation) are inserted by the translator, and are not found 
in the Quran itself.

Chapter 1 
Ai-Fatihah The Opening 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful." 

1 Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, 

2 The Beneficent, the Merciful, 

3 Master of the day of Recompense/ 

4 You do we serve and You do we beseech for help. 

5 Guide us on the right path, e 

6 The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favours, 

7 Not those upon whom wrath is brought down, nor those who 
go astray/ 



Introduction 

Al-Fatihah or The Opening is the quintessence of the whole of the Holy Quran. 
It formed an essential part of the Muslim prayers from the earliest days of 
Islam. The chapter is headed by the words Bi-smillah-ir-Rahman-ir-RahTm 
("In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful"), which also head every 
other chapter of the Quran except the ninth. The first three verses speak of 
the four chief Divine attributes, namely, providence, beneficence, mercy and 
requital, and the last three lay open before the Great Maker the earnest desire 
of man's soul to walk in righteousness, without stumbling on either side, 
while the middle verse is expressive of man's entire dependence on Allah. 
These Divine attributes disclose Allah's all-encompassing beneficence and 
care, and His unbounded love for all of His creatures, and the ideal to which 
the soul is made to aspire is the path of righteousness, the path of grace, and 
the path in which there is no stumbling. 

Notes 

a. The phrase is equivalent to: I seek the assistance of Allah, the Beneficent, 
the Merciful. The word Allah is a proper name applied to the Being Who exists 
necessarily by Himself, comprising all the attributes of perfection. 

Rahman ("Beneficent") and Rahim ("Merciful") both signify tenderness 
requiring the exercise of beneficence, the former indicating the greatest prepond- 
erance of the quality of mercy, and the latter being expressive of a constant 
repetition and manifestation of the attribute. Ar-Rahman is the Beneficent God 



1. THE OPENING • Ch. 1 



Whose love and mercy are manifested in the creation of this world, and ar-Rahim 
is the Merciful God Whose love and mercy are manifested in the state that comes 
after, in the consequences of people's deeds. Thus the former is expressive of the 
utmost degree of love and generosity, and includes both the believer and the 
unbeliever for its objects, while the latter is expressive of unbounded and constant 
favour and mercy, and relates specially to the believer. 

b (1) Rabb ("Lord") is the Author of all existence Who has not only given to 
the whole creation its means of nourishment but has also beforehand ordained for 
each a sphere of capacity and within that sphere provided the means by which it 
continues to attain gradually to its goal of perfection. There is no single word in 
English carrying the significance of the word Rabb — Nourisher to perfection 
would be nearest. Thus the very first words of the Quran — Praise be to Allah, 
the Lord of the worlds — are in consonance with the cosmopolitan nature of the 
religion of Islam, which requires belief in prophets of all nations. 

c (3) The adoption of the word master is to show that Allah can forgive His 
servants, because He is not a mere king or a mere judge, but more properly a 
Master. The word yaum ("day") is applied in the Holy Quran to any period of 
time, from a moment (55:29) to fifty thousand years (70:4), and may therefore 
indicate an indefinitely small or indefinitely large amount of time. In describing 
God as Master of the day of Recompense, the Holy Quran lays stress, on the one 
hand, on the fact that the Divine law of recompense of deeds is working every 
moment, and thus makes man feel the responsibility of what he does, and gives 
prominence, on the other, to the quality of forgiveness in Divine nature as God's 
dealing with man is like that of a Master Who is essentially merciful. 

d (4) Here the way is pointed out through which man can attain to real great- 
ness. It is through 'ibadat (service) of God which means obedience combined with 
complete humility, and through seeking help from God. The idea of 'ibadat in 
Islam is not a mere declaration of the glory of God, but the imbibing of Divine 
morals and receiving their impress through humble service to God. 

e (5) Hidayat (guidance) means not only showing the way but also leading 
one on the right way till one reaches the goal. 

/(6) Those upon whom favours are bestowed are the four classes mentioned 
in 4:69, namely, the prophets, the truthful, the faithful and the righteous. It is in 
the footsteps of these spiritual leaders of the world that the Muslim aspires to 
walk, the chief aim of his life thus being not only his own spiritual perfection but 
to try also for the spiritual perfection of others. 

g (7) Muslims are warned here that even after receiving Divine favours they 
may incur Divine displeasure and go astray from the path which leads to the goal 
of perfection. The Jews provide an example of a people failing in righteous deeds, 
failing to carry out the spirit of the doctrine while retaining the doctrine, and the 
Christians an example of a people corrupting the doctrine itself. The Muslims are 
thus taught a prayer that they may neither fail in good deeds while retaining the 
letter of the law, nor corrupt the doctrine, and that they may be kept on the middle 
path, avoiding either extreme. 



Chapter 2 

Al-Baqarah The COW 

The name of this chapter is taken from the story in verses 67-7 1 regarding the 
slaughter of a cow, cow-worship having taken a hold among the Jews. This 
chapter deals mainly with the Israelites and their contentions against Islam, 
and hence much of the legislation, details of which necessarily differ from 
the Jewish law, is dealt with in this chapter. The last chapter contains a prayer 
for being guided on the right path (1:5), and here that guidance is afforded in 
the opening words: "This book, in which there is no doubt, is a guide" (v. 2). 

The chapter deals with: the fundamental principles of Islam, need for 
Divine revelation, history of the Israelite nation, the replacement of former 
scriptures by the Quran, the covenant with Abraham, Islamic teachings on 
various important matters (including fasting, pilgrimage, wars, marriage and 
divorce), the power of Allah to give life to dead nations, and the need to 
sacrifice wealth in the cause of Truth. It ends with a prayer for the ultimate 
triumph of truth. This chapter was revealed at Madinah, mostly in the years 1 
and 2 A.H. 



Section 1 : Fundamental Principles of Islam

a (1) This verse consists of the letters alif, lam, mim. The combinations of 
letters or single letters occurring at the commencement of several chapters of the 
Quran are, according to the best received opinion, abbreviations standing for words. 
Translations of the Holy Quran generally leave these abbreviations untranslated. 
The alif, lam, mim, occuring here as well as at the commencement of five other 
chapters are interpreted by some early authorities as meaning "I, Allah, am the 
best Knower", alif standing for ana, lam for Allah, and mim for a 'lam, being 
respectively the first, the middle and the last letters of the words for which they 
stand. Others regard them as contractions for some Divine attribute. 

b (2) The application of the word "book" (kitab) to the Holy Quran occurs in 
very early revelations, and shows clearly that the Quran was from the first meant 
to be a complete book that existed not only in the memory of people but also in

in the Unseen a and keep up prayer and spend (on good works) out 
of what We have given them,* 4 and who believe in what has been 
revealed to you and what was revealed before you, c and of the 
Hereafter d they are sure. 5 These are on a right course from their 
Lord and these it is that are successful. 

6 Those who disbelieve — to whom it is the same whether 
you warn them or do not warn them 6 — they will not believe. 
7 Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing; and there is a 
covering on their eyes, and for them is a grievous punishment/ 

writing. The Quran is here described as affording guidance to those who keep 
their duty, because the sense of keeping his duty is innate in man. No guidance 
would benefit those who have no regard for their duty. 

a (3-1) The Unseen here stands for Allah, a belief in Whose existence is the 
cardinal principle of religion. 

b (3-2) In Islam prayer assumed a regularity and a form. However, it is not 
the mere observance of the form that the Quran requires, but the keeping of it in a 
right state, i.e. being true to the spirit of the prayer. Spending out of what one has 
been given stands for charity in its broadest sense, or the doing of good to all 
creatures. This verse lays down the two prime duties which are necessary for 
spiritual advancement: prayer to God and service to humanity. 

c (4-1) Islam requires faith in all the prophets of the world and the 
recognition of truth in all religions. The words what was revealed before you 
(O Prophet) include revelations to all the nations of the world, for we are else- 
where told that "there is not a people but a warner has gone among them" (35:24). 
A Muslim is therefore one who believes in all the prophets of God, sent to any 
nation, whether their names are mentioned in the Holy Quran or not. 

d (4-2) A life after death, according to Islam, implies a state of existence 
which begins with death, but a complete manifestation of which takes place later, 
when the fruits of the actions done in this life take their final shape. A belief in 
God and a belief in the Hereafter, being respectively the first and the last of the 
fundamental principles of Islam as mentioned here, often stand for a belief in all 
the fundamental principles of Islam, as in 2:8, 2:62, etc. 

e (6) The passage is parenthetical, meaning that disbelievers of a particular 
type, i.e., those who pay no heed at all to the Holy Prophet's warning, cannot 
benefit by his preaching. 

f(J) Only those disbelievers are spoken of here who so hardened their hearts 
as not to pay any heed to the Prophet's preaching and warning, as clearly indi- 
cated in the previous verse; compare 7:179: "They have hearts with which they do 
not understand, and they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears 
with which they do not hear. They are as cattle." Allah is here spoken of as having 



2:8« LIP-PROFESSION 



Section 2: Lip-profession 

8 And there are some people who say: We believe in Allah 
and the Last Day; and they are not believers." 'They seek to 
deceive Allah and those who believe, and they deceive only them- 
selves and they do not perceive. 10 In their hearts is a disease, so 
Allah increased their disease, 6 and for them is a painful punish- 
ment because they lie. n And when it is said to them, Do not make 
mischief in the land, they say: We are only peacemakers. 12 Now 
surely they are the mischief-makers, but they do not perceive. 
13 And when it is said to them, Believe as the people believe, they 
say: Shall we believe as the fools believe? Now surely they are the 
fools, but they do not know. 

14 And when they meet those who believe, they say, We 
believe; and when they are alone with their devils, e they say: 
Surely we are with you, we were only mocking. 15 AUah will pay 
them back their mockery, and He leaves them alone in their 
inordinacy, blindly wandering on. 16 These are they who buy error 
for guidance, so their bargain brings no gain, nor are they guided. 

17 Their parable is as the parable of one who kindles a fire, 
but when it illumines all around him, Allah takes away their light, 
and leaves them in darkness 8 — they cannot see. 18 Deaf, dumb, 



sealed their hearts and ears because He made them taste the consequences of their 
heedlessness. 

a (8) Belief in Allah and the Last Day is here equivalent to the profession of 
Islam. After speaking of the accepters and the rejecters of the Holy Prophet's 
message, the Quran now speaks of the insincere people who accept the message 
only with their lips. The persons spoken of in this verse are the hypocrites, who 
were a source of constant trouble to the Holy Prophet at Madinah. 

b (10) In 71:6 Noah is made to say: "But my call has only made them flee 
the more", though the call was meant to bring them nearer to the truth. The disease 
here stands for the weakness of their hearts, for they had not the courage to deny 
Islam openly, and this weakness only became the greater as the cause of Islam 
became more and more triumphant. 

c (14) By their devils are meant their evil companions, as stated in 2:76. 

d (15) God will requite them with punishment according to their mockery. 

e (17) The kindler of the fire is the Holy Prophet Muhammad, who kindled

(and) blind, so they do not return (to the right way), 19 or like abun- 
dant rain from the cloud in which is darkness, and thunder and 
lightning; they put their fingers into their ears because of the 
thunder-peal, for fear of death. And Allah encompasses the 
disbelievers. 20 The lightning almost takes away their sight. 
Whenever it shines on them they walk in it, and when it becomes 
dark to them they stand still. a And if Allah had pleased, He would 
have taken away their hearing and their sight. Surely Allah is 
Powerful over all things. 

Section 3: Divine Unity 

21 O people, serve your Lord Who created you and those 
before you, so that you may guard against evil, 22 Who made the 
earth a resting-place for you and the heaven a structure, and sends 
down rain from the clouds then brings forth with it fruits for your 
sustenance; so do not set up rivals to Allah while you know. 23 And 
if you are in doubt as to that which We have revealed to Our 
servant, then produce a chapter like it and call on your helpers 
besides Allah if you are truthful. ° 24 But if you do not (do it) — 

the torch of light. The light of their eyes, which alone could make them take 
advantage of the light which was lit up by the Prophet, was taken away. The act of 
taking away the light is attributed to Allah, as the remote cause. 

a (20) When difficulties and distresses befell the Muslims — when it 
became dark — the hypocrites and the weak-hearted stood still. They refused to 
keep company with the Muslims in the battles which the latter had to fight. When 
there was a flash of lightning, and a success followed — a success so great that it 
almost blinded them — they would walk on a little and seem to be keeping com- 
pany with the Muslims. 

b (22) Attention is thus drawn to the oneness of humanity, as if it were a 
single family living in one resting-place under one roof. 

c (23) A similar challenge is contained in 10:38. See also 11:13. In 17:88 the 
whole of mankind are declared to be unable to produce a book like the Quran. 
While the Quran is undoubtedly a unique production of Arabic literature, its chief 
characteristic, in which no other book can claim equality with it, is the wonderful, 
unparalleled transformation which it accomplished. Its injunctions swept off the 
most deep-rooted evils and made an ignorant people the foremost torchbearers of 
knowledge and science, and masters of the greatest empire of the world. Besides, 
every word of the Quran gives expression to Divine majesty and glory in a manner 
which is not approached by any other sacred book.

and you can never do (it) — then be on your guard against the 
fire whose fuel is people and stones;" it is prepared for the 
disbelievers. 

25 And give good news to those who believe and do good 
deeds, that for them are Gardens in which rivers flow. Whenever 
they are given a portion of the fruit of these (Gardens), they will 
say: This is what was given to us before; and they are given the 
like of it. c And they will have therein pure companions and 
therein they will abide. 

26 Surely Allah does not disdain to set forth any parable — a 
gnat or anything above that. 6 Then as for those who believe, they 
know that it is the truth from their Lord; and as for those who 
disbelieve, they say: What is it that Allah means by this parable? 



a (24) The reference in "stones" may be to the leaders, called "helpers" in 
the previous verse, while "people" would stand for the common people. 

b (25-1) The description of paradise as given in the Holy Quran is expressly 
stated to be a parable; see 13:35, 47:15. The righteous are spoken of as having 
gardens in the next life to show that they have made the seed of faith to grow into 
extensive gardens, and this is in reference to the vast development of their inner 
self or of the faculties which God has given them. The rivers represent the good 
deeds which are necessary to the growth of the seed. The fruits of the life after 
death are the consequences of the deeds done in this life. 

c (25-2) Whenever the faithful are made to taste of a portion of the fruits of 
their good deeds in the life to come, they will find those fruits much resembling 
the fruits which they tasted spiritually in this life. The like of it may signify that 
the fruits of their deeds will be similar to those deeds. 

d (25-3) The pure companions may be the believing wives of the faithful, as 
elsewhere we have: "They and their wives are in shades, reclining on raised 
couches" (36:56). But more probably these are among the blessings of the 
heavenly life to which men and women are equally entitled. All the blessings of 
heavenly life are, according to a saying of the Holy Prophet, "things which no eye 
has seen and no ear has heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to con- 
ceive of them" (Bukhari, 59:8). The words in which these blessings are depicted in 
the Holy Quran, therefore, should not be taken literally. 

e (26-1) The parables to which reference is contained in these words are the 
parables speaking of the weakness of the false deities; see 29:41, 22:73. The gnat 
is mentioned here because among the Arabs it is a proverbially weak creature, so 
that to express the utmost degree of weakness they say, weaker than the gnat.

Many He leaves in error by it" and many He leads aright by it. 
And He leaves in error by it only the transgressors, 27 who break 
the covenant of Allah after its confirmation and cut apart what 
Allah has ordered to be joined, and make mischief in the land. 
These it is that are the losers. 

28 How can you deny Allah and you were without life and He 
gave you life? Again, He will cause you to die and again bring 
you to life, then you shall be brought back to Him. c 29 He it is

self to the heaven/ so He made them complete seven heavens; 6 
and He is Knower of all things. 

Section 4: Greatness of Mankind and Need for Revelation 

30 And when your Lord said to the angels, I am going to 
place a ruler in the earth, g they said: Will You place in it such as 



a (26-2) Allah guides people by sending His messengers, and therefore He 
could not be spoken of as leading them astray. When ascribed to God, the word 
adalla used here means He pronounced him to be erring or He left him in error. 

b (27) The covenant of Allah is the evidence of His Unity to which human 
nature bears witness. The confirmation of this covenant is brought about by send- 
ing prophets. Cutting off what Allah has ordered to be joined is the disregard of 
others' rights. 

c (28) The first part of the verse contains an argument of the existence of 
God Who gave life to man, and the second states that death on this earth is not the 
end of life but the beginning of another, an eternal and a far higher life. 

d (29-1) The earth was made after the heavens; see 79:30. 

e (29-2) The word sab 'a, which signifies the number seven, is also used as 
meaning seven or more, several or many. In 65:12 it is affirmed that as there are 
seven heavens so there is a like number of earths, and the seven heavens are 
called the seven ways in 23:17, and in this sense the orbit of a planet may be 
called its heaven. The seven heavens may also be taken to apply to the whole 
starry creation and the reference may in this case be to the magnitudes of the stars. 

/(30-1) Allah's saying to the angels is really the expression of an intention 
which is to be brought into execution. It is not a conversation, or a consultation 
with the angels; it is an expression of the Divine will to those intermediary beings 
who are entrusted by the Divine Being with its execution. The existence of such 
intermediaries has been recognized by the righteous in all ages and all countries.

them to the angels; He said: Tell Me the names of those if you are 
right. 32 They said: Glory be to You! we have no knowledge but 
what You have taught us. Surely You are the Knowing, the Wise. 
33 He said: O Adam, inform them of their names. So when he 
informed them of their names, He said: Did I not say to you that I 
know what is unseen in the heavens and the earth? And I know 
what you manifest and what you hide/

of creation. What is stated here is an allegorical description of the preference of 
man above the whole of the creation on this earth, and then of the election of 
those righteous servants of Allah from among men themselves who lead others 
into the right path. One view is that the word "ruler" (khalifa) here refers to the 
whole of mankind, which is corroborated by the Quran itself in 6:165. 

a (30-3) Being entrusted with such great powers, man could use them rightly 
or wrongly. The whole history of mankind is briefly written in this one verse. 
Man is the greatest killer on this earth but he also turns the gifts of God to the best 
use. To God was known the brighter side of this picture; hence the words, / know 
what you do not know. 

b (31-1) Nowhere in the Holy Quran is it affirmed that Adam was the first 
man or that there was no creation before him. Great Muslim theologians have held 
that there were many Adams — thousands of Adams — before the great ancestor 
of mankind known by this name. Adam, therefore, though it may also be the name 
of a particular man, stands for mankind generally. 

c (31-2) Teaching Adam the names signifies the vast capability of man and 
the superiority of his knowledge to that of the angels. Or, the reference may be to 
the faculty of speech, which is the real source of the excellence of man above the 
whole of creation. 

d (33) "What you hide" refers to those great qualities in man which pre- 
ponderate the evil in him, and which remain hidden until they are made manifest 
through the Divine gift of knowledge. The immense capability of man for pro- 
gress remains hidden, while the evil of shedding blood is manifested in a very 
primary stage in his growth. 

e (34-1) Adam throughout this section stands for man generally; so sub- 
mission is to man generally. Man has a superiority over the angels on account of 
his great gift of knowledge of things, the angels being the controlling powers of

was one of the disbelievers." 35 And We said: O Adam, dwell you 
and your wife in the garden, and eat from it a plentiful (food) 
wherever you wish, and do not approach this tree or you would 
be from among the unjust. e 36 But the devil made them slip from 
it, and caused them to depart from the state in which they were. 
And We said: Go forth, some of you are enemies of others. 8 And 
there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time. 



the forces of nature. By his knowledge man could harness the forces of nature and 
exercise control over them; in other words, the angels submitted to him. 

a (34-2) Iblls and Satan (Arabic: shaitan) refer to one and the same being. 
The word Iblis is used when the evil one's evil is limited to himself, and Satan, 
when his evil affects others besides himself. The angels' submission meant that 
man could control the forces of nature by his knowledge of things. But he himself 
was a part of nature, and he could not conquer his own evil desires. The conquest 
of self needed yet another act of Divine mercy, the sending of Divine Revelation. 
Note that Iblls was not one of the angels. 

b (35-1) The garden spoken of in this verse was on this earth, as it was on 
the earth that man was placed. It was certainly not the paradise to which people go 
after death, and from which they will never be expelled (15:48). The placing in 
the garden signifies leading a life of ease and comfort, as is shown by the words 
that follow: "Eat from it a plentiful food wherever you wish". These may also be 
translated as: Eat from it wherever you wish, having abundance of all things. 

c (35-2) It was the tree of the spiritual death of man, the tree of evil. Compare 
14:24-26, where a good word is likened to "a good tree, whose root is firm and 
whose branches are high, yielding its fruit in every season", and an evil word is 
likened to "an evil tree pulled up from the earth's surface; it has no stability". The 
order to eat from the earth a plentiful food but not to approach evil is really a des- 
cription of what pure human nature is. Man is entitled to all the benefits of nature 
to maintain the body so long as he does not forget his soul. 

rf(36-l) The words mean that the devil made them commit a fault uninten- 
tionally. The result was that they were made to depart from the happy condition in 
which they were. The Quran contradicts the Bible: it was not the serpent that 
misled Eve, nor did Eve mislead Adam. The devil cast an evil suggestion into the 
minds of both Adam and Eve, as he casts evil suggestions into the mind of every 
son and daughter of Adam and Eve. 

e (36-2) The new condition in which man finds himself by submitting to his 
low desires is the condition of the mutual enmity of one to the other, the tyranny 
of man to man being undoubtedly the greatest evil which man can commit. The 
use of the words "some of you are enemies of others" shows clearly that this address 
is to all mankind. 



2:37" ISRAELITE PROPHECIES FULFILLED 1 1 

37 Then Adam received (revealed) words from his Lord, and 
He turned to him (mercifully). Surely He is Oft-returning (to 
mercy), the Merciful." 38 We said: Go forth from this (state) all. 
Surely a guidance from Me will come to you, then whoever 
follows My guidance, no fear shall come upon them, nor shall 
they grieve. 6 39 And (as to) those who disbelieve in and reject Our 
messages, they are the companions of the Fire; in it they will 
abide.' 

Section 5: Israelite Prophecies fulfilled in the Quran 

40 O Children of Israel, call to mind My favour which I 
bestowed on you and be faithful to (your) covenant with Me, 
I shall fulfil (My) covenant with you; and Me, Me alone, should 
you fear. 41 And believe in what I have revealed, verifying what 



a (37) Man is found too weak to overcome the evil suggestions of the devil 
or the evil inclinations in him, however strong he may be to conquer the forces of 
nature. So God comes to his help and reveals Himself to him. He sends down 
revelation which, strengthening his faith in God, gives him the strength to over- 
come the devil and reject his suggestions. 

b (38) This is a statement of a general law that Divine Revelation will be 
granted to the whole of humanity and prophets will appear everywhere from time 
to time, and by following the guidance sent by God through His prophets people 
will attain to a state of perfection in which "no fear shall come upon them, nor 
shall they grieve". Those who truly follow the Divine Revelation shall have no 
fear of the devil misleading them, nor shall they grieve at wasting the opportunity 
given them in this life. 

c (39) The people spoken of in this verse are those who not only disbelieve 
but also exert their utmost to oppose revealed truth and uproot it. They keep 
company with evil in this life, so the fire becomes their companion in the next to 
purge them of the evil consequences of their evil deeds. Their hearts burn with 
evil passions in this life, and it is this very fire that assumes a palpable shape in 
the next. Note that the word khalidun ("abide") signifies simply abiding, which 
may be for a long time, and does not necessarily convey the idea of perpetuity. 

d (40) After speaking of the need of Divine Revelation, the Quran now speaks 
of a nation to whom this favour was granted, among whom many prophets were 
raised and who were also made rulers in the earth (see 5:20). The Jewish people 
who are addressed here are generally mentioned as Children of Israel, Israel being 
the other name of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham. For the covenants spoken 
of here, see Deuteronomy 26:17-19. The covenant included the acceptance of the 
revelation to the promised prophet of Deut. 18:18.

is (already) with you, and do not be the first to deny it; nor take a 
small price for My messages;" and keep your duty to Me, Me 
alone. 42 And do not mix up truth with falsehood, nor hide the truth 
while you know. 43 And keep up prayer and give the due charity 
and bow down with those who bow down. 44 Do you tell people to 
be good and neglect your own souls while you read the Book? 
Have you then no sense? 45 And seek assistance through patience 
and prayer, and this is hard except for the humble ones, 46 who 
know that they will meet their Lord and that to Him they will 
return. 

Section 6: Divine Favours on Israel 

47 O Children of Israel, call to mind My favour which I 
bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations/ 48 And 
guard yourselves against a day when no soul will avail another in 
the least, neither will intercession be accepted on its behalf, nor 
will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be helped. 

49 And when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people, who 
subjected you to severe torment, killing your sons and sparing 



a (41) The verification referred to here is clearly the fulfilment of the pro- 
mise contained in Deuteronomy 18:15-18: "The Lord your God will raise up for 
you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brethren. Him you shall 
hear. . . ". No prophet ever claimed to have come in fulfilment of this prophecy 
except the Holy Prophet Muhammad. The religious leaders rejected the truth 
which the Holy Prophet brought, fearing to lose their high position as leaders. 
They thus sacrificed truth to the inducements of this life, and took "a small price" 
for it. 

b (43) These are the two fundamental principles of religion: worship of God 
through prayer to Him, and service of humanity or helping the poor. 

c (47) By "the nations" are meant the people contemporaneous with the 
Israelites in their days of triumph, or large masses of people. Numerous prophets 
were raised among them, and they were made to rule in the earth, and these are 
the favours of which Moses also reminds them (5:20). 

d (48) The Islamic doctrine that the prophets and the righteous will intercede 
for sinners on the day of Judgment really means that if they took as their model a 
righteous servant of God and did their best to follow him, this will shelter them 
from their own weaknesses. See further 2:255 footnote 1 and 4:85 footnote.

your women, and in this there was a great trial from your Lord. 
50 And when We parted the sea for you, so We saved you and 
drowned the people of Pharaoh while you saw." 51 And when We 
appointed a time of forty nights with Moses, then you took the 
calf (for a god) after him, and you were unjust. 4 52 Then We 
pardoned you after that so that you might give thanks. 

53 And when We gave Moses the Book and the criterion that 
you might walk aright. 54 And when Moses said to his people: My 
people, you have surely wronged yourselves by taking the calf 
(for a god), so turn to your Creator (penitently), and kill your 
passions.'' That is best for you with your Creator. So He turned to 
you (mercifully). Surely He is the Oft-returning (to mercy), the 
Merciful. 

55 And when you said: Moses, we will not believe in you till 
we see Allah manifestly, so the punishment overtook you while 
you looked on. e 56 Then We raised you up after your stupor that 
you might give thanks. 57 And We made the clouds to give shade 



a (50) The Quran does not say how the Israelites were made to pass through 
the sea or in what manner the parting of the sea was brought about. One expla- 
nation is that the Israelites passed when the sea receded on account of the ebb, and 
the Egyptians were drowned because the tide was on at the time, and in their zeal 
to overtake the Israelites they did not care for it. 

b (51) While the making of the calf is attributed to Aaron in the Bible, the 
Holy Quran declares that prophet to be innocent in the matter. 

c (53) Furqdn ('criterion', 'distinction') is anything that makes a distinction 
between truth and falsity, and hence it signifies a proof or demonstration and also 
aid or victory. In the sense of distinction, the furqdn given to Moses was Pharaoh's 
drowning in the sea and the deliverance of the Israelites. In the case of the Holy 
Prophet the battle of Badr afforded the furqdn or distinction, and hence the battle 
of Badr is called yaum al-furqdn or the day of distinction in 8:41. 

d (54) The Holy Quran rejects the Bible story of the Israelites being killed as 
a punishment for calf-worship. They were pardoned and were told simply to 
repent, and God accepted their repentance as clearly stated here. Therefore 
anfusa-kum does not mean here your people, but your desires or your passions. 
No prophet ever taught that a man can be killed for the worship of an object other 
than God. 

e (55) See Exodus 19:16-17.

things that We have given you. And they did Us no harm, but they 
wronged their own souls. 

58 And when We said: Enter this city, then eat from it a 
plentiful (food) wherever you wish, and enter the gate submissively, 
and make petition for forgiveness. We will forgive you your 
wrongs and increase the reward of those who do good (to others). 
59 But those who were unjust changed the word which had been 
spoken to them, for another saying," so We sent upon the wrong- 
doers a pestilence from heaven because they transgressed. 

Section 7: Divine Favours on Israel 

60 And when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said: 
March on to the rock with your staff. e So twelve springs flowed 
from it. Each tribe knew their drinking-place. Eat and drink of the 
provisions of Allah, and do not act corruptly, making mischief in 
the land. 61 And when you said: Moses, we cannot endure one 
food, so pray your Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of 
what the earth grows, of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic 
and its lentils and its onions. He said: Would you exchange what 



a (59-1) That is to say, they went against the Divine commandment. 

b (59-2) When a punishment overtakes a people as a consequence of their 
wicked deeds it is spoken of as coming from heaven, the significance probably 
being that it cannot be averted. The pestilence spoken of here is referred to in the 
Bible in Numbers 25:8-9, according to which 24,000 men died of the plague. 

c (60) The words may mean strike the rock with your staff or march on to the 
mountain with your staff ox your community. The story that Moses carried a stone 
with him and that twelve springs flowed from it whenever, placing it in the 
wilderness, he struck it with his staff, has no foundation in the words of the Holy 
Quran or any saying of the Holy Prophet. What the words of the Quran signify is 
either that Moses was commanded by God to strike a particular rock with his staff 
from which water flowed forth miraculously, or to march on to a mountain from 
which springs flowed. 

d (61-1) The Israelites were required to live a hard life which would make 
them fit for conquering the Holy Land; this was better for them. But they wanted 
to live a life of ease and to have all kinds of food which they could get only by 
settling in towns and tilling the land.

is better for what is worse? Enter a city, so you will have what you 
ask for. And degradation and humiliation were stamped upon them, 
and they incurred Allah's wrath." That was so because they dis- 
believed in the messages of Allah and would kill the prophets 
unjustly. That was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the 
limits. 

Section 8: Israelites' Degeneration 

62 Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the 
Christians, and the Sabians, 6 whoever believes in Allah and the 
Last Day and does good, they have their reward with their Lord, 
and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve. c 

63 And when We made a covenant with you and raised the 
mountain above you: Hold on firmly what We have given you, 
and bear in mind what is in it, so that you may guard against evil. 
64 Then after that you turned back; and if it had not been for the 
grace of Allah and His mercy on you, you would certainly have 



a (61-2) The verse speaks of the ultimate condition to which the Israelites 
were reduced when they persisted in setting at naught the Divine commandments 
and indulged in immoral and depraved practices. 

b (62-1) The commentators hold different opinions regarding Sabians, most 
of them agreeing that they are representatives of a religion between Judaism and 
Christianity, based on the doctrine of unity, but also maintaining worship of 
angels. 

c (62-2) This verse strikes at the root of the idea of a favoured nation whose 
members alone may be entitled to salvation. The subject is introduced here to 
show that even the Jews, despite their transgressions which had made them deser- 
ving of Divine wrath, were entitled to a goodly reward if they believed and did 
good deeds. The statement made here is that salvation cannot be attained by mere 
lip-profession by any people, not even by the Muslims, unless they adhere to a 
true belief and do good deeds. The existence of good people in other religions is 
not denied by the Holy Quran, but perfect peace, or the state of absolute content- 
ment which is indicated by freedom from fear and grief, is obtainable only in 
Islam, because it alone is the religion of absolute submission to the Divine Being. 

d (63) There is nothing in the words of the Quran to support the baseless 
story that the mountain was suspended in the air over the heads of the Israelites to 
frighten them into submission. The use of the word raf ("raised") is in accord- 
ance with the Arabic idiom, for it signifies the making high or lofty of a building.

been among the losers. 65 And indeed you know those among you 
who violated the Sabbath," so We said to them: Be (as) apes, despised 
and hated. 66 So We made them an example to those who wit- 
nessed it and those who came after it and an admonition to those 
who guard against evil. 

67 And when Moses said to his people: Allah commands you 
to sacrifice a cow. c They said: Do you ridicule us? He said: I seek 
refuge with Allah from being one of the ignorant. 68 They said: 
Call on jour Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what she is. 
(Moses) said: He says, Surely she is a cow neither advanced in 
age nor too young, of middle age between these (two); so do what 
you are commanded. 69 They said: Call on your Lord for our sake 
to make it clear to us what her colour is. (Moses) said: He says, 
She is a yellow cow; her colour is intensely yellow delighting the 
onlookers. 70 They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it 
clear to us what she is, for surely to us cows are all alike, and if 
Allah please we shall surely be guided aright. 71 (Moses) said: He 
says: She is a cow not made submissive to plough the land, nor 
does she water the crops, sound, without a blemish in her. They 
said: Now you have brought the truth. So they slaughtered her, 
though they were not inclined to do (it). 



a (65-1) There is no Sabbath among the Muslims because in Islam no 
particular day is set apart for Divine worship. On the other hand, the Muslim is 
required to pray in the very midst of his everyday work, and even the Jumu 'ah 
(Friday) prayers are no exception, for the Quran expressly allows the doing of 
work both before and after the Jumu 'ah prayers. 

b (65-2) An early commentator, Mujahid, gives the following explanation: 
"They were not transformed or metamorphosed; it is only a parable which Allah 
has set forth for them, the like of what He has set forth in likening them to asses 
(62:5), i.e., their hearts were transformed, not that they were metamorphosed into 
apes." 

c (67) As the Israelites held the cow in great honour, and even worshipped it, 
as is clear from their worship of the golden calf, they were ordered to slaughter 
such cows as were usually let loose to wander and worshipped as sacred objects, 
the aim being to root out cow-worship from among them. 



2 : 72 • THEY GROW IN HARD-HEARTEDNESS 17 

Section 9: They grow in Hard-heartedness 

72 And when you (almost) killed a man," then you disagreed 
about it. And Allah was to bring forth what you were going to 
hide. 73 So We said: Strike him with it partially. Thus Allah brings 
the dead to life, c and He shows you His signs that you may under- 
stand. 74 Then your hearts hardened after that, so that they were 
like rocks, rather worse in hardness. And surely there are some 
rocks from which streams burst forth; and there are some of them 
which split apart so water flows from them; and there are some of 
them which fall down for the fear of Allah. And Allah is not 
heedless of what you do. 

75 Do you then hope that they would believe in you, and 
some of them indeed used to hear the word of Allah, then altered 
it after they had understood it, and they know (this). 6 76 And when 
they meet those who believe they say, We believe, and when they 
are apart with one another they say: Do you talk to them of what 
Allah has disclosed to you that they may contend with you by this 
before your Lord? Do you not understand? 77 Do they not know 



a (72-1) This incident refers to Jesus, as it was with respect to his death that 
disagreement took place and many doubted his death. Compare the incidents 
narrated here with the same incidents as narrated in 4:153-157. The words you 
killed are used because the Jews asserted that they had killed him, and because 
metaphorically a person may be said to have been killed when he is made to 
appear as if he were dead. 

b (72-2) The Jews wanted to kill Jesus, but God ordained that he should not 
die. This was the bringing forth of what they were going to hide. 

c (73) The act of murder was not completed in the case of Jesus, as the 
Gospels show, for after he was taken down from the cross his legs were not 
broken, as in the case of the thieves. This was really a case of giving life to the 
dead, for Jesus Christ was dead to all appearance. Those actually dead do not 
return to life in this world; see 21:95, 23:100 and 39:42. 

rf(74) Even hardened hearts would receive life — even more, they would 
give life to others, be a source of spiritual life for others as water and streams are 
sources of life in the physical world. 

e (75) That the Israelites did not preserve their sacred books in their purity is 
a constant charge laid by the Holy Quran against the Jews. In fact, the alteration 
and corruption of the various books of the Bible is now proved beyond all doubt. 



18 2. THE COW «2:78 

that Allah knows what they keep secret and what they make known? 
78 And some of them are illiterate; they do not know the Book except 
(from) hearsay, and they only conjecture. 

79 Woe, then, to those who write the Book with their hands 
then say, This is from Allah; so that they may take for it a small 
price. So woe to them for what their hands write and woe to them 
for what they earn. 80 And they say: Fire will not touch us but for a 
few days. Say: Have you received a promise from Allah? Then 
Allah will not fail to perform His promise. Or do you speak 
against Allah what you do not know? 81 Indeed, whoever earns evil 
and his sins beset him on every side, those are the companions of 
the Fire; in it they abide.' 82 And those who believe and do good 
deeds, these are the owners of the Garden; in it they abide. e 



a (78) The Jewish masses had no access to their own sacred books which 
were known only to their learned men, and therefore their religious ideas were 
based only on stories which they knew from hearsay. The same is to a very large 
extent true of the Muslims of our day. In the early days of Islam, every individual 
Muslim, man as well as woman, sought light direct from the Quran. Not so the 
Muslims in this age who depend entirely on their learned men. They do read the 
Quran but look upon mere recitation as a meritorious deed without trying to learn 
what it says, and then act upon it. 

b (81) The inmates of the Fire are here stated to be those who earn evil, and 
find themselves beset on every side by their evil deeds. These are the people who 
give themselves up to evil, and who therefore ultimately find themselves in the 
power of evil, which even in this life, but more palpably in the life after death, 
assumes the form of a burning fire. It should be noted that the one who struggles 
against evil, however long that struggle may take, to overcome an evil inclination, 
is not the one who earns evil, because the earnest struggle in which the fighter 
against evil hates and detests evil, and seeks to overcome it, always ends in a vic- 
tory for the good and noble qualities in human beings. 

c (82) The doers of good are called ashab al-Jannah or owners of the 
Garden. The word ashab is plural of sahib which means a companion or an 
owner. I have translated ashab an-nar as companions of the Fire but ashab al- 
Jannah as owners of the Garden, because while the inmates of the Fire will be 
taken out of it after being purged of the evil, of paradise it is said that it is "a gift 
never to be cut off" (11:108), and that those in it will never be ejected from it 
(15:48). 



2:83' THEIR COVENANT AND ITS VIOLATION 1 9 

Section 10: Their Covenant and its Violation 

83 And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel:" 
You shall serve none but Allah. And do good to (your) parents, 
and to the near of kin and to orphans and the needy, and speak 
good (words) to (all) people,* and keep up prayer and give the due 
charity. c Then you turned back except a few of you, and you are 
averse. 84 And when We made a covenant with you: You shall not 
shed your blood, nor turn your people out of your cities; then you 
promised and you bear witness. 85 Yet you it is who would kill 
your people and turn some of you out of their homes, backing 
each other up against them unlawfully and exceeding the limits. 
And if they should come to you as captives you would ransom 
them, whereas their turning out itself was unlawful for you. Do 
you then believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in the 
other? e What then is the reward of such among you as do this but 



a (83-1) Allah's making a covenant with a people signifies His giving 
commandments to them. 

b (83-2) The word qaul (speaking) is used to express all kinds of deeds, and 
hence the speaking of good words to all stands for kind dealing with all. 

c (83-3) Prayer and zakat ("due charity") as enjoined on the Israelites 
differed from the Islamic prayer and zakat in details. The directions regarding tithe 
among the Israelites are contained in Deuteronomy 14:28-29. 

d (84) The previous verse speaks of a covenant with the Children of Israel 
while this one speaks of a covenant with you. The reference here is to the impor- 
tant treaty of mutual obligation in writing which the Holy Prophet entered into 
with the Jews when he settled at Madinah. By this treaty the Muslims and the Jews 
were bound not only not to turn their hands against each other but also to defend 
one another against a common enemy. 

e (85) The reference is to the terms of the original treaty under which the 
Jews were bound to ransom the Muslims if they were made captives by an enemy. 
They did not openly repudiate the treaty but intrigued with the enemy to turn the 
Muslims out of Madinah. The reference in believing in a part of the book and 
disbelieving in the other is to this conduct of the Jews. Most commentators, 
however, understand that the reference here is to the alliance which the two 
Jewish tribes, Quraizah and Nadir, living side by side at Madinah, had made with 
Aus and Khazraj, the two rival tribes of Madinah respectively. When the latter 
fought against each other, their allies took part in the fighting, and thus one 
Jewish tribe slaughtered and imprisoned the other and laid waste their habitations,

disgrace in the life of this world, and on the day of Resurrection 
they shall be sent back to the most grievous punishment. And Allah 
is not heedless of what you do. 86 These are they who buy the life 
of this world for the Hereafter, so their punishment shall not be 
lightened, nor shall they be helped. 

Section 1 1 : They reject the Prophet 

87 And We indeed gave Moses the Book and We sent 
messengers after him one after another; and We gave Jesus, son of 
Mary, clear arguments and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit." 
Is it then that whenever a messenger came to you with what your 
souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And some you rejected 
and others you would kill. 88 And they say: Our hearts are securely 
covered. No, Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief; c 
so it is little that they believe. 89 And when a Book from Allah 
came to them verifying what they (already) have, and before this 
they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved — 

but afterwards collected subscriptions for the release of the Jewish prisoners, on 
the ground that the law commanded them to redeem the prisoners and they fought 
against their co-religionists for the honour of their allies. 

a (87) Generally the epithet "son of Mary" is added to Jesus' name to show 
that he was a mortal like other prophets of God. The long chain of prophets that 
came after Moses ended in Jesus, Moses being the first and Jesus the last prophet 
of the Israelite dispensation. The idea of the Holy Ghost as met with in Christian 
religious literature is quite different from and opposed to the Jewish conception of 
the Holy Spirit which Islam accepts. The Holy Spirit is the angel which brought 
revelation: "The Holy Spirit has revealed it (i.e. the Quran) from your Lord" 
(16:102). Jesus' being strengthened with the Holy Spirit only means that he was 
granted Divine revelation like other prophets before him. 

b (88-1) The meaning is either that they said that their hearts were so full of 
knowledge already that they stood in no need of any further knowledge, or that 
their hearts were covered from hearing and accepting what the Prophet said. 

c (88-2) The allegation of the Israelites was that, being descendants of pro- 
phets, their hearts were the repositories of knowledge, and being already, as it 
were, full of knowledge, they did not stand in need of more. They are told that it 
was really their disbelief which became the cause of their estrangement from the 
good which the Holy Prophet had brought. 

d (89) The Jews expected that when the Prophet spoken of in Deuteronomy

but when that which they recognized came to them, they dis- 
believed in it; so Allah's curse is on the disbelievers. 90 Evil is 
what they sell their souls for — that they should deny what Allah 
has revealed, out of envy that Allah should send down of His 
grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases; so they incur 
wrath upon wrath. And there is a humiliating punishment for the 
disbelievers. 

91 And when it is said to them, Believe in what Allah has 
revealed, they say: We believe in what was revealed to us. And 
they deny what is besides that, while it is the Truth verifying what 
they (already) have." Say: Why then did you kill Allah's prophets 
before (this) if you were believers? 92 And Moses indeed came to 
you with clear arguments, then you took the calf (for a god) in his 
absence and you were wrongdoers. 93 And when We made a cove- 
nant with you and raised the mountain above you: Take hold of 
what We have given you with firmness and obey. They said: We 
hear and disobey. e And they were made to imbibe (the love of) the 
calf into their hearts on account of their disbelief. Say: Evil is 
what your faith bids you if you are believers. 

94 Say: If the abode of the Hereafter with Allah is specially 
for you to the exclusion of the (other) people, then invoke death if 
you are truthful. 95 And they will never invoke it on account of 
what their hands have already done, and Allah knows the wrong- 
doers. 96 And you will certainly find them the greediest of people 
for life, (greedier) even than those who set up partners (with 
Allah). One of them loves to be granted a life of a thousand years, 
and his being granted a long life will in no way remove him

a (91-1) They asserted that they could accept only a revelation granted to an 
Israelite. The reply to this is that the revelation of the Holy Prophet is the truth 
verifying what is contained in their own scriptures. 

b (91-2) They tried to kill even Israelite prophets, which shows that it was 
their hard-heartedness which prevented them from accepting the truth, whether 
that truth was revealed through an Israelite or a non-Israelite prophet.

expression of their condition.

Section 12: Their Enmity to the Prophet 

97 Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel a — for surely he 
revealed it to jour heart by Allah's command, verifying what is 
(already) before it and a guidance and glad tidings for the 
believers. 98 Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His 
messengers and Gabriel and Michael, then surely Allah is an 
enemy to disbelievers. 

99 And We indeed have revealed to you clear messages, and 
none disbelieve in them except the transgressors. 100 Is it that when- 
ever they make a covenant, some of them cast it aside? No, most 
of them have no faith. 101 And when a messenger from Allah came 
to them verifying what they (already) have, some of those who 
were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs 
as if they knew nothing.' 



102 And they follow what the devils fabricated against the 
kingdom of Solomon. And Solomon did not disbelieve, but the 
devils disbelieved, teaching people enchantment. 6 And it was not 



a (97) The Jews looked upon Gabriel as their enemy because he was con- 
sidered to be an avenging angel who brought down Divine punishment upon the 
guilty. But in the Bible, as in the Holy Quran, Gabriel is mentioned as delivering 
Divine messages to men, as in Daniel 8:16 and in Luke 1:19 and 26. 

b (98) Man's enmity to Allah signifies opposition to His commandments, 
and Allah's enmity to man signifies the recompense for his opposition. Note that 
Allah is here said to be an enemy to those disbelievers only who first make them- 
selves enemies to His prophets, and hence also to the Divine Being Himself. 

c (101) The covenant referred to in v. 100 as being cast aside, and the throw- 
ing of the Book behind their backs, both refer to the Israelites paying no heed to 
the prophecy of Deuteronomy 18:18, which was verified by the advent of the 
Holy Prophet. 

d (102-1) According to an interpretation accepted by all commentators, by 
the devils here are meant human devils, or devils in the form of people. 

e (102-2) The Arabic word sihr ("enchantment") signifies 'the producing of 
what is false in the form of truth', and 'embellishment by falsification and deceit'.

revealed to the two angels in Babel — Harut and Mariit. Nor did 
they teach (it to) anyone, so that they should have said, We are 
only a trial, so do not disbelieve. But they learn from these two 
(sources) that by which they make a distinction between a man 
and his wife. And they cannot hurt with it anyone except with 
Allah's permission. And they learn that which harms them and 
does not benefit them. And certainly they know that he who buys 
it has no share of good in the Hereafter. And surely evil is the 
price for which they have sold their souls; if only they knew! 
i° 3 And if they had believed and kept their duty, reward from Allah 
would certainly have been better; if only they knew! 

Section 13: Previous Scriptures are abrogated 

104 O you who believe, do not say Rd 'i-na and say Unzur-na, 
and listen. And for the disbelievers there is a painful punishment.* 
105 Neither those who disbelieve from among the people of the 
Book, nor the idolaters, like that any good should be sent down to 
you from your Lord. And Allah chooses whom He pleases for His 
mercy; and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace. 106 Whatever message 
We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it 
or one like it. c Do you not know that Allah is Powerful over 



a (102-3) What the Quran says here is that the Jews, instead of following the 
word of God, followed certain evil crafts which they falsely attributed to Solomon 
and to two angels at Babel (Harut and Marat). Solomon is declared free of any 
such sinfulness attributed to him, and the story of the two angels is declared to be 
a fabrication. But the Jews are blamed for learning from these two sources, i.e., by 
their fabrications against Solomon and the story of the two angels, things by 
which they made a distinction between a man and his wife. These words refer to 
secret gatherings of the nature of masonic societies, for it is in freemasonry and in 
no other religious society of the world that women are totally excluded. The 
words, they cannot hurt with it anyone except with Allah 's permission, show that 
by this craft they intended to inflict some injury on the Holy Prophet. 

b (104) Ra'i-na is equivalent to listen to us, but with a slight change of 
accent it becomes ra'ina, which means he is foolish. The word unzur-na, which 
means wait for us or grant us a little delay, is suggested instead, because it cannot 
be distorted. Morally the injunction is worthy of the highest regard, as it disappro- 
ves of the use of words bearing a sinister meaning. 

c (106) The objection of the Jews was: Why was another revelation sent

all things? 107 Do you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the 
heavens and the earth, and that besides Allah you have not any 
friend or helper? 108 Rather you wish to put questions to your 
Messenger, as Moses was questioned before. And whoever adopts 
disbelief instead of faith he indeed has lost the right direction of 
the way. 109 Many of the people of the Book wish that they could 
turn you back into disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy 
from themselves, after truth has become clear to them. But pardon 
and forgive, till Allah bring about His command." Surely Allah is 
Powerful over all things. 

110 And keep up prayer and give the due charity. And what- 
ever good you send on ahead for yourselves, you will find it with 
Allah. Surely Allah is Seer of what you do. m And they say: None 
shall enter the Garden except he who is a Jew, or the Christians.* 
These are their vain desires. Say: Bring your proof if you are 
truthful. 112 No, whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and he 
is the doer of good (to others), he has his reward from his Lord, 
and there is no fear for such nor shall they grieve. c 



down to Muhammad, and why was a law containing new commandments promul- 
gated? The answer is that if one law (i.e. the Jewish law) was abrogated, one 
better than it was given through the Holy Prophet. The doctrine that some of the 
Quranic verses were abrogated by others, though a generally accepted view, is due 
to a misconception of the words of this verse and is based simply on conjecture. 
There are no discrepancies in the Quran, and it is want of reflection on it that is 
responsible for the theory of abrogation. 

a (109) Note that Muslims are told to pardon and forgive even such enemies. 

b (111) What is said here may be expanded thus: The Jews say that none 
shall enter the Garden except a Jew and the Christians say that none shall enter 
the Garden except the Christians. Both degraded religion to a belief in a set of 
doctrines, and leading a life of righteousness was not considered as of the essence 
of religion. 

c (112) Their assertions that only the Jews and the Christians will be saved 
are groundless. It is entire submission to God and the doing of good to His crea- 
tures that is the true source of salvation, and that is what 'Islam' means according 
to the Holy Quran. The name Islam is derived from aslama, meaning 'submission' 
or 'entering into peace'. See also 3:19 footnote. 



2:113' PERFECT GUIDANCE IS ONLY IN ISLAM 25 



Section 14: Perfect Guidance is only in Islam 

113 And the Jews say, The Christians follow nothing (good), 
and the Christians say, The Jews follow nothing (good), while 
they recite the (same) Book. Even thus say those who have no 
knowledge, like what they say." So Allah will judge between them 
on the day of Resurrection in that in which they differ. 

114 And who is more unjust than he who prevents (people) 
from the mosques of Allah, from His name being remembered in 
them, and strives to ruin them? (As for) these, it was not proper 
for them to enter them except in fear. For them is disgrace in this 
world, and theirs is a grievous punishment in the Hereafter. 
115 And Allah's is the East and the West, so whichever way you 
turn, there is Allah's purposed Surely Allah is Ample-giving, 
Knowing. 

116 And they say: Allah has taken to Himself a son — glory 
be to Him! Rather, whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His. 
All are obedient to Him. 117 Wonderful Originator of the heavens 



a (113) The Jews and the Christians are here blamed for denying all good in 
each other like ignorant people, despite both being followers of one Book, by 
which is here meant the Old Testament, which both accepted. As against this, the 
Quran accepts that there is partial truth in all religions. 

b (114) The idolatrous Quraish had turned the Muslims out of the Sacred 
Mosque at Makkah and the Jews and the Christians were now helping them to 
annihilate the small Muslim community in Madinah, which practically meant the 
laying waste of the Sacred Mosque itself. The word mosques is used here because 
the Sacred Mosque was to be the centre of all the mosques of the world. This 
generalization further shows that the fate of all those who prevented Muslims 
from worshipping Allah in mosques is predicted here, and the fate of the oppo- 
nents of the Holy Prophet bears ample testimony to the truth of this prediction. 

c (115) These words point clearly to the Divine promise that all obstacles in 
the path of the Muslims will be removed and victory will follow their footsteps. 

rf(116) The phrase "glory be to Him" {subhana-hu) is always used to dec- 
lare the freedom of the Divine Being from all imperfections, and is always 
mentioned in connection with the Christian doctrine that God has a son to show 
that to attribute a son to the Divine Being is to attribute an imperfection to Him, 
which is met with in human beings. The doctrine of sonship is mentioned here as 
being opposed to the religion which requires entire submission to Divine

and the earth! And when He decrees an affair, He only says to it, 
Be, and it is." 118 And those who have no knowledge say: Why 
does not Allah speak to us or a sign come to us? Even thus said 
those before them, like what they say. Their hearts are all alike. 
Indeed We have made the messages clear for a people who are 
sure. 119 Surely We have sent you with the Truth as a bearer of 
good news and as a warner, and you will not be called upon to 
answer for the companions of the flaming Fire. 

120 And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor the 
Christians, unless you follow their religion. Say: Surely Allah's 
guidance — that is the (perfect) guidance. And if you follow their 
desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you shall have 
from Allah no friend, nor helper. 121 Those to whom We have 
given the Book follow it as it ought to be followed. e These believe 
in it. And whoever disbelieves in it, these it is that are the losers. 

Section 15: Covenant with Abraham 

122 O Children of Israel, call to mind My favour which I 
bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations. 123 And be 



commandments from every person and thus dispenses with the necessity of a 
conciliator. 

a (117) This is the oft-recurring phrase in which Allah's act of the creation 
and annihilation of things is spoken of in the Holy Quran. It is not meant by this 
that there is no gradual process in the creation of things. It is, in fact, an answer to 
those who think that the creation of things by God is dependent on the previous 
existence of matter and soul and the adaptability of their attributes. The argument 
given here in the word "Originator" (bad!') is that man, who stands in need of 
matter to make things, also stands in need of a pattern after which to make them, 
but God stands in need of neither. 

b (118) The answer to both these demands is contained in v. 119, for as a 
bearer of good news the Holy Prophet told them that if they purified themselves 
by walking in his footsteps, Allah would speak to them, and as a warner he 
informed them of the coming wrath (the sign which they often demanded) if they 
persisted in their evil ways. 

c (121) The Muslims are meant, while the Book is the Quran. 

d (122) The Israelites are three times told in the Holy Quran (see earlier 2:40 
and 2:47) that God had made them a great nation but that it was by their own evil

on your guard against a day when no soul will avail another in the 
least, neither will any compensation be accepted from it, nor will 
intercession benefit it, nor will they be helped. 

124 And when his Lord tried Abraham with certain commands 
he fulfilled them. He said: Surely I will make you a leader of 
people. (Abraham) said: And of my offspring? My covenant does 
not include the wrongdoers, said He." 125 And when We made the 
House a resort for people and a (place of) security, and (saying): 
Take the Place of Abraham for a place of prayer. c And We 



deeds and forsaking the ways of righteousness that they were proving themselves 
unworthy of that greatness. Here they are being addressed the third time and 
reminded of the covenant which was made with Abraham, the great patriarch in 
whom the Israelites and the Ishmaelites met. 

a (124) Abraham was made spiritual leader of people because he was found 
perfect in fulfilling the Divine commandments. As a spiritual leader of three great 
nations of the world, that patriarch occupies a unique position. Having discussed 
at length that a prophet from the Ishmaelites had come in accordance with the 
prophecies of the Israelite prophets, the Holy Quran now proceeds to show that 
even the covenant with their great ancestor Abraham necessitated the appearance 
of a prophet in Arabia. The second part of the verse states that the spiritual 
leadership of the world was still with Abraham's descendants. The covenant was 
made, not with Israel but with Abraham, and that therefore the seed of Ishmael 
and Isaac were equally to be blessed. In fact, as stated further on in 2:125, the 
covenant was made with both Abraham and Ishmael. The Jewish and Christian 
contention that the covenant made with Ishmael was simply of a temporal nature 
is groundless. 

b (125-1) Al-Bait or The House is the famous house known by this name to 
this day, the Ka'bah. It is also known as Bait Allah or the House of Allah, and is 
the same as the Bethel of the Bible. History bears out these three distinguishing 
characteristics of the Ka'bah. It exists from the remotest antiquity, it was visited 
annually by people from the most distant corners of Arabia, and its sacredness 
was respected by the whole of Arabia. 

c (125-2) The Ka'bah, the spiritual centre of Islam, was connected with the 
name of Abraham, and pointed reference to this is made in the mention of Maqam 
Ibrahim or the Place of Abraham. It is true that a particular place, a small building 
supported by six pillars about eight feet high, situated in the Ka'bah, is known by 
this name, and is incontrovertible evidence of Abraham's connection with Arabia 
and its spiritual centre. But here really Maqam Ibrahim stands for the House 
itself. The injunction to take the Place of Abraham for a place of prayer means 
that the Ka'bah shall be the Central Mosque of the Muslims. It is called the Place

commanded Abraham and Ishmael," saying: Purify My House for 
those who visit (it) and those who abide (in it) for devotion and 
those who bow down (and) those who prostrate themselves. 
126 And when Abraham said: My Lord, make this a secure town 
and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah 
and the Last Day. He said: And whoever disbelieves, I shall grant 
him enjoyment for a short while, then I shall drive him to the 
punishment of the Fire. And it is an evil destination. 

127 And when Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations 
of the House: e Our Lord, accept from us; surely You are the 
Hearing, the Knowing. 128 0ur Lord, and make us both submissive 
to You, and (raise) from our offspring, a nation submissive to 
You, and show us our ways of devotion and turn to us (merci- 
fully); surely You are the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful. 
129 0ur Lord, and raise up in them a Messenger from among them 
who shall recite to them Your messages and teach them the Book 



of Abraham because it was Abraham who purified it of the idols and it was 
Abraham who rebuilt The House as stated further on. 

a (125-3) Ishmael's connection with Arabia is established by the Bible itself, 
for Kedar (son of Ishmael, Genesis 25:13) stands throughout the writings of the 
Old Testament for Arabia (Psalms 120:5, Isaiah 42:11 and 60:7). The Arab tradi- 
tion representing Abraham as coming with Hagar and Ishmael to the place where 
now Makkah is, is quite independent of the Bible statement, and the facts recor- 
ded in the Quran are borne out fully by Arab tradition and the Bible. 

b (126) Abraham, when settling Hagar and Ishmael near the Sacred House, 
which was already there, laid the foundations of the city of Makkah there. While 
Abraham prayed for provisions of life for the righteous only, God's acceptance of 
the prayer included the wicked of that city as well (see 28:57). 

c (127) Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the Ka'bah, which was already there; 
see 14:37. 

d (128) The word translated as submissive is Muslim in the original. A Muslim 
is so called because he surrenders himself to the will of God or because he is 
secure from the slavery of the devil or because he enters into peace. Though all 
prophets were Muslims but only the followers of the Prophet Muhammad are 
known as a Muslim nation. At the time when these verses were revealed, there 
existed only a few Muslims in Madinah, and reference to a Muslim nation was 
still prophetical.

and the Wisdom, and purify them. Surely You are the Mighty, 
the Wise." 

Section 16: The Religion of Abraham 

130 And who forsakes the religion of Abraham but he who 
makes a fool of himself. And certainly We made him pure in this 
world, and in the Hereafter he is surely among the righteous. 
131 When his Lord said to him, Submit, he said: I submit myself to 
the Lord of the worlds. 132 And the same did Abraham command 
his sons, and (so did) Jacob: My sons, surely Allah has chosen for 
you (this) religion, so do not die except as submitting ones. 133 0r 
were you witnesses when death visited Jacob, when he said to his 
sons: What will you serve after me? They said: We shall serve 
your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and 
Isaac, one God only, and to Him do we submit. 134 Those are a 
people that have passed away; for them is what they earned and 
for you what you earn; and you will not be asked of what they did. 

135 And they say: Be Jews or Christians, you will be on the 
right course. Say: Rather, (we follow) the religion of Abraham, 
the upright one, 6 and he was not of those who set up partners (with 
Allah). 136 Say: We believe in Allah and (in) what has been 
revealed to us, and (in) what was revealed to Abraham, and 
Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and (in) what was 
given to Moses and Jesus, and (in) what was given to the prophets 
from their Lord, we make no distinction between any of them and 



a (129) The Messenger had appeared but the great task of teaching the Book 
and the Wisdom to the progeny of Ishmael, the Arabs, and the still greater task of 
purifying them of evil, had yet to be performed, and its mention at this time was 
therefore prophetical. The more one ponders on the unique transformation brought 
about by the Holy Prophet in Arabia, and through Arabia in the world, the more 
one's head bows before the grandeur of this prophecy. 

b (135) The word hanlf or "upright" is often mentioned in connection with 
the name of Abraham and the Holy Prophet, and his followers are also enjoined to 
be hanlf Muslims are enjoined to remain firm in the right state, and thus to be the 
true representatives of the Abrahamic faith in the world. It is for this reason that 
the word hanlf is used here in opposition to the attitude of both the Jews and the 
Christians. 



30 2. THE COW • 2 : 137 

to Him we submit." 137 So if they believe as you believe, they are 
indeed on the right course; and if they turn back, then they are 
only in opposition. But Allah will be sufficient for you against 
them; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing. 138 (We take) Allah's 
colour, and who is better than Allah at colouring, and we are His 
worshippers. 139 Say: Do you dispute with us about Allah, and He 
is our Lord and your Lord, and for us are our deeds and for you 
your deeds; and we are sincere to Him? 140 Or do you say that 
Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes were 
Jews or Christians? Say: Do you know better or Allah? And who 
is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony that he has from 
Allah? And Allah is not heedless of what you do. 141 Those are a 
people that have passed away; and for them is what they earned 



a (136) This shows the cosmopolitan nature of a Muslim's belief. Not only is 
belief in the great prophets of Israel an article of faith with a Muslim, but the 
words what was given to the prophets from their Lord make the Muslim concep- 
tion of belief in prophets as wide as the world. And it should be noted that this 
broad conception was promulgated at a time when the Jews and the Christians 
were exerting themselves to the utmost against the new faith. 

b (138) The religion of Islam is called Allah's colour because God is upper- 
most in a Muslim's ideas, and because his views are as broad as humanity. This 
particular word has also been adopted here as a hint to Christians that baptism of 
water does not effect any change in a person. It is the baptism of the broad prin- 
ciple of faith, accepting the prophets of all nations, that brings about change in the 
mentality of man. It is through this baptism that the new birth is received, because 
it opens the mind for the reception of all truth, and inspires it with love and rev- 
erence for all good people. 

c (139) A Muslim's conception of Allah is very broad. It includes all that is 
best in all other religions, but is free from the limitations they put. Therefore no 
one who is true to his religion can dispute the Muslim conception of the Divine 
Being. Moreover, every religion of the world limits the spiritual sustenance of 
God to one nation or one country. Not so Islam, which says that the truth was 
revealed to every nation. Every nation thus accepts partial truth, only that part of 
the truth which was revealed to it, but Islam accepts the whole truth. 

d (140) The Jewish claim was that only acceptance of the Jewish law could 
save man, and the Christians claimed that none could be saved unless he accepted 
the atonement of Jesus. They are told that their ancestors who were prophets were 
the followers of neither the one nor the other. Islam was, in fact, a reversion to the 
simple faith of sincerity, the faith of Abraham and his immediate followers and 
descendants.

and for you what you earn; and you will not be asked concerning 
what they did. 

Section 17: The Ka'bah as the Spiritual Centre 

142 The fools among the people will say: What has turned 
them from their qiblah which they had? Say: The East and the 
West belong only to Allah; He guides whom He pleases to the 
right path." 143 And thus We have made you an exalted nation 
that you may be the bearers of witness to the people and (that) the 
Messenger may be a bearer of witness to you. e And We did not 
make that which you would have to be the qiblah but that We 



a (142) Qiblah means the direction or point towards which one turns his 
face. In its religious usage it means the direction towards which a person turns his 
face when saying his prayers, and the qiblah is thus the Spiritual Centre of a 
people. The change here referred to is the change which took place at Madinah 
about sixteen months after the Prophet's flight to that city. While the Holy 
Prophet was at Makkah among the idolaters, he used to pray with his face to the 
Holy Temple at Jerusalem, but when he came to Madinah, where the Jewish ele- 
ment was strong and powerful, he was directed by Divine Revelation to turn his 
face to the Ka'bah as his qiblah. If Abraham's seed was to be blessed in Ishmael's 
progeny, it was necessary that the new Spiritual Centre should be the house puri- 
fied by Abraham and Ishmael, the First House appointed for mankind, the temple 
at Jerusalem being only the spiritual centre of the Israelites. 

b (143-1) The word wasat ("exalted") signifies the middle part of anything; 
and therefore, as being removed from either extreme, it signifies the best part of a 
thing. The commentators explain wasat as meaning equitable and exalted. By making 
the Ka'bah their qiblah, Allah had made it known that they were the people, the 
Muslim nation, for whom Abraham had prayed (v. 128), and therefore they were 
the inheritors of all those Divine blessings which had been promised to the seed of 
Abraham. 

c (143-2) The bearers of witness are the persons who carry knowledge to 
others, bearing testimony to its truth in their own persons. Some commentators 
explain the word shahid ("bearer of witness") as meaning a purifier. But it also 
means an Imam or a leader, and the significance is that just as the Prophet deli- 
vered the message of truth to the Muslims and was their purifier and leader, the 
role of the Muslim community was to deliver the message of truth to the whole of 
humanity and to be its purifiers and leaders. 

d (143-3) The words "that which you would have to be the qiblah" mean on 
which you had firmly set your heart that it should be your qiblah. It thus appears 
that the Prophet longed that the Ka'bah should be his qiblah, yet he did not take

might distinguish him who follows the Messenger from him who 
turns back upon his heels. And it was indeed a hard test except for 
those whom Allah has guided. Nor was Allah going to make your 
faith to be fruitless. Surely Allah is Compassionate, Merciful, to 
the people. 144 Indeed We see the turning of jour face to heaven, so 
We shall surely make you master of the qiblah which you like; a 
turn then jour face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever 
you are, turn your faces towards it. And those who have been 
given the Book certainly know that it is the truth from their Lord. 
And Allah is not heedless of what they do. 

145 And even if you should bring to those who have been 
given the Book every sign they would not follow jour qiblah, nor 
can jou be a follower of their qiblah, neither are they the follow- 
ers of each other's qiblah. c And ifjou should follow their desires 
after the knowledge that has come to jou, then jou would indeed 
be from among the wrongdoers. 146 Those whom We have given 
the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons, but some of 



any step until he had received the Divine Revelation. If his revelations had been 
the outcome of his own desires he would not have waited for sixteen months for a 
revelation from on high to change the qiblah. 

a (144-1) The Holy Prophet is here told that the Ka'bah will not remain an 
idol temple, as he will soon be master of it, and idolatry will forever be swept off 
from the new Spiritual Centre of the world. 

b (144-2) The truth of the Prophet was manifest so far as the Jews and the 
Christians were concerned. There was a clear prophecy for the appearance of a 
Prophet who was to be the like of Moses; see Deut. 18:15-18. They also knew 
that God had promised to bless Ishmael, but that no prophet had up to this time 
appeared from among the Ishmaelites. They also knew that Ishmael was left in 
Arabia, and they identified his son, Kedar, with the Arabs. Isaiah 21:13 speaks in 
clear words of a prophecy about "Arabia" and of the Prophet's Flight. The Bait 
Allah (Ka'bah) was the only Beit-el that the world knew. 

c (145) Every sign of the Prophet's truth had been given to them already but 
their hearts were so hardened that they did not pay any attention to the clearest 
signs. But they were not agreed even among themselves. Although the Jews and 
Christians both looked to the temple at Jerusalem as their central temple, they 
were not agreed upon it as their qiblah or Spiritual Centre. 

d (146) All the prophets of Abraham's seed had hitherto appeared among the 
Children of Israel, and hence as they know their sons is equivalent to as they

from your Lord, so do not be from among the doubters." 

Section 18: The Ka'bah as the Spiritual Centre 

148 And everyone has a goal to which he turns (himself), so 
vie with one another in good works.* Wherever you are, Allah will 
bring you all together. Surely Allah is Powerful over all things. 
149 And from whatsoever place you come forth, turn your face 
towards the Sacred Mosque. e And surely it is the truth from your 



know the Israelite prophets, the significance being that the Israelites or the Jews 
recognized the Prophet who appeared among the Children of Ishmael, as they 
recognized the prophets who appeared among the Children of Israel. 

a (147) It is the reader who is addressed here. 

b (148) In making the Ka'bah the Spiritual Centre the Muslims are told that 
their goal, as a nation, is to lead the world on to the greatest good. Their race is 
not a race for material benefits, riches or power, but a race for the attainment of 
good and for the spread of good. Hence they must vie with one another in doing 
good. In the words that follow — wherever you are, Allah will bring you all 
together — they are told that they will be spread far and wide in the world, yet 
their goal must be one. The outward unity of the qiblah stands for their unity of 
purpose, and it forms the basis on which rests the brotherhood of Islam; hence the 
saying of the Prophet: "Do not call those who follow your qiblah unbelievers". 

c (149) The Ka'bah has never been supposed by any Muslim to possess any 
Divine attribute. The Muslims honour the Ka'bah because it is their Spiritual 
Centre; they do not worship it. It should also be borne in mind that the famous 
Black Stone was not one of the Arab idols, nor can the kissing of it in performing 
the pilgrimage be looked upon as a remnant of idolatry. That Stone stands only as 
a monument: "The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner- 
stone" (Psalms, 118:22). Ishmael was looked upon as rejected, and the covenant 
was considered to have been made with the children of Isaac, yet it was that rejec- 
ted stone, for which the Black Stone at the Ka'bah stands as a monument, that 
was to become "the chief cornerstone". Jesus Christ made this clear in the parable 
of the husbandmen, when he plainly told the Israelites that the vineyard (i.e., the 
kingdom of God) would be taken away from them and given to "other husband- 
men", i.e. to a non-Israelite people, giving indication of that people in the words: 
"Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected has 
become the chief cornerstone?" (Matthew, 21:42). And he added: "The kingdom 
of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it" 
(Matthew, 21:43), thus showing that he was referring to a rejected nation which 
was to become the corner-stone of the Divine kingdom.

Lord. And Allah is not heedless of what you do. 150 And from 
whatsoever place you come forth, turn your face towards the 
Sacred Mosque. And wherever you are, turn your faces towards it, 
so that people may have no plea against you except such of them 
as are unjust — so do not fear them and fear Me — and that I may 
complete My favour to you and that you may go aright." 151 Even 
as We have sent among you a Messenger from among you, who 
recites to you Our messages and purifies you and teaches you the 
Book and the Wisdom and teaches you what you did not know. 
152 Therefore glorify Me, I will make you eminent, and give thanks 
to Me and do not be ungrateful to Me. 

Section 19: Hard Trials necessary to establish Truth 

153 O you who believe, seek assistance through patience and 
prayer; surely Allah is with the patient. 154 And do not speak of 
those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Rather, (they are) 
alive, but you do not perceive. 155 And We shall certainly try you 



a (150) By completing of favour is meant the bestowing of spiritual favours 
on the Muslims. In the next verse they are told that they have been raised to carry 
the Divine message to other people and to purify them and teach them the Book 
and the Wisdom. If that message was not conveyed to other people they had a 
plea against the Muslims that they had not conveyed the Truth to them. The turn- 
ing of the face to the Sacred Mosque is thus equivalent to proclaiming the Truth 
which had its origin in the Ka'bah to the whole world. The Ka'bah was the house 
rebuilt by Abraham and Ishmael, and with prophethood now being transferred to 
the descendants of Ishmael, the Spiritual Centre had necessarily to be changed. 
The Ka'bah was moreover the first Spiritual Centre of the world (3:96), and it was 
in the fitness of things that it should be the last Spiritual Centre of the whole 
world. 

b (151) The reference is to Abraham's prayer in v. 129. The functions of the 
Promised Prophet there are exactly the same as here. 

c (152) These words may be translated either as remember Me I will remem- 
ber you or as glorify Me I will make you eminent, for the word dhikr carries either 
significance, remembrance or honouring. Adopting either significance, what is 
stated here is that if the Muslims keep God in the forefront of their programme, 
they will be made great as a nation. 

d (154) The sacrifice of life which must be undertaken in the cause of Truth 
is hinted at in this passage. The words rendered literally as in Allah 's way or in

with something of fear and hunger and loss of property and lives 
and fruits. And give good news to the patient," 156 who, when a 
misfortune befalls them, say: Surely we are Allah's, and to Him 
we shall return. 157 Those are they on whom are blessings and 
mercy from their Lord; and those are the followers of the right 
course. 

158 The Safa and the Marwah are truly among the signs of 
Allah; c so whoever makes a pilgrimage to the House or pays a 
visit (to it), there is no blame on him if he goes round them. And 
whoever does good spontaneously — surely Allah is Bountiful in 
rewarding, Knowing. 159 Those who conceal the clear proofs and 
the guidance that We revealed after We have made it clear in the 
Book for people, these it is whom Allah curses, and those who 

the cause of Allah, frequently occurring in the Holy Quran, signify the cause of 
Truth. A Christian translator's comment that the words in the way of Allah mean 
"war undertaken against unbelievers for the propagation of Islam" is baseless. 
Carrying the message of Islam to non-Muslims is indeed the duty of a Muslim, 
and anyone engaged in this work is undoubtedly working in the way of Allah, but 
that a Muslim was required to carry the message of God at the point of the sword 
is no more than a myth. 

a (155) The Muslims had already made great sacrifices in the cause of Allah. 
They had left their homes, their near and dear ones and everything they had, 
behind them at Makkah, and had come to Madinah empty-handed, but they were 
now told that they would have to make more sacrifices yet. They would have to 
face fear and hunger and all kinds of losses, even death itself. If they bore all 
these sufferings with steadfastness, they would have a great future, of which the 
good news is given to them beforehand. Those who have sacrificed their lives in 
the cause of Truth gain the life eternal, while the dead are really those who are dead 
in ignorance. 

b (156) This is the true expression of a Muslim's resignation under trials: We 
are Allah 's and to Him we shall return. He resigns himself to the will of God so 
thoroughly that no trial or misfortune can disturb the course of his life, which has 
a much higher goal before it than mere comfort. 

c (158) The Safa and the Marwah are two mountains near Makkah. They 
were the scene of Hagar's running to and fro in quest of water when left alone 
with Ishmael in the wilderness. These two mountains now serve as two monu- 
ments of the reward which patience brought, and it is as a memorial to Hagar's 
patience that they are now gone round by the pilgrims.

curse, curse them (too)." 160 Except those who repent and amend 
and make manifest (the truth), these it is to whom I turn (merci- 
fully); and I am the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful. 
161 Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, these 
it is on whom is the curse of Allah and the angels and people, of 
all (of them): ' 162 abiding in it; their punishment shall not be light- 
ened nor shall they be given respite. 163 And your God is one God; 
there is no God but He! He is the Beneficent, the Merciful. c 

Section 20: Unity must prevail 

164 In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alter- 
nation of night and day, and the ships that run in the sea with that 
which benefits mankind, and the water that Allah sends down 
from the sky, then gives life with it to the earth after its death and 
spreads in it all (kinds of) animals, and the changing of the winds 
and the clouds made subservient between heaven and earth, there 
are surely signs for a people who understand. 165 Yet there are 
some people who take for themselves objects of worship besides 



a (159) As against those who willingly endure all kinds of sufferings in the 
cause of truth, the Quran now speaks of people who hide the truth, i.e., they neither 
act according to it, nor do they carry the message to others. These words convey a 
warning to the Muslims. 

6(161) This verse continues the subject-matter of v. 159, the disbelievers 
spoken of here being those who hide the truth. The curse of God stands for their 
estrangement from God, the curse of the angels signifies their loss of all incentive 
to good and noble deeds, and the curse of people signifies their subjugation to 
other people. 

c (163) The mention of Divine Unity is to show that it was for this object 
that the trials and privations spoken of in this section were to be undergone. The 
ultimate triumph of Divine Unity is spoken of in the next section. 

d (164) The unity of God is declared by the whole of nature, and being such 
a clear doctrine, must no doubt at last prevail over idolatry and polytheism of 
every kind. Not only did Arabia witness the truth of this at the time of the Holy 
Prophet, but even today we see that, as man is freed from the trammels of pre- 
judice, he realizes the truth of Divine Unity more and more. The uniformity that is 
clearly observed in the diversity of nature is constantly appealed to in the Quran 
as a sign of the Unity of the Maker.

Allah," whom they love as they should love Allah. And those who 
believe are stronger in (their) love for Allah. And if only the 
wrongdoers had seen, when they see the punishment, that power is 
wholly Allah's, and that Allah is Severe in punishing! 166 When 
those who were followed renounce those who followed (them), 
and they see the punishment and their ties are cut apart. i fi7 And 
those who followed will say: If only we could return, we would 
renounce them as they have renounced us. Thus will Allah show 
them their deeds to be intense regret to them, and they will not 
escape from the Fire. c 

Section 21: Prohibited Foods 

168 O people, eat the lawful and good things from what is in 
the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of the devil. Surely he is 
an open enemy to you. 169 He commands you only (to commit) 
evil and indecency, and that you speak against Allah what you do 
not know. 



a (165-1) The objects of worship here referred to may include idols, but the 
reference is apparently to the leaders who lead their followers into evil. This is 
made plain by the verses that follow, where "those who were followed", i.e. the 
leaders, renounce those who followed them. 

b (165-2) While Allah's love for His creatures is the ever-recurring theme 
expressed in the Quran, the believer's love for Allah, or absolute submission to 
the Divine Being, is here declared to be stronger than all other ties of love and 
friendship, including that which unites a man to his idols or other false deities. 

c (167) The mutual renouncement of the leaders and their followers takes 
place sometimes in this very life. It should also be noted that it is the intense regret 
for the evil deeds done, here described as being the Fire, from which there is no 
escape. 

rf(168) The fundamental principle of faith, Divine Unity, having been 
discussed, certain secondary rules and regulations are now considered, and among 
these the subject of prohibited foods is introduced first with a twofold object. 
Firstly, only lawful and good things should be eaten. Lawful things are not only 
those which the law has not declared to be forbidden, but even unforbidden things 
become unlawful if they are acquired unlawfully, by theft, cheating, etc. Secondly, 
by adding the injunction do not follow the footsteps of the devil, the Quran 
recognizes some sort of relation between the physical and the spiritual conditions 
of man. 



38 2. THE COW • 2 : 170 

170 And when it is said to them, Follow what Allah has 
revealed, they say: But we follow that (path) upon which we found 
our fathers. What! Even though their fathers had no sense at all, 
nor did they follow the right way. 171 And the parable of those who 
disbelieve is as the parable of one who calls out to that which hears 
no more than a call and a cry. Deaf, dumb, blind, so they have no 
sense." 172 you who believe, eat of the good things that We have 
provided you with, and give thanks to Allah if He it is Whom you 
serve. 173 He has forbidden you only what dies of itself, and 
blood, and the flesh of swine, e and that on which any other name 
than that of Allah has been invoked. Then whoever is driven by 
necessity, not desiring, nor exceeding the limit, no sin is upon him. 
Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

174 Those who conceal anything of the Book that Allah has 
revealed and take for it a small price, they eat nothing but fire into 
their bellies/ and Allah will not speak to them on the day of 



a (171) The Prophet is likened to the crier who calls out, but the disbelievers 
are deaf to reason, and are like cattle which only hear the cry of the driver, but do 
not understand the meaning of what he says. This is in accordance with what is 
said in the previous verse. 

b (172) The injunction to eat of the good things is directed against the use of 
things which are injurious to health, though they may not be forbidden by law. 

c (173-1) The Jews held the swine in great detestation, and the mention of 
the animal in the Gospels shows that Jesus Christ held it in equal abhorrence, 
which proves that he too regarded the animal as impure. Neither does he appear to 
have broken the Jewish law in this respect. 

d (173-2) The words that over which any other name than that of Allah has 
been invoked are said by commentators to refer to animals slaughtered by the 
worshippers of idols, which they used to slaughter as offerings to their idols or to 
those over which the name of an idol is invoked at the time of its slaughter. But 
the statement made in the Quran is general, and the invocation of any name other 
than that of Allah makes the animal slaughtered unlawful. 

e (174) The prohibition to eat certain impure or injurious foods is followed 
by a warning against the eating of fire. Caution is always given lest too much stress 
should be laid upon the outward ceremonial of the law. Even more dangerous than 
the prohibited foods is the eating of fire, which means the concealing of what is 
revealed in the Book. The concealment in this case means not acting upon the 
teaching of the Book. The Muslims are warned of the danger of being strict in 
external acts of purity while neglecting internal purity. 



2:175' RETALIATION AND BEQUESTS 39 

Resurrection, nor will He purify them; and for them is a painful 
punishment. 175 Those are they who buy error for guidance and 
punishment for forgiveness; how bold they are to challenge the 
Fire! 176 That is because Allah has revealed the Book with truth. 
And surely those who disagree about the Book go far in opposi- 
tion." 

Section 22: Retaliation and Bequests 

177 It is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards 
the East and the West, but righteous is the one who believes in 
Allah, and the Last Day, and the angels e and the Book and the 



a (176) By those who disagree about the Book are meant people who accept 
one part of the Divine Revelation and reject the other, as the Jews and the Chris- 
tians did, the Book in this case standing for the whole of the Divine Revelation 
which is accepted by the Muslims only. Or, the Book stands for the Quran, and 
their disagreement means their rejection of it. 

b (177-1) A warning is given to the Muslims that they should not fall into 
the error into which the previous people fell, who sacrificed the spirit of religion 
for the outward ceremonial. The essence of religion is faith in God and benevo- 
lence towards people. The turning of the face to the East and the West refers to 
the outward act of facing a certain direction when saying prayers. This, though 
necessary, should not be taken as the real object of prayer, which is in fact meant 
to enable one to hold communion with the Divine Being and to imbue oneself with 
Divine morals as explained further on. 

c (177-2) A belief in angels is one of the basic principles of Islam. This 
belief is accepted generally in all monotheistic religions. As in the case of all 
other principles of faith, Islam has pointed out a certain significance underlying 
the belief in angels. There are two attractions placed in humans — the attraction 
to good or to rise up to higher spheres of virtue, and the attraction to evil or to 
stoop down to a kind of low, bestial life. If we respond to the attraction for good 
we are following the angel or the Holy Spirit, and if we respond to the attraction 
for evil we are following the devil. Our belief in angels carries, therefore, the sig- 
nificance that whenever we feel a tendency to do good we should at once obey 
that call. It does not simply mean that we should admit that there are angels. This 
is clear from the fact that not only are we not required to believe in devils, whose 
existence is as certain as that of the angels, but we are plainly told that we should 
disbelieve in the devils (2:256). As a disbelief in the devil means that we should 
repel the attraction for evil, so a belief in angels means that we should follow the 
inviter to good.

prophets, and gives away wealth out of love for Him to the near 
of kin and the orphans and the needy and the traveller and to those 
who ask and to set slaves free c and keeps up prayer and gives the 
due charity; and the performers of their promise when they make a 
promise, and the patient in distress and affliction and in the time 
of conflict. These are they who are truthful; and these are they 
who keep their duty. 

178 O you who believe, retaliation is prescribed for you in the 
matter of the slain: the free for the free, and the slave for the slave, 
and the female for the female. 2 But if remission is made to one by 
his (aggrieved) brother, prosecution (for blood-money) should be 
according to usage, and payment to him in a good manner/ This 
is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. Whoever exceeds 
the limit after this, will have a painful punishment. 179 And there is 
life for you in retaliation, you people of understanding, that you 
may guard yourselves. 



a (177-3) The Book stands for Divine Revelation in general or the scriptures 
of all the prophets. 

b (177-4) The love of Allah is here, as in many other places in the Quran, 
stated to be the true incentive to all deeds of righteousness. 

c (177-5) The basis was thus laid down for the abolition of slavery. 

d (177-6) The performance of promise on the part of individuals as well as 
of nations is one of the first essentials of the welfare of humanity, and hence the 
stress laid upon it by the Quran. Faithlessness to treaties and pledges on the part 
of nations has wrought the greatest havoc on humanity. Just as no society can 
prosper until its individual members are true to their mutual agreements and 
promises to each other, so humanity at large can never have peace unless the 
nations are true to their agreements. 

e (178-1) The Jewish law of retaliation is greatly modified in Islam, being 
limited only to cases of murder, while among the Jews it extended to all cases of 
grievous hurt. The words retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the 
slain mean that the murderer should be put to death. The pre-Islamic Arabs used 
in certain cases to insist, when the person killed was of noble descent, upon the 
execution of others besides the murderer. The Quran abolished this custom. 

/(178-2) There may be circumstances which alleviate the guilt. In such 
cases the murderer may be made to pay a fine to the relatives of the murdered 
person. Such money is called diyat or blood-money. A comparison with 4:92 makes it 
clear that when homicide is not intentional, blood-money may be paid. 



2:180' FASTING 41 

180 It is prescribed for you, when death approaches one of 
you, if he leaves behind wealth for parents and near relatives, to 
make a bequest in a kindly manner; it is incumbent upon the 
dutiful." 181 Then whoever changes it after he has heard it, the sin 
of it is only upon those who change it. Surely Allah is Hearing, 
Knowing. 182 But if one fears a wrong or a sinful course on the part 
of the testator, and effects an agreement between the parties, there 
is no blame on him. Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

Section 23: Fasting 

183 O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you, as it was 
prescribed for those before you, so that you may guard against 
evil. 184 For a certain number of days. But whoever among you is 
sick or on a journey, (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days. 
And those who find it extremely hard may effect redemption by 
feeding a poor one. c So whoever does good spontaneously, it is 
better for him; and that you fast is better for you if you know. 



a (180) Some commentators hold the opinion that the direction here, to make 
a bequest, is abrogated by 4:1 1 which fixes the shares of the heirs of the deceased 
person. However, that verse clearly recognizes the validity of any bequest that 
may have been made. In practice, however, traced to the Prophet himself, the right 
to make a will has been subject to the condition that not more than a third of the 
property shall be bequeathed, and that those who take as heirs shall not be entitled 
to take under the bequest. Hence, this verse really speaks of bequests made for 
charitable purposes and not of bequests to heirs. 

b (183) Fasting is a religious institution almost as universal as prayer, and in 
Islam it is one of the five fundamental practical ordinances. "Fasting has in all ages 
and among all nations been an exercise much in use in times of mourning, sorrow 
and affliction" (Cruden's Bible Concordance). But Islam has introduced quite a 
new meaning into the institution of fasting. It becomes an institution for the 
improvement of the moral and spiritual condition of man. This is plainly stated in 
the concluding words: so that you may guard against evil. The object is that man 
may learn how he can shun evil, and hence fasting in Islam does not mean simply 
abstaining from food, but from every kind of evil. Abstention from food is only a 
step to make a person realize that if he can, in obedience to Divine injunctions, 
abstain from that which is otherwise lawful, how much more necessary is it 
to abstain from the evil ways which are forbidden by God. 

c (184) The first two classes exempted are: (a) those who are sick and 
(b) those journeying. Both are required to fast afterwards when sickness or

shall fast in it, and whoever is sick or on a journey, (he shall fast) 
a (like) number of other days. Allah desires ease for you, and He 
does not desire hardship for you, and (He desires) that you should 
complete the number and that you should exalt the greatness of 
Allah for having guided you and that you may give thanks.

am near. I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls on

journey ends. What is sickness or journey every person can determine for himself. 
Someone who needs a medicine or is unable to bear the hardship of hunger or 
thirst should not fast. In journeying again, whether one can easily fast or not is the 
determining factor. The third exception is in the case of those who find it 
extremely difficult to bear the hardship of fasting. Such people may effect a 
redemption by giving food daily to a poor person. This exception covers the case 
of pregnant women, women who are breast feeding infants, old people who cannot 
bear fasting; also such sick people whose sickness is prolonged and such people 
whose journey extends over the whole year. 

a (185-1) The revelation of the Quran commenced in the month of Ramadan, 
the ninth month of the Arabian year; hence, the month of Ramadan is particularly 
spoken of as being the month in which the Quran was revealed. 

b (185-2) Elsewhere we are told that it was revealed on the Lailat al-Qadr or 
the Night of Majesty (97:1), a well-known night in the month of Ramadan, being 
the 25th or 27th or 29th night of that month. By the revelation of the Quran in the 
month of Ramadan is therefore meant the commencement of its revelation. 
The month of Ramadan is thus a memorial of the revelation of the Quran. 

c (185-3) Firstly, the Quran is a "guidance" for all people, and therefore it 
contains teachings suitable and sufficient for all people in all countries and ages. 
Secondly, it contains "clear proofs" to demonstrate the truth of what it asserts. 
Thirdly, it contains arguments which afford a "criterion" (Arabic \furqan), separa- 
ting truth from falsehood. 

d (186) This verse speaks of the nearness of God to man and of the accept- 
ance of his prayers to show that fasting is a spiritual exercise and it brings about 
spiritual awakening in man. Fasting undoubtedly awakens a living consciousness 
of the existence of God in the mind. This is the idea underlying the words: "When 
My servants ask you concerning Me". A real and earnest search for God is raised 



2:187* FASTING 43 

187 It is made lawful for you to have intercourse with your 
wives on the night of the fast. They are an apparel for you and you 
are an apparel for them. a Allah knows that you acted unjustly to 
yourselves, so He turned to you in mercy and removed (the burden) 
from you. So now be in contact with them and seek what Allah 
has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the whiteness of the 
day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn, then 
complete the fast till nightfall/ and do not touch them while you 
keep to the mosques. These are the limits of Allah, so do not go 
near them. Thus does Allah make clear His messages for people 
that they may keep their duty. 188 And do not swallow up your pro- 
perty among yourselves by false means, nor seek to gain access 
thereby to the judges, so that you may swallow up a part of the 
property of (other) people wrongfully while you know. 6 

in the mind through fasting. "I am near" is the reply to that inner search. And then 
follow the words: "I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls on Me". 
God is near, but that consciousness only raises the further desire to get nearer and 
nearer to Him. For that man calls on God; he prays to Him to draw him closer and 
closer to Himself. And he is told that God accepts this prayer. 

a (187-1) First, the sex instinct is classed with hunger and thirst. It is a natural 
desire and one could not live without satisfying it. And then in these words — 
your wives are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them — we are told 
that while satisfying a natural desire, the relation of husband and wife has higher 
ends in view. They serve as a garment for each other, i.e., they are a means of 
protection, comfort and even embellishment for each other, and the weakness of 
one is made up by the strength of the other. 

b (187-2) Muslims at first thought that it was illegal to have intercourse with 
their wives even at night, on the days during which they kept fasts. These words 
made it clear that this was permitted during the nights of fasting as the satisfaction 
of hunger and thirst was permitted. 

c (187-3) In countries where the days are sometimes very long, the time of 
fasting may be measured in accordance with the length of an ordinary day, or 
where practicable postpone the fasts to shorter days of about normal length. 

d (187-4) Those people are meant who cut themselves off from all worldly 
connections during the last ten days of Ramadan, passing day and night in the 
mosques. This practice, known as I'tikaf is voluntary and not obligatory. 

e (188) The command to abstain from illegally taking other people's pro- 
perty is a fitting sequel to the injunction relating to fasting, for by fasting a person 
abstains from using what he has a legal right to, simply in obedience to Divine

Section 24: Fighting in Defence 

189 They ask you about the new moons. Say: They are times 
appointed for people, and (for) the pilgrimage. a And it is not 
righteousness that you enter houses by their backs, but he is 
righteous who keeps his duty. And go into houses by their doors; 6 
and keep your duty to Allah, that you may be successful. 

190 And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight 
against you but do not be aggressive. Surely Allah does not love 
the aggressors. c 191 And kill them wherever you find them, and 
drive them out from where they drove you out, and persecution is 
worse than slaughter/ And do not fight with them at the Sacred 



commandments. Fasting, in fact, enables one to control his passions, and the more 
the passions are mastered, the less the greed for illegal acquisition. 

a (189-1) The reference in "new moons" is in particular to the four months 
of the year which the Arabs observed as sacred (the 11th, 12th, 1st and 7th). All 
hostilities ceased and peace was established throughout the land; thus trade was 
carried on without molestation. The pilgrimage to Makkah was also performed 
during these months. 

b (189-2) Entering by the back indicates turning aside from the right course, 
while entering by the doors signifies sticking to the right course. This also refers 
to a superstitious custom of pre-Islamic Arabs, whereby when one of them failed to 
attain his objective he would not enter his house by the door but by the back. 

c (190) This is one of the earliest revelations permitting Muslims to fight. It 
is remarkable that fighting in the way of Allah is here expressly limited to fighting 
in defence. Muslims were required to fight in the way of Allah, but they could 
fight only against those who waged war on them. Exactly the same limitation is 
placed on what was in all probability the first revelation permitting fighting: 
"Permission (to fight) is given to those on whom war is made because they are 
oppressed" (22:39). Muslims were allowed to take up the sword only as a measure 
of self-defence. The enemies of Islam, being unable to suppress Islam by perse- 
cution, and seeing that Islam was now safe at Madinah and gaining strength, took 
up the sword to annihilate it. No course was left for the Muslims but either to be 
swept off the face of the earth or take up the sword in defence against an enemy 
which was immensely stronger. 

d (191-1) The words kill them refer to those with whom fighting is enjoined 
in the previous verse, who waged war upon the Muslims. 

e (191-2) The word translated as "persecution" is fitna. Ibn Umar explained 
the w 'or d fitna when he said: "And there were very few Muslims [in the begin- 
ning], so a man used to be persecuted on account of his religion: they either

Mosque until they fight with you in it; so if they fight you (in it), 
kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers. 192 But if 
they cease, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful." 193 And fight 
them until there is no persecution, and religion is only for Allah. 
But if they cease, then there should be no hostility except against 
the oppressors. 194 The sacred month for the sacred month, and 
retaliation (is allowed) in sacred things. c Whoever then acts 
aggressively against you, inflict injury on him according to the 
injury he has inflicted on you and keep your duty to Allah, and 
know that Allah is with those who keep their duty. 195 And spend 
in the way of Allah and do not cast yourselves to destruction with 
your own hands and do good (to others). Surely Allah loves the 
doers of good. 

196 And accomplish the pilgrimage and the visit for Allah. 
But if you are prevented, (send) whatever offering is easy to 
obtain; and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its 
destination. Then whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of 
the head, (he may effect) a compensation by fasting or (giving in) 
charity or sacrificing. And when you are secure, whoever profits 
by combining the visit with the pilgrimage (should take) whatever 
offering is easy to obtain. But he who cannot find (an offering) 
should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and for seven days 

murdered him or subjected him to tortures until Islam became predominant, then 
there was aofitna " (Bukhari, 65.2:30). 

a (192) Note the clemency of the Islamic fighting injunctions. Muslims were 
to sheathe their swords if the enemy desisted from fighting. 

b (193) When persecution ceases, and people are not forced to accept or 
renounce a religion, then there should be no more fighting. If they cease persecu- 
tion, Muslims are at once to stop fighting against them, and hostilities are not to 
be continued against any except the aggressors. 

c (194) This is similar to what is said in v. 191 regarding the Sacred Mosque. 
The pre-Islamic Arabs observed four months in the year as sacred, in which 
hostilities ceased and peace was established throughout the land. If the opponents 
violated the sacred months by attacking the Muslims first in those months, the 
Muslims were permitted to fight against them in the sacred months. And generally 
retaliation within the limits of the original act of aggression is permitted in the 
case of all sacred objects.

when you return. These are ten (days) complete. This is for him 
whose family is not present in the Sacred Mosque. And keep your 
duty to Allah, and know that Allah is Severe in retribution." 

Section 25: The Pilgrimage 

197 The months of the pilgrimage are well known; so who- 
ever determines to perform pilgrimage in them, there shall be 
no immodest speech, nor abusing, nor altercation in the pilgri- 
mage. And whatever good you do, Allah knows it. And make 
provision for yourselves, the best provision being to keep one's 
duty. And keep your duty to Me, you people of understanding. 
198 It is no sin for you that you seek the bounty of your Lord. e So 
when you press on from Arafat, remember Allah near the Holy 



a (196) The two subjects of war and pilgrimage are linked because Muslims 
were free at Madinah to perform all the religious ordinances required by Islam, 
but they were not free to perform the pilgrimage, their Spiritual Centre, Makkah, 
being in the possession of their enemies who were at war with them. The "visit" 
or 'umrah may be performed at any time, whilst the "pilgrimage" or hajj can only 
be performed at a particular time of the year. The pilgrimage represents the last 
stage in the progress of the spiritual pilgrim. The first requirement of the pilgri- 
mage, ihram, represents the severance of all worldly connections for the love of 
God. All costly dresses in which the inner self is so often mistaken for the out- 
ward appearance, are cast off, and the pilgrim has only two seamless wrappers to 
cover himself. The other important requirement is making circuits round the 
Ka'bah, called tawaf, and running between the Safa and the Marwah, called sa 'y, 
and both these are external manifestations of that fire of Divine love which has 
been kindled within the heart, so that like the true lover, the pilgrim makes 
circuits round the house of his beloved One. 

b (197) The pilgrimage represents the final stage of spiritual progress, and 
hence the pilgrim is told not to speak words which should be a source of annoy- 
ance to anybody. Perfect love of God requires perfect peace with fellow beings; 
hence no offence should be caused to anyone. The doing of good to others is re- 
commended instead in the words whatever good you do, Allah knows it. 

c (198-1) Seeking the bounty of the Lord here stands for trading. What is 
meant is that there is no harm in seeking an increase of wealth by trading in 
Makkah in the pilgrimage season. 

d (198-2) 'Arafat is the place where the pilgrims assemble on the 9th of the 
month of Dhii-l-Hiijah, towards the close of the pilgrimage. Here the vast gather- 
ing from all countries and nations clad in one dress, with one utterance, labbaika

Monument," and remember Him as He has guided you, though 
before that you were certainly in error. 199 Then hasten on from 
where the people hasten on, and ask the forgiveness of Allah. 
Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

200 And when you have performed your devotions, extol 
Allah as you extolled your fathers, rather a stronger extolling/ 
But there are some people who say: Our Lord, give us (good) in 
the world. And for such there is no portion in the Hereafter. 
201 And there are some among them who say: Our Lord, grant us 
good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and save us from the 
punishment of the Fire. d 202 For those there is a portion on account 
of what they have earned. And Allah is Swift in reckoning. 203 And 
remember Allah during the appointed days. Then whoever hastens 
off in two days, it is no sin for him; and whoever stays behind, it 
is no sin for him, for one who keeps his duty. 6 And keep your duty 
to Allah, and know that you will be gathered together to Him. 

Allah-umma labbaika (here I am, O Allah, in Your Presence), declares the glory 
of God. The word 'Arafat is derived from 'arafa, meaning he knew, or acquainted 
himself with, a thing, and there is undoubtedly a reference in this name to the fact 
that here people feel truly the august Divine presence. 

a (198-3) This is the place known as Muzdalafah, or the ground bordering on 
it, where the pilgrims stop for the night after their return from Arafat on the eve- 
ning of the 9th Dhu-l-Hijiah. 

b (199) The Quraish and the Kananah used to stay at Muzdalafah, thinking it 
beneath their dignity to join other pilgrims in going to the plain of Arafat. As all 
distinctions were levelled by Islam, they were told to consider themselves on a par 
with others 

c (200) In pre-Islamic times people used to boast among themselves of the 
greatness of their fathers after they had performed the pilgrimage. The Quran for- 
bade people to boast of the greatness of their fathers, and told them to celebrate 
the praise of Allah instead. 

d (201) This is the true Muslim's prayer. As he is taught to pray for both the 
good of this life and that of the next, so he should exert himself to attain good in 
this life as well as in the Hereafter. 

e (203) The appointed days are the three days following the day of Sacrifice, 
and are called the days of Tashrlq. Ordinarily pilgrims leave on the afternoon of 
the last day of Tashrlq days, but they are allowed to leave on the evening of the 
second day.

204 And among people is he whose speech about the life of 
this world pleases you, and he calls Allah to witness as to what is 
in his heart, yet he is the most violent of adversaries. 205 And when 
he holds authority, he makes effort in the land to cause mischief in 
it and destroy crops and offspring; and Allah does not love 
mischief. 206 And when it is said to him, Be careful of your duty to 
Allah, pride carries him off to sin — so hell is sufficient for him. 
And certainly evil is the resting-place. a 207 And among people is 
he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is 
Compassionate to the servants. 

208 O you who believe, enter into complete peace and do not 
follow the footsteps of the devil. Surely he is your open enemy. 
209 But if you slip after clear arguments have come to you, then 
know that Allah is Mighty, Wise. 210 They only wait that Allah 
should come to them in the shadows of the clouds with angels, 
and the matter has (already) been decided. And to Allah are (all) 
matters returned. 

Section 26: Trials and Tribulations 

211 Ask the Children of Israel how many a clear sign We 
gave them! And whoever changes the favour of Allah after it has 
come to him, then surely Allah is Severe in retribution. 212 The 
life of this world is made to seem attractive to those who 
disbelieve, and they mock those who believe. And those who keep 
their duty will be above them on the day of Resurrection. And 
Allah gives to whom He pleases without measure. 



a (206) Mihad ("resting-place") means a cradle, and also what a man has 
prepared for himself. Hell is a thing which a man prepares for himself; and for a 
new spiritual growth in the Hereafter in the case of those who retarded that 
growth in this world, it serves the same purpose as the cradle for a child. Else- 
where hell is called an umm or mother (101:9). 

b (210) The coming of Allah stands for the coming of the threatened punish- 
ment for those who wanted to annihilate Islam. The matter has already been 
decided, because it was repeatedly made clear in the earliest revelations that all 
opposition to Islam would perish. 

c (211) The favour of Allah is the Quran and its change implies its rejection. 



2:213' TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS 49 

213 Mankind is a single nation. " So Allah raised prophets as 
bearers of good news and as warners, and He revealed with them 
the Book with truth, that it might judge between people in that in 
which they differed. And none but the very people who were 
given it differed about it after clear arguments had come to them, 
envying one another/ So Allah has guided by His will those who 
believe to the truth about which they differed. And Allah guides 
whom He pleases to the right path. 214 0r do you think that you 
will enter the Garden, while there has not yet come upon you the 
like of what befell those who have passed away before you. 
Distress and affliction befell them and they were shaken violently, 
so that the Messenger and those who believed with him said: 
When will the help of Allah come? Now surely the help of Allah 
is near! e 



a (213-1) The oneness of humanity is a truth on which the Quran lays the 
greatest stress. They are sometimes told that they have all been "created of a single 
being" (4:1); again that they are all descended from the same parents (49:13); still 
again that they are as it were dwellers in one home, having the same earth as a 
resting-place and the same heaven as a canopy (2:22). Hence also the conclusion 
that prophets were raised among all nations which is conveyed in the words that 
follow. 

b (213-2) As all people are a single nation (umma), God, too, has been 
revealing Himself to all. This Law of Divine Revelation has, we are told, found 
expression through prophets, to every one of whom a revealed Book was given to 
show them the right way. 

c (213-3) The universal law expressed here is that corruption followed gui- 
dance. As time passed on, the very people to whom the Book was given so that 
they might follow it, went against it. Thus, though a prophet had been raised in 
every nation, yet every nation had forsaken the right way. Differences again arose 
which necessitated the advent of another prophet. Hence it was necessary to raise 
a prophet who should show the right way to all nations, and this is what is stated 
in the words that follow. 

d (213-4) Allah's guiding those who believe refers to the raising of the 
Prophet Muhammad, through whom Muslims were guided to the right path, to the 
truth, regarding which differences had arisen among all people. If a prophet was 
needed by every nation to settle its own differences, one was surely now needed 
to settle the differences of the various nations. Thus among the different national 
religions of the world, Islam occupies the position of an international religion. 

e (214) This verse inculcates faith and perseverance under the hardest trials

215 They ask you as to what they should spend. Say: What- 
ever wealth you spend, it is for the parents and the near of kin and 
the orphans and the needy and the traveller. And whatever good 
you do, Allah surely is Knower of it. 

216 Fighting is ordained for you, though it is disliked by you; 
and it may be that you dislike a thing while it is good for you, and 
it may be that you love a thing while it is harmful for you; and 
Allah knows while you do not know." 

Section 27: Miscellaneous Questions 

217 They ask you about fighting in the sacred month. Say: 
Fighting in it is a grave (offence). And hindering (people) from 
Allah's way and denying Him and the Sacred Mosque and turning 
its people out of it, are still graver with Allah; and persecution is 
graver than slaughter. And they will not cease fighting you until 
they turn you back from your religion, if they can. 6 And whoever 
of you turns back from his religion, then he dies while an un- 
believer — these it is whose deeds are fruitless in this world and 
the Hereafter. e And they are the companions of the Fire: in it they 



and is an indication of the Prophet's own unequalled endurance and faith. It refers 
not only to the great trials and hardships which Muslims had already suffered at 
Makkah and the privations which they had to undergo in their exile, but more 
particularly to the hardships which were yet in store for them, and which they 
could clearly see in the massing of all forces that could be used to annihilate them. 

a (216) Muslims were too weak to carry on the struggle against the mighty 
forces that were bent upon their destruction, and they disliked the war. A picture 
of distresses and afflictions to which the few converts to Islam were subjected is 
drawn in v. 214. They were few in numbers, poor, exiled, and distressed, yet it 
became inevitable that they should fight in self-defence or they would be des- 
troyed. It was their utter weakness and the enormous disparity of numbers that 
made them dislike the fighting. 

b (217-1) The unbelievers took up the sword to force the Muslims back into 
unbelief and they were determined to carry on the war until they gained this end. 
Note the words they will not cease fighting you until they turn you back from your 
religion, if they can, which disprove the false allegation that the Muslims started 
war to convert the unbelievers by force. 

c (217-2) The persons spoken of here are the apostates. A wrong impression 
exists that those who apostatize from Islam are to be put to death. This is entirely

will abide. 218 Those who believed and those who fled (their homes) 
and strove hard in Allah's way — these surely hope for the mercy 
of Allah. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

219 They askjou about intoxicants" and games of chance. 
Say: In both of them is a great sin and (some) advantage for 
people, and their sin is greater than their advantage. And they ask 
you as to what they should spend. Say: What you can spare. Thus 
does Allah make clear to you the messages that you may ponder 
220 on this world and the Hereafter. And they ask you concerning 
the orphans. c Say: To set right their affairs is good; and if you mix 
with them, they are your brethren. And Allah knows him who 



untrue. What is stated here is that the opponents of Islam exerted themselves to 
their utmost to turn back the Muslims from their faith by their cruel persecutions, 
and therefore if a Muslim actually went back to unbelief he would be a loser in 
this life as well as in the next, because the desertion of Islam would not only 
deprive him of spiritual advantages, but also of the physical advantages which 
must accrue to the Muslims through the ultimate triumph of Islam. Neither here 
nor anywhere else in the Quran is there even a hint at the infliction of capital or 
any other punishment on the apostate. In the matter of religion, the Quran gives 
perfect freedom to all to adopt whatever religion they like: "And say: The Truth is 
from your Lord; so whoever wishes, let him believe, and whoever wishes, let him 
disbelieve" (18:29). 

a (219-1) The word khamr used here includes all intoxicating substances. 
The prohibition spoken of here as regards both intoxicating liquors and games of 
chance is made plainer in 5:90. The prohibition of intoxicants in connection with 
the mention of war shows that Islam wanted to inspire true courage into its 
followers and disliked the reckless daring which a man shows under the influence 
of intoxicating liquors and which has so often led to atrocities in wars. The 
constant fighting of Arab tribes, one against the other, had made the habit of drink 
second nature to the Arab. Intoxicating liquors were the chief feature of their 
feasts, and the habit of drink was not considered an evil, nor had there ever been a 
temperance movement among them. Yet one word of the Holy Quran was suffi- 
cient to blot out all traces of it from among a whole nation. 

b (219-2) Intoxicants and gambling are both declared in 5:91 as causing 
"enmity and hatred among you", and a society the members of which are imbued 
with feelings of hatred and enmity towards each other could never prosper. 

c (220-1) From the earliest, the revelations of the Quran always speak of the 
orphans, the needy, and the slaves in the kindest words, and lay special stress on 
helping and feeding them. See 90: 11-16 and other places. 

d (220-2) Orphans are not to be treated as a separate class, and they should

makes mischief from him who sets (affairs) right. And if Allah 
pleased, He would have made matters difficult for you. Surely 
Allah is Mighty, Wise. 

221 And do not marry female idolaters until they believe; and 
certainly a believing maid is better than a female idolater even 
though she please you. Nor give (believing women) in marriage to 
idolaters until they believe, and certainly a believing slave is 
better than an idolater, even though he please you. These invite to 
the Fire and Allah invites to the Garden and to forgiveness by His 
will and He makes clear His messages to people that they may be 
mindful. 

Section 28: Divorce 

222 And they ask j^ou about menstruation." Say: It is harmful; 
so keep aloof from women during menstrual discharge and do not 
approach them (for intercourse) until they are clean. But when they 
have cleansed themselves, go to them as Allah has commanded 
you. Surely Allah loves those who turn much (to Him), and He 
loves those who purify themselves. 223 Your wives are a tilth for 
you, so go to your tilth when you like, and send (good deeds) 
beforehand for yourselves; and have regard for your duty to Allah 
and know that you will meet Him. e And give good news to the 
believers. 



not be treated as living on the charity of others; they must be treated as brethren. 

a (222-1) Just as war made many children orphans, it made many women 
widows, but questions relating to widowhood and divorce being somewhat analo- 
gous, the two questions are treated together here and further on. 

b (222-2) The word used (adh-an) signifies anything that causes a slight 
harm. It is not, however, the menstrual discharge that is called harmful here but 
having sexual relations while the woman is in that condition. The Jewish law con- 
tains a similar prohibition in Leviticus 18:19 and 20:18, though Jewish practice 
rendered it necessary that the separation between husband and wife should be 
complete. In Islam, it is limited to the cessation of sexual intercourse as the 
answer here shows. 

c (223) This verse shows that the real object of marital relations is not 
simply the satisfaction of sexual desires. (Editor's Note: The comparison of 
women to the land that is tilled is to show that it is through them that the crop of

224 And do not make Allah by your oaths a hindrance to your 
doing good and keeping your duty and making peace between

you to account for what is vain in your oaths, but He will call you 
to account for what your hearts have earned. And Allah is Forgiv- 
ing, Forbearing. 226 Those who swear that they will not have sexual 
relations with their wives should wait four months; e then if they 
go back, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 227 And if they resolve on a 
divorce/ Allah is surely Hearing, Knowing. 228 Divorced women 



the next generation of human beings grows and develops, both physically and in 
character. Men are also told here to do some act of moral goodness before 
approaching their wives sexually, and to have regard for duty to God which stands 
for having regard for one's duties towards others as required by God. Thus the 
husband is required to be mindful also of moral duty and responsibility in the 
matter of sexual relations with his wife, so that it should not be merely an occasion 
for him to gratify his lust selfishly with no regard for moral goodness or the rights 
of his wife.) 

a (224) This verse refers to the pre-Islamic Arab custom of Tla ', a way of 
temporarily putting off the wife which was effected by an oath in Allah's name 
not to have sexual relations with her. The result of this was that the husband 
considered himself free from all marital obligations. The first step to bring about a 
reform in the relations of husband and wife was that this practice was abolished. It 
is in reference to this that the taking of oaths against the doing of good to others is 
prohibited. The fulfilment of marital obligations is thus referred to as the doing of 
good and observance of duty and making peace between people. But the subject is 
generalized and the taking of all oaths to forbid oneself the doing of good or 
fulfilment of obligations is prohibited. See also 66:2 footnote. 

b (225) By vain oaths are meant unintentional or thoughtless oaths in ordinary 
conversation, and by what the hearts have earned is meant an oath intentionally 
taken. 

c (226) Ila' signifies an oath by a man that he shall not approach his wife. In 
pre-Islamic times the Arabs used to take such oaths frequently, and as the period 
of suspension was not limited, the wife was compelled sometimes to pass her 
whole life having neither the position of a wife nor that of a divorced woman free 
to marry elsewhere. The Quran declares that if the husband does not reassert 
conjugal relations within four months, the wife shall be divorced. Cases in which 
husbands desert wives, having neither conjugal relations with them nor divorcing 
them, must be dealt with practically as amounting to Tla ', so that after four months 
the wife should be free if she wants a divorce. 

d (227) The Islamic law of divorce is elastic and does not strictly limit the 
causes of divorce. Divorce is allowed if sufficient reason exists, but the right is to 



54 2. THE COW • 2 : 229 

should keep themselves in waiting for three courses." And it is not 
lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, 
if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have 
a better right to take them back in the meanwhile if they wish for 
reconciliation. And women have rights similar to those against them 
in a just manner, c and men are a degree above them. And Allah is 
Mighty, Wise. 

Section 29: Divorce 

229 Divorce may be (pronounced) twice; e then keep (them) in 
good fellowship or let (them) go with kindness/ And it is not lawful 

be exercised under exceptional circumstances. A wife can claim a divorce accord- 
ing to the Islamic law, which was not a right conferred on her by Jewish and 
Christian laws on divorce as formulated in Deuteronomy and Matthew. 

a (228-1) The period of waiting, or 'iddat, forms the first condition in the 
Islamic law of divorce. But for cases in which marriage is not consummated, no 
period of waiting is necessary; see 33:49. 

b (228-2) These words give a clear right to the parties to effect a reconcilia- 
tion and re-establish conjugal relations within the period of waiting. No special 
procedure is necessary for this but both the divorce and the reconciliation must 
take place in the presence of witnesses. If, however, the 'iddat is over and no 
reconciliation has been effected, the relation of husband and wife can be re- 
established by remarriage, which right is given to the parties by v. 232. 

c (228-3) The rights of women against their husbands are here stated to be 
similar to those which the husbands have against their wives. The change in this 
respect was really a revolutionizing one, for the Arabs hitherto regarded women 
as mere property. Women were now declared to have rights similar to those which 
were exercised against them. The equality of the rights of women with those of 
men was never previously recognized by any nation or any reformer. 

d (228-4) The statement that "men are a degree above them" does not nullify 
the rights asserted in the previous passage. The words are added simply to show 
that the husband is the head of the household. 

e (229-1) The divorce spoken of here is the revocable divorce of v. 228, after 
which a reconciliation may be effected in the waiting period. Islam allows a 
revocable divorce on two occasions only, so that the period of waiting in each of 
these two cases might serve as a period of temporary separation during which 
conjugal relations could be re-established. Remarriage of the same parties is

for you to take any part of what you have given them," unless both 
fear that they cannot keep within the limits of Allah. Then if you 
fear that they cannot keep within the limits of Allah, there is no 
blame on them for what she gives up to become free thereby. 
These are the limits of Allah, so do not exceed them; and whoever 
exceeds the limits of Allah, these are the wrongdoers. 

230 So if he divorces her (the third time), c she shall not be 
lawful to him afterwards until she marries another husband. If he 
divorces her, there is no blame on them both if they return to each 
other (by marriage), if they think that they can keep within the 
limits of Allah. And these are the limits of Allah which He makes 
clear for a people who know. 



true marriage union is indicated in the simple words keep them in good fellowship. 
If good fellowship is entirely absent the only remedy is to let the woman go with 
kindness. 

a (229-3) The full payment of the dowry to the wife by the husband is another 
condition relating to the Islamic law of divorce. (This is the nuptial gift the hus- 
band owes the wife, as agreed between them at the time of marriage.) 

b (229-4) These words give the wife a right to claim a divorce. Islam gives 
the wife the right to claim a divorce even on grounds of disliking her husband, if 
she is willing to forgo the whole or part of her dowry (i.e., nuptial gift from the 
husband). The words unless both fear that they cannot keep within the limits of 
Allah mean their inability to perform towards each other their marital obligations 
and to maintain good fellowship. The words if you fear refer to the properly cons- 
tituted authorities and this shows that the authorities can interfere in the matter. 

c (230-1) The words refer to the "letting go with kindness" of the previous 
verse, and hence by divorce here is meant the irrevocable divorce pronounced a 
third time, i.e., after there has been a divorce and a restitution of conjugal rights 
twice. 

d (230-2) When the wife has been divorced twice, after each of which 
reconciliation has been effected and has failed, the third divorce becomes irrevo- 
cable. It is not simply by repeating the pronouncement of divorce three times that 
the third pronouncement becomes irrevocable. A divorce should actually have 
taken place twice, followed each time by reconciliation, then and only then the 
third divorce becomes irrevocable. It would, in fact, be very rare. After the third 
irrevocable divorce, the husband cannot remarry the divorced wife until she has 
been married elsewhere and divorced; but it must be a genuine marriage and a 
genuine divorce.

231 And when you divorce women and they reach their 
prescribed time, then retain them with kindness or let them go 
with kindness and do not retain them for injury so that you exceed 
the limits." And whoever does this, he indeed wrongs his own soul. 
And do not take Allah's messages for a mockery,* and remember 
Allah's favour to you, and what He has revealed to you of the 
Book and the Wisdom, instructing you by it. And keep your duty 
to Allah, and know that Allah is the Knower of all things. 

Section 30: Remarriage of Divorced Women and Widows 

232 And when you divorce women and they end their term, 
do not prevent them from marrying their husbands if they agree 
among themselves in a lawful manner. With this is instructed he 
among you who believes in Allah and the Last Day. This is more 
virtuous for you and purer. And Allah knows while you do not 
know. e 233 And mothers shall suckle their children for two whole 
years, for him who desires to complete the time of suckling. And 
their maintenance and their clothing must be borne by the father 



a (231-1) If the husband is proved to give injury to the wife, he cannot retain 
her, and she can claim a divorce. Injury to the wife may be of a general nature or 
one given with the object of compelling her to remit her dowry to obtain a 
divorce. It is for the judge to see that the husband is not taking undue advantage 
of his position. On the other hand, the husband is enjoined to show liberality to 
the divorced wife, and the judge would no doubt see that the injunctions of the 
Quran were observed. It is made clear in 4:35 that decision in matters of divorce 
rests with the judges appointed, not with the husband or the wife. 

b (231-2) The injunctions relating to the kind treatment of women must not 
be taken lightly, we are told here. Retaining women to cause them injury has already 
been declared to be a transgression and emphasis is now laid on the proper obser- 
vance of these injunctions by stating that these are most serious matters relating to 
the welfare of society as a whole. 

c (232) As already stated, when a divorce is pronounced, the conjugal rela- 
tions can be re-established within the period of waiting. Here it is stated that if the 
period of waiting has elapsed, even then the former husband can remarry the 
divorced wife. The decision to re-marry is determined solely by mutual agreement 
between the former husband and wife, on terms of equality with one another. 

d (233) By mothers here are meant in particular, as the context shows, 
women who have been divorced having children to suckle. 



2:234' DIVORCED WOMEN AND WIDOWS 57 

according to usage. No soul shall be burdened beyond its capacity. 
Neither shall a mother be made to suffer harm on account of her 
child, nor a father on account of his child; and a similar duty 
(devolves) on the (father's) heir. But if both desire weaning by 
mutual consent and counsel, there is no blame on them. And if 
you wish to engage a wet-nurse for your children, there is no blame 
on you so long as you pay what you promised according to usage. 
And keep your duty to Allah and know that Allah is Seer of what 
you do. 

234 And (as for) those of you who die and leave wives behind, 
such women should keep themselves in waiting for four months 
and ten days; a when they reach their term, there is no blame on 
you for what they do for themselves in a lawful manner.* And 
Allah is Aware of what you do. 235 And there is no blame on you 
concerning what you speak indirectly in the asking of (such) 
women in marriage or keep (the proposal) concealed within your 
minds. Allah knows that you will have them in your minds, but do 
not give them a promise in secret unless you speak in a lawful 
manner. And do not confirm the marriage tie until the prescribed 
period reaches its end. And know that Allah knows what is in your 
minds, so beware of Him; and know that Allah is Forgiving, 
Forbearing. 

Section 3 1 : Provision for Divorced Women and Widows 

236 There is no blame on you if you divorce women while yet 
you have not touched them, nor appointed for them a portion. And 
provide for them, the wealthy according to his means and the 
restricted one according to his means, a provision according to 
usage. (This is) a duty on the doers of good. c 237 And if you divorce 



a (234-1) The period of waiting in the case of a widow is four months and 
ten days. But in case a divorced woman or a widow is pregnant, the period of 
waiting is extended to the time of delivery (65:4). 

b (234-2) The meaning is that the widow may look out for a husband and 
remarry. {Editor 's Note: The words "what they do for themselves in a lawful 
manner" place decisions about the widow's remarriage entirely in her hands.) 

c (236) The "portion" is the dowry due from the husband, so that even when 



58 2. THE COW • 2 : 238 

them before you have touched them and you have appointed for 
them a portion, (pay) half of what you have appointed unless they 
forgo or he forgoes in whose hand is the marriage tie." And it is 
nearer to dutifulness that you forgo. Nor neglect the giving of free 
gifts between you. Surely Allah is Seer of what you do. 

238 Guard the prayers and the most excellent prayer, and 
stand up truly obedient to Allah. 239 But if you are in danger (say 
your prayers) on foot or on horseback. And when you are secure, 
remember Allah as He has taught you what you did not know. 

240 And those of you who die and leave wives behind, should 
make a bequest in favour of their wives of maintenance for a year 
without turning (them) out. c Then if they themselves go away, 
there is no blame on you for what they do of lawful deeds con- 
cerning themselves. And Allah is Mighty, Wise. 241 And for divorced 
women, provision (must be made) in kindness. This is incumbent 

no dowry has been agreed upon, and marriage has not been consummated, libera- 
lity must be shown to the divorced wife, and some provision should be made for 
her, even though the husband may be in difficult circumstances. 

a (237) The husband is the person in whose hand is the marriage tie. His 
forgoing his due is equivalent to not claiming the half of the dowry which he is 
entitled to by this verse. Note that forgoing on the part of husbands is here stated 
to be the more commendable course. 

b (238) There are several opinions regarding what is meant by the term 
translated above as "the most excellent prayer". Most probably it does not refer to 
any particular prayer and means simply attending to prayer in the most excellent 
form. The guarding of prayers is not simply the observance of the outward form; 
it is both the form and the spirit to which attention is drawn. Prayers are to be said 
at stated times and a particular method is to be observed, but this does not mean 
that the Islamic prayer is devoid of spirit. The external form is needed to bring the 
inner faculty into exercise. As regards the spirit of prayer, attention is called to it 
again and again in the Quran. Elsewhere we are told: "Prayer keeps (one) away 
from indecency and evil" (29:45). In fact, the Quran condemns prayers which are 
devoid of spirit (107:4-6). 

c (240) What the widow obtains under this verse is in addition to the share of 
the deceased husband's property which she inherits under 4:1 1. It is plainly stated 
in 4:12 that anything to be paid under a will shall have precedence of the division 
of the property into shares under that verse. 

d (241) This provision is in addition to the dowry which must be paid to 



2:242* FIGHTING IN THE CAUSE OF TRUTH 59 

on those who have regard for duty. 242 Allah thus makes clear to 
you His messages that you may understand. 

Section 32: Fighting in the Cause of Truth 

243 Have you not considered those who went forth from their 
homes, and they were thousands, for fear of death. Then Allah 
said to them, Die. Then He gave them life." Surely Allah is 
gracious to people, but most people are not grateful. 244 And fight 
in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 
245 Who is it that will offer to Allah a goodly gift, so He multiplies 
it to him manifold? And Allah receives and amplifies, e and to Him 
you shall be returned. 

246 Have you not thought of the leaders of the Children of 
Israel after Moses? When they said to a prophet of theirs: Raise up 
for us a king, that we may fight in the way of Allah. He said: 
May it not be that you will not fight if fighting is ordained for 
you? They said: And what reason have we that we should not fight 
in Allah's way and we have indeed been deprived of our homes 
and our children? But when fighting was ordained for them, they 

them. Just as in the previous verse the widow is given an additional benefit, here a 
provision in addition to her dowry is recommended for divorced woman. This 
shows how liberal are the injunctions of the Quran regarding women. 

a (243) The thousands referred to are the Israelites who left Egypt with Moses. 
They left Egypt for fear of death, for death would surely have been their fate if 
they had not emigrated. The next incident in their history referred to here is the 
Divine commandment to them to "die". This is more fully stated in 5:21-26. 
Moses told them to enter the Holy Land "which Allah has ordained for you," but 
they refused and were made to wander about in the wilderness for forty years, so 
that that generation perished. This is also shown by their history as given in the 
Old Testament. It is also meant as a warning for Muslims, who are told that if 
they followed the footsteps of the Israelites, death must be their fate. 

b (244) See 2:190; fighting in Allah's way is equivalent to fighting in 
defence of faith. 

c (245) Allah receives and amplifies means that Allah receives the gift that is 
offered to Him and then amplifies it; in other words, any sacrifice made in the 
cause of Truth is amply rewarded by Allah. 

d (246) The prophet alluded to is Samuel. See 1 Samuel 8:19-20.

turned back, except a few of them. And Allah is Knower of the 
wrongdoers. 247 And their prophet said to them: Allah has raised 
Saul to be a king over you. They said: How can he have kingdom 
over us while we have a greater right to kingdom than he, and he 
has not been granted abundance of wealth? He said: Surely Allah 
has chosen him above you, and has increased him abundantly in 
knowledge and physique. And Allah grants His kingdom to whom 
He pleases. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing. 248 And their 
prophet said to them: Surely the sign of his kingdom is that there 
shall come to you the heart in which there is tranquillity from your 
Lord and the best of what the followers of Moses and the followers 
of Aaron have left," the angels bearing it. Surely in this there is a 
sign for you if you are believers. 

Section 33: Fighting in the Cause of Truth 

249 So when Saul set out with the forces, he said: Surely 
Allah will try you with a river. Whoever drinks from it, he is not 
of me, and whoever does not taste it, he is surely of me, except he 
who takes a handful with his hand. But they drank of it except a 
few of them. So when he had crossed it, he and those who 
believed with him, they said: We have today no power against 
Goliath and his forces. Those who were sure that they would meet 
their Lord said: How often has a small group overcome a numerous 
army by Allah's permission! And Allah is with the steadfast. 
250 And when they went out against Goliath and his forces, they 
said: Our Lord, pour out patience on us and make our steps firm 



a (248-1) The word tabut means a chest or a box, but also signifies the heart. 
Tranquillity from the Lord is not a thing which is placed in boxes, but the heart is 
its real repository. On five other occasions the coming down of saklnah, or 
tranquillity, is mentioned in the Quran, and every time it is the heart of the 
Prophet or the faithful that is the recipient of it. The coming of "the heart in which 
there is tranquillity" means the change which came over Saul when he was made 
king: "So it was, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, that God gave 
him another heart" (1 Samuel 10:9). The best of what the true followers of Moses 
and Aaron left are spiritual blessings, the highest being Divine inspiration. 

b (248-2) The meaning is that the tranquillity and inspiration were borne by 
the angels into the heart of Saul.

and help us against the disbelieving people. 251 So they put them to 
flight by Allah's permission. And David killed Goliath, and Allah 
gave him kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of what He pleased. 
And if it were not for Allah's repelling some people by others, the 
earth would certainly be in a state of disorder; but Allah is full of 
grace to the worlds. 252 These are the messages of Allah — We 
recite them to you with truth; and surely you are one of the 
messengers. 

253 We have made some of these messengers to excel others." 
Among them are they to whom Allah spoke, and some of them He 
exalted by (many) degrees of rank. And We gave clear arguments 
to Jesus son of Mary, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. 
And if Allah had pleased, those after them would not have fought 
with one another after clear arguments had come to them, but they 
disagreed; so some of them believed and some of them denied. 
And if Allah had pleased they would not have fought with one 
another, but Allah does what He intends. 

Section 34: Compulsion in Religion forbidden 

254 O you who believe, spend (on good works) out of what 
We have given you before the day comes in which there is no 
bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession. And the disbelievers 
— they are the wrongdoers. 

255 Allah — there is no god but He, the Ever-living, the Self- 
subsisting by Whom all subsist. Slumber does not overtake Him, 
nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and what- 
ever is in the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him but by 
His permission? c He knows what is before them and what is 



a (253-1) This also refers to the excellence of the Prophet Muhammad over 
all other prophets. 

b (253-2) Allah spoke to all, but there were some who were exalted above 
others by many degrees. 

c (255-1) Islam does not recognize the concept that man stands in need of 
any mediator to reconcile him with God, as in the sense of the Christian doctrine. 
The Prophet is the model for his people and in this sense he is called a shafT' or

behind them. And they encompass nothing of His knowledge except 
what He pleases. His knowledge extends over the heavens and the 
earth, and the preservation of them both does not tire Him. And 
He is the Most High, the Great." 

256 There is no compulsion in religion ' — the right way is 
indeed clearly distinct from error. So whoever disbelieves in the 
devil and believes in Allah, he indeed lays hold on the firmest 
handle which shall never break. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 
257 Allah is the Friend of those who believe — He brings them out 
of darkness into light. And those who disbelieve, their friends are 
the devils who take them out of light into darkness. They are the 
companions of the Fire; in it they abide. 

Section 35: How Dead Nations are raised to Life 

258 Have you not thought of him who disputed with Abraham 
about his Lord, because Allah had given him kingdom? c When 
Abraham said, My Lord is He Who gives life and causes to die, he 
said: I give life and cause death. Abraham said: Surely Allah causes 

an intercessor. Those who take him for their model are not all equally gifted, nor 
have all equal occasion for spiritual progress, though they exert themselves to 
their utmost. So Divine mercy takes them by the hand and amends are made for 
their shortcomings through the intercession of the Prophet. It is in this sense that 
Islam recognizes the doctrine of intercession in the life after death. 

a (255-2) This is a very well-known verse which goes under the name of 
ayat al-kursT, or the verse of knowledge, because it deals with the all-comprehen- 
sive knowledge of Allah. 

b (256) To all the allegations that the Holy Prophet preached Islam by the 
sword, this verse is a sufficient answer. Being assured of success, Muslims are 
told that when they hold power in their hands their guiding principle should be 
that there should be no compulsion in the matter of religion. The claim that this 
passage was directed only to the early converts and that it was abrogated later on 
is utterly baseless. 

c (258-1) The words "because Allah had given him kingdom" refer to 
Abraham. This is corroborated by 4:54. The Muslims are here told that just as a 
promise is given to them that they will be raised to great eminence, which is equi- 
valent to raising the dead to life, a similar promise was given to Abraham, that 
promise being in fact the basis of the present promise to the Prophet. 

d (258-2) As the discussion arose out of the promise given to Abraham that

the sun to rise from the East, so you make it rise from the West. a 
Thus he who disbelieved was baffled. And Allah does not guide 
the unjust people. 

259 Or like him who passed by a town, and it had fallen in 
upon its roofs. He said: When will Allah give it life after its death? 
So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him. 
He said: How long have you remained? He said: I have remained a 
day, or part of a day. He said: No, you have remained a hundred 
years; but look at jour food and drink — years have not passed 
over it! And look at your donkey! That We may make you a sign 
to people. And look at the bones, how We set them together then 
clothe them with flesh. So when it became clear to him, he said: I 
know that Allah is Powerful over all things. 

260 And when Abraham said, My Lord, show me how You 
give life to the dead, He said: Do you not believe? He said: Yes, 
but that my heart may be at ease. He said: Then take four birds, 
then tame them to incline to you, then place on every mountain a 
part of them, then call them, they will come to you flying; and 
know that Allah is Mighty, Wise. e 



his descendants would be made a great nation, it is clear that the reference here is 
to the life and death of nations. 

a (258-3) The disputant belonged to a race of sun-worshippers, and therefore 
if he could give life and cause death, he could control even his deity, the sun, and 
should be able to make it rise from the opposite direction. 

b (259) This refers to Ezekiel's vision as related in Ezekiel, ch. 37. The town 
is Jerusalem. The prophet dying for a hundred years is also an incident of the 
vision, standing symbolically for the death of the Jewish nation or the desolation 
of Jerusalem for almost a hundred years after Jerusalem was taken by Nebuchad- 
nezzar in 599 B.C. The bones were a symbol of the fallen condition of the house 
of Israel. The food and drink of the prophet not showing any influence of years, 
and his donkey still standing by, proves that the hundred years' death was only a 
vision. The vision made him a symbol of the whole Jewish nation, and his symbo- 
lic death for a hundred years represented the sorrows and afflictions of Israel for a 
similar period, after which they were once more to be restored to life. 

c (260) This is a sequel to v. 258, which speaks of the manifestation of 
Allah's power in the life and death of nations. In Genesis 15:8 Abraham is made 
to say, after receiving a promise of the land of Canaan: "Lord God, whereby shall 
I know that I shall inherit it?" The Quranic parallel to this is: "My Lord, show me

Section 36: Spending Money in the Cause of Truth 

261 The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of 
Allah is as the parable of a grain growing seven ears, in every ear 
a hundred grains. a And Allah multiplies (further) for whom He 
pleases. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing. 262 Those who spend 
their wealth in the way of Allah, then do not follow up what they 
have spent with reproach or injury, their reward is with their Lord, 
and they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve. 263 A kind word 
with forgiveness is better than charity followed by injury. And 
Allah is Self-sufficient, Forbearing. 

264 O you who believe, do not make your charity worthless 
by reproach and injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen 
by people and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. c So his 
parable is as the parable of a smooth rock with earth upon it, then 
heavy rain falls upon it, so it leaves it bare! They are not able to 
gain anything of what they earn. And Allah does not guide the 
disbelieving people. 265 And the parable of those who spend their 



how You give life to the dead." He believed in the Divine promise, but how 
would it be fulfilled? The answer to Abraham's how as given in the Quran is a 
perfectly intelligible parable. If he should take four birds and tame them, they 
would obey his call and fly to him even from distant mountains. The words "place 
a part (juz ') of them" can only mean one each of the four birds. The story of 
cutting the birds into pieces, in connection with this verse, is not traceable to any 
reliable authority, nor do these words occur here. {Editor 's Note: To revive a dead 
people with spiritual truth, from which they are running away like birds, they 
have to be tamed as one tames birds so that instead of being repelled away from 
the truth they are attracted towards it even from a great distance.) 

a (261) The expenditure of money must be accompanied with hard labour, as 
a seed cast on the ground unaccompanied by any labour would not grow. 

b (262) Gifts, whether given in the cause of national or individual suffering, 
must not be accompanied by any interested motives; hence the donor is forbidden 
even to mention them afterwards. 

c (264-1) This conveys a very strong disapproval of giving charity to be seen 
by people, making it utterly hateful in the sight of true believers. 

d (264-2) The concluding words of the parable show that the efforts of the 
disbelievers to deal a death-blow to Islam are meant here. They were spending 
their money to retard the advancement of Islam, but their efforts would be 
fruitless. 



2 : 266 • SPENDING MONEY IN THE CAUSE OF TRUTH 65 

wealth to seek Allah's pleasure and for the strengthening of their 
souls is as the parable of a garden on elevated ground, upon which 
heavy rain falls, so it brings forth its fruit twofold; but if heavy 
rain does not fall on it, light rain (is sufficient)." And Allah is Seer 
of what you do. 266 Does one of you like to have a garden of palms 
and vines with streams flowing in it — he has in it all kinds of 
fruits — and old age has overtaken him and he has weak 
offspring, when a whirlwind with fire in it strikes it so it becomes 
blasted. Thus Allah makes the messages clear to you that you may 
reflect. 

Section 37: Spending in the Cause of Truth 

267 O you who believe, spend (on good works) out of the 
good things that you earn and out of what We bring forth for you 
from the earth, and do not aim at the bad to spend from it, while 
you would not take it yourselves unless you turned a blind eye to it.* 
And know that Allah is Self-sufficient, Praiseworthy. 268 The devil 
threatens you with poverty and commands you to be miserly, and 
Allah promises you forgiveness from Himself and abundance. 
And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing; 269 He grants wisdom to 
whom He pleases. And whoever is granted wisdom, he indeed is 
given a great good. And none are mindful but those who have 
understanding. 270 And whatever you spend in charity or (whatever) 
vow you vow, Allah surely knows it. And the wrongdoers shall 
have no helpers. 

271 If you manifest charity, how excellent it is! And if you 
hide it and give it to the poor, it is good for you. c And it will do 



a (265) This is the parable of the believers who will reap the fruits of the 
sacrifices they make. 

b (267) Muslims are here enjoined to support the cause of Truth by spending 
good things, things which they love, and not to even think of giving bad things, 
things which they themselves would not accept from others. Elsewhere it is said: 
"You cannot attain to righteousness unless you spend out of what you love" 
(3:92). 

c (271) The manifesting of charity or giving charity openly is quite different 
from giving "to be seen by people", for which see v. 264. By the giving of charity

away with some of your evil deeds; and Allah is Aware of what 
you do. 272 Their guidance is not jour duty, but Allah guides whom 
He pleases. And whatever good thing you spend, it is to your good. 
And you do not spend but to seek Allah's pleasure. And whatever 
good thing you spend, it will be paid back to you in full, and you 
will not be wronged." 

273 (Charity is) for the poor who are confined in the way of 
Allah, 4 they cannot go about in the land; the ignorant man thinks 
them to be rich on account of (their) abstaining (from begging). 
Fou can recognize them by their mark — they do not beg of people 
demandingly. c And whatever good thing you spend, surely Allah 
is Knower of it. 

Section 38: Usury prohibited 

274 Those who spend their wealth by night and day, privately 
and publicly, their reward is with their Lord; and they have no 
fear, nor shall they grieve. 275 Those who swallow usury cannot 
arise except as he arises whom the devil prostrates by (his) touch. rf 

openly is meant the giving of subscriptions for the advancement of national or 
public welfare. The rule laid down here enjoins public as well as private acts of 
charity, mentioning public charity first, as that is of greatest importance. 

a (272) Muslims did not fight to bring the disbelievers into the fold of Islam; 
for that, the Prophet is told here in plain words, was not his responsibility. It was 
for the good of their people, for their defence, that the Muslims were required to 
raise subscriptions. Hence what they spent was for Allah's pleasure, because it 
was in the cause of truth. They are assured that for these deeds of sacrifice they 
will be fully rewarded. As regards private charity, Muslim charity was exercised 
not only for the welfare of their own people but also for that of non-Muslims. 
Islam did not allow difference of religion to be a hindrance in giving charity. 

b (273-1) "Confined in the way of Allah" included those who had to fight in 
defence of Islam but had no means of livelihood, those who could not go forth to 
trade because of insecurity, and those who were wounded in the fighting. 

c (273-2) Those who abstain from begging deserve to be assisted by private 
acts of charity. 

d (275-1) Riba means an addition over and above the principal sum that is 
lent and includes usury as well as interest. Just as charity is the broad basis of 
human sympathy, usury annihilates all sympathetic affection and leads to the 



2 : 276 • USURY PROHIBITED 67 

That is because they say, Trading is only like usury. And Allah 
has allowed trading and forbidden usury." To whomsoever then 
the exhortation has come from his Lord, and he refrains, he shall 
have what has already passed. And his affair is in the hands of 
Allah. And whoever returns (to it) — these are the companions of 
the Fire: in it they will abide. 276 AUah will blot out usury, and He 
causes charity to prosper. And Allah does not love any ungrateful 
sinner. 277 Those who believe and do good deeds and keep up 
prayer and give the due charity — their reward is with their Lord; 
and they have no fear, nor shall they grieve. 

278 O you who believe, keep your duty to Allah and relin- 
quish what remains (due) from usury, if you are believers. 
279 But if you do not, then be apprised of war from Allah and His 
Messenger^ and if you repent, then you shall have your capital. 



extreme of miserliness. Islam refused to allow the rich to grow richer by reducing 
the poor to still greater poverty, which is the real aim of usury. Usury causes man 
to be obsessed by love of wealth and selfishness; and this is, in fact, what is meant 
by the devil prostrating a devourer of usury. It may also be mentioned that while 
Islam enjoins acts of sacrifice to carry on the struggle for national existence, it 
prohibits usurious dealings which are the basis of modern warfare. All wars are 
now carried on with the help of loans, interest on which ultimately is a source of 
ruin to both the conquerers and the conquered. A just war, a war in self-defence, 
would always lead a community to acts of sacrifice to which they would be 
impelled in the interest of their own existence. 

a (275-2) In trade the capitalist takes the risk of loss along with the hope of 
profit, but in lending money on usury the whole of the loss is suffered by the one 
who uses his labour, while the capitalist may count upon his profit even in the 
case of loss in the actual concern. Hence trading is quite different from usury. 

b (276) Usury is here condemned, while charitable deeds are commended as 
being the real source of the prosperity of a nation or of humanity in general. It is a 
prophetic reference to the general tendency in the growth of civilization to lessen- 
ing rates of interest, so much so that usurious dealings, in the proper sense of the 
word, are becoming almost extinct, while the tendency for public charity or 
personal sacrifice in the interests of a community, or even humanity in general, is 
gaining ground. 

c (279) Going directly against the commandments of Allah is here described 
as a war with Allah and His Messenger. The money received as bank interest may 
be spent in the cause of Allah and His Messenger or for the propagation of Islam.

Wrong not, and you shall not be wronged. 280 And if (the debtor) is 
in difficulty, let there be postponement till (he is in) ease. And that 
you forgo it as charity is better for you, if only you knew. a 281 And 
guard yourselves against a day in which you will be returned to 
Allah. Then every soul will be paid in full what it has earned, and 
they will not be wronged. 

Section 39: Contracts and Evidence 

282 O you who believe, when you contract a debt for a fixed 
time, write it down. And let a scribe write it down between you 
with fairness; nor should the scribe refuse to write as Allah has 
taught him, so let him write. And let him who owes the debt 
dictate, and he should observe his duty to Allah, his Lord, and not 
diminish anything from it. But if he who owes the debt is unsound 
in understanding or weak, or (if) he is not able to dictate himself, 
let his guardian dictate with fairness. e And call to witness from 
among your men two witnesses; but if there are not two men, then 
one man and two women from among those whom you choose to 

In fact the Divine purpose in the prohibition of interest is fulfilled if interest is 
changed into charity. 

a (280) This indicates the kind of sympathy Islam demands. The poor man is 
not to be prosecuted and thrown into prison, and payment of debt must be post- 
poned till the debtor is able to pay, or, better still, the whole may be remitted as 
charity. 

b (282-1) If Islam enjoins charity and prohibits usury, it also requires that the 
greatest precautions must be taken for safeguarding property rights. The Arabs 
were quite an illiterate people, among whom writing was very rare. Even then they 
were required to put down all their transactions, great or small, in writing, except 
in hand-to-hand dealings. 

c (282-2) A guardian may be appointed for one who is not able to manage 
his own property because he is a minor or his understanding is not sound on 
account of age or any other reason. 

d (282-3) As women did not take much part in business, and might be 
unfamiliar with the transaction, two women are required instead of one man. 
(Editor's Note: It is quite unwarranted to presume from this advice that the evi- 
dence of two women equals the evidence of one man. According to 24:6-9 if a 
husband accuses his wife of adultery which she denies and he is the sole witness, 
her testimony is treated as of equal value to his. In 5:106 and 65:2 it is required to 



2 : 283 • CONTRACTS AND EVIDENCE 69 

be witnesses, so that if one of the two commits error, the one may 
remind the other." And the witnesses must not refuse when they 
are summoned. And do not be averse to writing it whether it is 
small or large along with the time of its falling due. This is more 
equitable in the sight of Allah and makes testimony surer and the 
best way to keep away from doubts. But when it is ready mer- 
chandise which you give and take among yourselves from hand to 
hand, there is no blame on you in not writing it down. And have 
witnesses when you sell to one another. And let no harm be done 
to the scribe or to the witnesses. And if you do (it), then surely it 
is a transgression on your part. And keep your duty to Allah. And 
Allah teaches you. And Allah is Knower of all things. 

283 And if you are on a journey and you cannot find a scribe, 
a security may be taken into possession.^ But if one of you trusts 
another, then he who is trusted should deliver his trust, and let him 
keep his duty to Allah, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony. 
And whoever conceals it, his heart is surely sinful. And Allah is 
Knower of what you do. 

have "two just ones" as witnesses and not specifically men. There are a number of 
reports in Hadith showing that the Holy Prophet Muhammad gave full weight to 
the testimony of a woman.) 

a (282-4) The personal pronoun humd may refer either to the testimony of 
the two witnesses or the two women. Reminding here stands for making up the 
deficiency of the other's memory. The Holy Quran does not say that no case 
should be decided except on the testimony of two witnesses, but requires ordinari- 
ly the calling of two witnesses at the time of the transaction, so that the deficiency 
of one may be rectified by the other. Cases may be decided on circumstantial 
evidence as well, which is sometimes stronger than the evidence of witnesses. The 
Quran itself speaks of Joseph's innocence being established on circumstantial 
evidence (12:26-27). 

b (282-5) The scribe and the witnesses must not be made to suffer loss in 
their own business. In other words, their convenience must be kept in view, and 
they should be paid. 

c (283) This does not mean that a security cannot be taken in any other case. 
Security may be taken when the lender does not trust the debtor. Also, advantage 
can be derived by the lender from the property which has been given into his 
possession as a security for the debt.

Section 40: Muslims shall be made Victorious 

284 To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and what- 
ever is in the earth. And whether you manifest what is in your 
minds or hide it, Allah will call you to account according to it." So 
He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. 
And Allah is Powerful over all things. 

285 The Messenger believes in what has been revealed to him 
from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. They all believe in Allah 
and His angels and His Books and His messengers. We make no 
distinction between any of His messengers. And they say: We hear 
and obey; our Lord, Your forgiveness (do we crave), and to You is 
the eventual course. 

286 Allah does not impose on any soul a duty beyond its 
ability. To its benefit is what (good) it earns, and to its detriment 
is what (evil) it works. Our Lord, do not punish us if we forget or 
make a mistake. Our Lord, do not lay on us a burden as You did 
lay on those before us. Our Lord, do not impose on us (afflictions) 
which we have not the strength to bear. And pardon us! And grant 
us protection! And have mercy on us! You are our Patron, so grant 
us victory over the disbelieving peopled 



a (284) This verse does not signify "Allah will call you to account for it" but 
that He "will call you to account according to it"; so that he who hides (i.e. keeps 
under control) his evil inclinations and he who manifests (i.e. gives vent to them) 
shall not be dealt with in the same manner, but according to their deserts. Almost 
the same statement is contained in 3:29, where it is said: "Say: Whether you hide 
what is in your hearts or manifest it, Allah knows it". Evil thoughts are not 
unpunishable, but evil inclinations which a man keeps suppressed, and which 
therefore gradually disappear, cannot be included in the category of evil thoughts; 
it is these that are meant here. 

b (285) The breadth of the Muslim faith, which has been dealt with on 
several occasions in this chapter, is again mentioned in reference to the triumph of 
the Muslims; for even if the Muslims were triumphant, their religion could not 
triumph over other religions unless established on very broad principles which 
should commend themselves to all. The triumph of the Muslim religion would be 
due to the excellence and breadth of its principles. Hence, even in these days of 
Muslim political decadence, Islam is making spiritual conquests. 

c (286) See next page. 



2:284' MUSLIMS SHALL BE MADE VICTORIOUS 71 

c (286) As a preliminary to the prayer for victory over the disbelieving people, 
there is one set of three petitions in the first part of the verse and another set of 
three petitions in the second part. The first three petitions made to God are do not 
punish us, do not lay on us the burden of sins, do not impose on us afflictions 
which we have not the strength to bear. Corresponding to these three petitions 
respectively are the three petitions in the second part, pardon us, grant us 
protection, have mercy on us. Thus corresponding to the desire to be saved from 
punishment is the petition that God may pardon His servant whatever faults he 
has committed; corresponding to the desire that one may not be burdened with 
sins is the petition that one may be granted protection from the commission of 
sins; and corresponding to the desire to be saved from afflictions which one has 
not the strength to bear is the petition for the mercy of God. 

It is noteworthy that if Muslims are taught to pray for victory over dis- 
believers, as here, they are at the same time taught to be humble and forgiving. 



Chapter 3 
ai 'immn The Family of Amran 

The name of this chapter is taken from the mention of 'Imran in v. 33, who is 
Amran of the Bible, the father of Moses and Aaron. It deals with the depar- 
ture of prophethood from the Mosaic dispensation. It opens with a rule of 
interpretation for Divine books, which is that any allegorical statement must 
be interpreted so as not to contradict the clear principles laid down by Divine 
revelation. This is a preliminary to a discussion of Christian doctrines, which 
are based on wrong interpretations of certain allegorical statements. The 
chapter then deals with: the last Divine elect of the Israelites, including Jesus, 
after whom the spiritual kingdom was granted to the Muslims, religious 
controversy with the Jews and Christians, and their opposition to Islam, testi- 
mony to the truth of Islam in previous scriptures, the need for Muslim unity, 
the need for Muslims to show perseverance in suffering as in the battle of 
Uhud, and how they will triumph in the end after their struggles. Almost the 
entire chapter was revealed in 3 A.H. 



Section 1 : Rule of Interpretation 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Best Knower," 2 Allah, (there is) no god but 
He, the Ever-living, the Self-subsisting, by Whom all subsist. 
3 He has revealed to you the Book with truth/ verifying what is 
(already) before it, and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel 



a (1) For explanation, see 2:1 footnote. 

b (2) As this chapter controverts Christian doctrines, it fittingly opens with 
two attributes of the Divine Being, the Ever-living and the Self-subsisting, which 
refute the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus Christ. The statement that there is no 
god but He contains an ideal expression of the religion of Islam in four words. 

c (3-1) "With truth" signifies that the Quran was revealed suitably to the 
requirements of wisdom and justice, and to the exigencies of the case; in other 
words, it was revealed at a time when revelation was sorely needed by humanity. 

d (3-2) Taurat is the name given to the books of Moses, or the Pentateuch, 
and hence its correct rendering is the Hebrew word Torah. The Taurat does not 
signify the Old Testament, because the latter is the name of the whole collection 



72 



3:4« RULE OF INTERPRETATION 73 

4 before, a guidance for the people," and He sent the Criterion. 
Those who disbelieve in the messages of Allah — for them is a 
severe punishment. And Allah is Mighty, the Lord of retribution/ 
5 Surely nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah. 
6 He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no 
god but He, the Mighty, the Wise. 

7 He it is Who has revealed the Book to you; some of its verses 
are decisive — they are the basis of the Book — and others are 
allegorical. Then those in whose hearts is perversity follow the 
part of it which is allegorical, seeking to mislead, and seeking to give 
it (their own) interpretation. 6 And none knows its interpretation 

of the books of the Israelite prophets. The word Injil (Gospel) does not signify the 
New Testament but the revelation granted to Jesus. 

a (4-1) The Torah and the Gospel were undoubtedly a guidance before the 
Quran; but even as they now exist, they afford guidance in many respects with a 
mixture of error, and contain numerous prophecies fulfilled in the advent of 
Prophet Muhammad. 

b (4-2) See 2:53 and 2:185 footnote 3. The Quran is here mentioned by the 
name Furqdn or that which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, and pro- 
vides a criterion, because it was sent to separate the truth in previous revelation 
from the falsehood which had found its way into it. As the Furqdn, or the 
criterion of truth, in the case of the Holy Prophet was also provided by the battle 
of Badr, this event is referred to in v. 13 as a prelude to the actual controversy. 

c (4-3) The word used here for retribution conveys the idea of avenging but 
not of revenge. 

d (7-1) The Quran establishes certain principles in clear words which are to 
be taken as the basis, while there are statements made in allegorical words or sus- 
ceptible to different meanings, the interpretation of which must be in consonance 
with the other parts and the spirit of the Book. When a certain principle is laid 
down in unmistakable words, any statement carrying a doubtful significance, or 
one which is apparently opposed to that principle, must be interpreted subject to 
the principle enunciated. The subject is appropriately dealt with here as a prelude 
to a controversy with the Christians, who attribute divinity to Jesus on the basis of 
certain ambiguous words or allegorical statements, without heeding the funda- 
mental principles established by the earlier prophets. 

e (7-2) These are people who do not care to seek the real interpretation which 
can only be found by referring to the principles laid down elsewhere but give an 
interpretation to an ambiguous verse alone, without considering it in conjunction 
with other similar verses or the principles laid down elsewhere. 



74 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 8 

except Allah, and those firmly rooted in knowledge. They say: We 
believe in it, it is all from our Lord." And none are mindful except 
those who have understanding. 8 Our Lord, do not make our hearts 
to deviate after You have guided us and grant us mercy from 
Yourself; surely You are the most liberal Giver. 9 Our Lord, surely 
You are the Gatherer of people on a day about which there is no 
doubt. Surely Allah will not fail in (His) promise. 

Section 2: Unity of God as Basis of all Religions 

10 Those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their child- 
ren will avail them at all against Allah. And they will be fuel for 
fire — n as was the case of the people of Pharaoh, and those 
before them! They rejected Our messages, so Allah destroyed 
them on account of their sins. And Allah is Severe in retribution. 
12 Say to those who disbelieve: You will be defeated, and driven 
together to hell; and evil is the resting-place. 13 Indeed there was 
a sign for you in the two armies (which) met together in encounter 
— one party fighting in the way of Allah and the other dis- 
believing, whom they saw twice as many as themselves with the 
sight of the eye. c And Allah strengthens with His aid whom He 
pleases. There is surely a lesson in this for those who have eyes. 



a (7-3) The words it is all from our Lord signify that there is no disagreement 
between the various portions of the Holy Book. Hence the rule of interpretation 
which they follow is that they refer passages which are susceptible to various inter- 
pretations to those whose meaning is obvious or to similar passages, and subject 
particular statements to general principles. 

b (12) This is one of the passages in which the punishment of this life, which 
is defeat, is spoken of in the same breath with the punishment of the Hereafter, 
which is hell. 

c (13) The reference here is to the battle of Badr. The actual strength of the 
two parties was: Quraish about 1000, Muslims 313. The Muslims saw the 
disbelievers to be twice as many as themselves, and therefore they appeared fewer 
in their eyes as compared with their actual numbers. The battle of Badr is here 
stated to be a sign of the truth of the Holy Prophet, not only because of the pro- 
phecies of victory contained in the Quran, but also because of the clear prophecy 
in the Bible in the book of Isaiah, 21:13-17. It speaks of future events in the land 
of Arabia, which clearly came to pass in the emigration of the Muslims to 
Madinah and the defeat, one year later, of the army of the Quraish. 



3:14' UNITY OF GOD AS BASIS OF ALL RELIGIONS 75 

14 The love of desires is made attractive to people — of women 
and sons and hoarded treasures of gold and silver and well-bred 
horses and cattle and crop produce. This is the provision of the life 
of this world. And Allah — with Him is the good goal (of life). 
15 Say: Shall I tell you of what is better than these? For those who 
guard against evil are Gardens with their Lord, in which rivers 
flow, to abide in them, and pure companions and Allah's goodly 
pleasure." And Allah is Seer of the servants. 16 Those who say: Our 
Lord, we believe, so forgive our sins and save us from the punish- 
ment of the fire. 17 The patient and the truthful and the obedient 
and those who spend (on good works) and those who ask Divine 
protection in the morning times. 

18 Allah bears witness that there is no god but He, and (so do) 
the angels and those possessed of knowledge, maintaining justice. e 
There is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise. 19 Surely the (true) 
religion with Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Book 



a (15) For the companions in paradise see 2:25 footnote 3. Among the 
blessings of paradise is Allah's goodly pleasure, which is elsewhere said to be the 
greatest of all the blessings of paradise (9:72). The addition of this word here 
shows that the blessings of paradise are spiritual. 

b (17) Seeking of Divine protection (istighfar) is really a prayer to attain to 
sinlessness. The righteous servants of God are here spoken of as possessing the 
great qualifications of steadfastness, truthfulness, obedience to God, spending in 
Allah's way, and finally as resorting to istighfar or Divine protection, which shows 
that it is one of the highest stages to which the spiritual pilgrim aspires. 

c (18) Allah bears witness to His Unity through nature, which is His handi- 
work, and also by His word made known through revelation. The angels bear 
witness by their working within man, whose nature bears testimony to Divine 
Unity. Those who have a true knowledge of the holy scriptures of any religion 
also bear testimony to the great truth of the Unity of Allah. The Unity of Allah is, 
in fact, the common principle which is recognized by all religions. 

The words maintaining justice most likely qualify those possessed of know- 
ledge, the meaning being that every possessor of knowledge, to whatever religion 
he may belong, bears witness to the grand truth of Divine Unity if he maintains 
justice in bearing witness. 

d (19) The meaning is that the principle of submission to God, thereby enter- 
ing into peace, has always been the true religion. According to the Holy Quran, 
Islam was the religion of all the prophets. The Israelite prophets who followed 



76 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 20 

differed only after knowledge had come to them, out of envy 
among themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the messages of 
Allah — Allah indeed is Quick at reckoning. 20 But if they dispute 
with you say: I submit myself entirely to Allah and (so does) he 
who follows me. And say to those who have been given the Book 
and the Unlearned (people):" Do you submit yourselves? If they 
submit, then indeed they follow the right way; and if they turn 
back, jour duty is only to deliver the message. And Allah is Seer 
of the servants. 

Section 3: Kingdom granted to another People 

21 Those who disbelieve in the messages of Allah and would kill 
the prophets unjustly and kill those among people who command 
(the doing of) justice, announce to them a painful punishment. 
22 Those are they whose deeds will be fruitless in this world and 
the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. 23 Have you not seen 
those who are given a portion of the Book? They are invited to 
the Book of Allah that it may decide between them, then some of 
them turn back and they withdraw/ 24 This is because they say: 
The Fire shall not touch us but for a few days; and what they forge 
deceives them regarding their religion. 25 Then how will it be when 
We gather them together on a day about which there is no doubt. 
And every soul shall be fully paid what it has earned, and they 
shall not be wronged? 

26 Say: O Allah, Owner of the Kingdom, You give the king- 
dom to whom You please, and take away the kingdom from whom 

Moses are spoken of as the prophets who submitted themselves (to Allah) (5:44). 
It is also the natural religion of man, as in 30:30 it is described as being "the 
nature made by Allah in which He has created mankind". 

a (20) By the Unlearned people are meant the Arabs. 

b (23-1) The Jews are spoken of as being given only a portion of the Book, 
because much of it had already been lost. Moreover, the Torah was not a complete 
law. 

c (23-2) The reference here is to the broad principles of religion regarding 
which the Jews and the Christians differed. The Book of Allah is the Holy Quran 
which gave a decision in the differences between them. 



3 : 27 • KINGDOM GRANTED TO ANOTHER PEOPLE 77 

You please, and You exalt whom You please and degrade whom 
You please. In Your hand is the good. Surely You are Powerful 
over all things. 27 You make the night to pass into the day and You 
make the day to pass into the night; and You bring forth the living 
from the dead and You bring forth the dead from the living; and 
You give sustenance to whom You please without measure." 

28 The believers should not take the disbelievers as allies 
rather than believers. And whoever does this has no connection 
with Allah — except that you guard yourselves against them, c 
guarding carefully. And Allah cautions you against His retribu- 
tion. And to Allah is the eventual coming. 29 Say: Whether you 
hide what is in your hearts or manifest it, Allah knows it. And He 
knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. 
And Allah is Powerful over all things. 30 On the day when every 
soul will find present whatever good it has done, and whatever 
evil it has done, it will wish that between it and that (evil) there 
were a long distance. And Allah cautions you against His retribu- 
tion. And Allah is Compassionate to the servants. 



a (27) Verses 26-27 refer to the fact that kingdom and honour shall be given 
now to another nation, whose night shall be made to pass into a day of triumph. 
The Jews had already been warned by Jesus that "the kingdom of God will be 
taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it" (Matthew, 21:43). A 
living nation of Muslims was brought forth from among the dead Arabs, and the 
living nation of Israelites was represented now by a people who were spiritually 
dead. 

b (28-1) The Muslims, being in a state of war with the disbelievers, were 
forbidden to look to their enemies to guard their interests or for help of any kind. 
The clear statement made in 60:8-9 settles the point beyond all doubt: "Allah 
does not forbid you, with regard to those who do not fight you for religion, nor 
drive you forth from your homes, that you show them kindness and deal with 
them justly. . . . Allah forbids you only with regard to those who fight you for 
religion, and drive you forth from your homes and help (others) in your expulsion, 
that you make friends of them". 

c (28-2) The meaning is: Do not look to them for guarding your interests, 
rather guard yourselves against them.

Section 4: Last Members of a Chosen Race 

31 Say: If you love Allah, follow me: Allah will love you, a 
and grant you protection from your sins. And Allah is Forgiving, 
Merciful. 32 Say: Obey Allah and the Messenger; but if they turn 
back, Allah surely does not love the disbelievers. 

33 Truly Allah chose Adam and Noah and the descendants of 
Abraham and the descendants of Amran above the nations,* 
34 offspring, one of the other. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 
35 When a woman of Amran c said: My Lord, I vow to You what is 
in my womb, to be devoted (to Your service), so accept (it) from 
me; surely You, only You, are the Hearing, the Knowing. 36 So when 
she gave birth to it, she said: My Lord, I have given birth to a 
female — and Allah knew best what she had given birth to — and 
the male is not like the female, and I have named it Mary, and I 
commend her and her offspring into Your protection from the 
accursed devil. 6 



a (31) The love of Allah is the great goal of life to which Islam leads. 

b (33) Here begins the story of Jesus Christ, the central figure of the Chris- 
tian religion, and as a preliminary we are told that if Jesus was chosen by God so 
were his great ancestors, Adam and Noah. The descendants of Abraham and 
Amran are then spoken of as having been chosen above the nations. For the 
choice of the descendants of Abraham, see 2:124 footnote. They are divided into 
two branches, the Israelites and the Ishmaelites. The former are here spoken of as 
the descendants of 'Imran, who is the same as Amran of the Bible. The descen- 
dants of Amran are Moses and Aaron. Moses became the founder of the Israelite 
law and Aaron the head of the Israelite priesthood. The last of this race were John 
and Jesus. Their parents, Zacharias and Mary, are first spoken of here. 

c (35) Imra 'at means a woman and also a wife. I take imra 'at 'Imran as 
meaning a woman of the family of Amran rather than wife of Amran because the 
name of a great ancestor is frequently used to indicate the nation which has 
sprung from him. According to tradition, however, 'Imran was the name of 
Mary's father, and therefore the words imra'at 'Imran may mean the wife of 
Amran. 

d (36-1) She had vowed the child to be devoted to the service of the Temple, 
but a female could not do the priestly work. 

e (36-2) Mary's mother while praying for Mary prays also for her offspring, 
because, while dedicating her daughter to the Temple, she entertained the hope 
that Mary would eventually become a wife and mother. 



3:37* BIRTH OF JESUS AND HIS MINISTRY 79 

37 So her Lord accepted her with a goodly acceptance and 
made her grow up a goodly growing, and gave her into the charge 
of Zacharias. Whenever Zacharias entered the sanctuary to (see) 
her, he found food with her. He said: Mary, from where does this 
come to you? She said: It is from Allah. Surely Allah gives to 
whom He pleases without measure." 38 There did Zacharias pray 
to his Lord. He said: My Lord, grant me from Yourself goodly 
offspring; surely You are the Hearer of prayer. 39 So the angels 
called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary: Allah gives you 
the good news of John, verifying a word from Allah, c and 
honourable and chaste and a prophet from among the good ones. 
40 He said: My Lord, how can I have a son when old age has 
already come upon me, and my wife is barren? He said: Even thus 
does Allah do what He pleases. 41 He said: My Lord, appoint a sign 
for me. Said He: Four sign is that you do not speak to people for 
three days except by signs. And remember your Lord much and 
glorify (Him) in the evening and early morning. 

Section 5: Birth of Jesus and his Ministry 

42 And when the angels said: O Mary, surely Allah has chosen 
you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the world. 
43 Mary, be obedient to your Lord and humble yourself and bow 
down with those who bow. 44 This is among the tidings of things 



a (37) Mary's reply, that she got sustenance/rom Allah, is the reply of every 
devout person who believes that Allah is the sustainer of all, and that therefore all 
provision or sustenance comes from Him. Mary being attached to the Temple, the 
worshippers would naturally bring gifts to her, and as it was through Divine grace 
that she received these gifts she said that it was Allah Who gave her these things. 

b (39-1) The Arabic word for John is Yahya, this name indicating that he 
would not die in sin like his other relations. 

c (39-2) The promise given to Zacharias was a word from Allah, and John 
was the verifier of that word, because his birth brought about the fulfilment of the 
prophecy. A word from Allah, therefore, stands for a Divine prophecy; see also 
6:34 and 10:64. 

rf(43) After speaking of Mary's birth and her growing up, the Quran now 
speaks of her election just as the righteous before her were elected. Evidently this 
refers to a time when she had grown up to the age of puberty and left the temple. 



80 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 45 

unseen which We reveal to you. And you were not with them 
when they cast their pens (to decide) which of them should have 
Mary in his charge, and you were not with them when they con- 
tended with one another." 

45 When the angels said: O Mary, surely Allah gives you 
good news with a word from Him (of one) whose name is the 
Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, c worthy of regard in this world and 
the Hereafter, and one of those who are drawn near (to Allah), 
46 and he will speak to the people when in the cradle and when of 
old age, and (he will be) one of the good ones. 47 She said: My 
Lord, how can I have a son and man has not yet touched me? He 
said: Even so; Allah creates what He pleases. When He decrees a 
matter, He only says to it, Be, and it is. e 



a (44) This verse cannot refer back to Mary's history as a child in the temple, 
as some think. The Quran has described her history in the natural order: her con- 
ception (v. 35), birth (v. 36), being dedicated to and residing in the temple (v. 37), 
and her election at the age of discretion (v. 42 and 43). Therefore this particular 
incident refers to her espousal. The casting of lots and the contention as to who 
should have her in his charge means her charge as a wife. 

b (45-1) The good news was given by means of a prophetic word from God. 

c (45-2) The Quran makes no mention at all of Mary's husband, but nor does 
it at all mention Moses' father when relating the circumstances of Moses' birth. 
The mere fact, therefore, that there is no mention of Jesus' father is not sufficient 
to show that Jesus had no father. Moreover, of his two parents Joseph and Mary, 
Mary was undoubtedly much more well-known than Joseph. 

d (46) Speaking "when in the cradle and when of old age" cannot be consi- 
dered as miracles, as the latter is undoubtedly not. The good news conveyed con- 
sists in the fact that the child announced will be a healthy child and shall not die 
in childhood. It would thus appear that, according to the Holy Quran, Jesus did 
not die at thirty-three years of age, but lived to a sufficiently old age. 

e (47) She is told in reply to her question that the child will be born because 
God would bring about the circumstances which result in the birth of a child. The 
words do not show that she would conceive out of the ordinary course of nature, 
for there is no doubt that Mary had other children, which no one supposes to have 
been conceived out of the ordinary course of nature. Nor do the words that follow 
prove anything beyond the simple fact that Mary must give birth to a son in accor- 
dance with the prophecy. The whole of creation is brought about, we are told 
again and again, by the Divine word "Be" (see 2:117), yet no one supposes that 
creation is not brought about according to the laws of nature. 



3:48* BIRTH OF JESUS AND HIS MINISTRY 8 1 

48 And He will teach him the Book and the Wisdom and the 
Torah and the Gospel, 49 and (make him) a messenger to the Child- 
ren of Israel (saying): I have come to you with a sign from your 
Lord, that I determine for you out of dust the form of a bird, then I 
breathe into it and it becomes a bird with Allah's permission, and 
I heal the blind and the leprous, and bring the dead to life e with 
Allah's permission; and I inform you of what you should eat and 
what you should store in your houses. Surely there is a sign in 
this for you, if you are believers. 50 And (I have come) verifying 
what is (already) before me of the Torah, and I allow you part of 
what was forbidden to you; 6 and I have come to you with a sign 
from your Lord, so keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 51 Surely 
Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so serve Him. This is the right 
path. 



a (49-1) As Jesus spoke in parables, this passage must be taken allegorically. 
What is meant is that Jesus, by breathing a spirit into mortals, will make them rise 
above those who are bent low upon the earth, and the apostles of Jesus, who were 
all men of humble origin (which is referred to in the word dust in the parable), left 
everything for the master's sake and went into the world by his command to 
preach the truth. Here was mere dust having the form of a bird, which the messen- 
ger of God converted into high-soaring birds by breathing truth into them. 

b (49-2) The Quran gives an explanation of the healing of the sick when, 
speaking of itself, it says that it is "a healing for what is in the hearts" (10:57), i.e. 
for spiritual diseases. A prophet's healing is spiritual, not healing of physical dis- 
eases. The Quran speaks of the blind and the deaf frequently, but it never means 
those who do not possess the senses of seeing and hearing. 

c (49-3) The Quran says plainly that those who die are not sent back to this 
world; see 39:42 and 23:100. But the use of the word mauta, i.e. the dead, and of 
their being raised to life, is frequent in the Quran in a spiritual sense: "Is he who 
was dead, then We raised him to life . . . like him whose likeness is that of one in 
darkness" (6:122). And again: "O you who believe, respond to Allah and His 
Messenger, when He calls you to that which gives you life" (8:24). The prophets 
are raised only for quickening to life those who are spiritually dead, and it is to 
this quickening through Jesus that the Quran refers here. 

d (49-4) Jesus laid special stress on not having any care "for the morrow", 
and advised a rich man when he came to him to sell all he had. He would have 
them lay up treasures in heaven. The verse refers to this aspect of his teaching. 

e (50) The law of Moses was upheld by the Israelite prophets, but amended 
from time to time. These changes are particularly marked out in Jesus' teaching. 



82 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 52 

52 But when Jesus perceived disbelief on their part, he said: 
Who will be my helpers in Allah's way? The disciples said: We 
are Allah's helpers, we believe in Allah, and (ask you to) bear 
witness that we are submitting ones. 53 0ur Lord, we believe in 
what You have revealed and we follow the messenger, so write us 
down with those who bear witness. 54 And (the Jews) planned and 
Allah (also) planned. And Allah is the Best of planners." 

Section 6: Jesus cleared of False Charges 

55 When Allah said: O Jesus, I will cause you to die* and 
exalt you in My presence c and clear you of those who disbelieve 
and make those who follow you above those who disbelieve to the 
day of Resurrection. 6 Then to Me is your return, so I shall decide 
between you in that in which you differ.' 56 Then as to those who 
disbelieve, I shall punish them with severe punishment in this world 



a (54) The word makr used here is the equivalent of the word plan, the good 
or evil nature of the plan being dependent on the doer's intention. The Jews plan- 
ned to put Jesus to death by crucifixion, and Allah made a plan to frustrate their 
plans; and Allah's plan was successful, i.e. he was saved from death on the cross, 
for which see 3:55 and 4: 157. 

b (55-1) Ibn Abbas says that the words used here, mutawafji-ka, mean 
mumltu-ka, i.e. I will cause you to die (see Bukhari, 65.5:12). These words are 
used to show that the Jewish plans to cause Jesus' death on the cross would be 
frustrated and that he would afterwards die a natural death; see 4:157. 

c (55-2) The word raf signifies raising or elevating, and also exalting or 
making honourable. When the raf of a human being to Allah is spoken of in the 
religious literature of Islam, it is always in the sense of exaltation. The exaltation 
of Jesus is mentioned here as a reply to the Jews, whose object was to make him 
die an accursed and ignominious death on the cross. 

rf(55-3) This signifies clearing Jesus of the false charges relating to the 
alleged illegitimacy of his birth, and so on, charges of which Jesus was cleared by 
the Quran. 

e (55-4) This is the fourth promise made to Jesus in this verse, that those 
who follow Jesus shall be made dominant over his rejectors till the day of Judg- 
ment. Its truth is witnessed to this day in the dominance of the Christians over the 
Jews. 

/(55-5) Differences of belief are dealt with in the life after death, while the 
worst of transgressions in deeds are punished even in this life. 



3:57* JESUS CLEARED OF FALSE CHARGES 83 

and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. 57 And as to those 
who believe and do good deeds, He will pay them fully their 
rewards. And Allah does not love the unjust. 

58 This We recite to you of the messages and the Reminder 
full of wisdom. 59 The likeness of Jesus with Allah is truly as the 
likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then said to him, Be, 
and he was." 60 (This is) the truth from your Lord, so do not be one 
of the disputers. ^Whoever then disputes with you in this matter 
after the knowledge that has come to you, say: Come! Let us call 
our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our 
people and your people, then let us be earnest in prayer, and invoke 
the curse of Allah on the liars. 62 Surely this is the true account, 
and there is no god but Allah. And Allah, He surely is the Mighty, 
the Wise. 63 But if they turn away, then surely Allah knows the 
mischief-makers . 

Section 7: Controversy with Jews and Christians 

64 Say: O People of the Book, come to an equitable word 
between us and you, that we shall serve none but Allah and that 
we shall not set up any partner with Him, and that some of us shall 



a (59) Adam stands for man generally, because all human beings are created 
from dust (see 18:37, 22:5 and 30:20). All that is meant is that Jesus is no more 
than a mortal, and that it is an error to take him for God. If Adam is taken as a 
proper name, the meaning would be that just as Adam was created from dust and 
then chosen by Allah, so was Jesus created from dust, and his election was similar 
to the election of Adam, the command "Be" referring to the election of a right- 
eous servant of Allah. In either case there is no reference to Jesus being brought 
into existence without the agency of a male parent. 

b (61) The persons addressed in particular in this verse are the members of 
the Christian deputation from Najran that came in 10 A.H. to see the Prophet 
Muhammad. The deputation was lodged by the Holy Prophet in his mosque. Thus 
did he set an unparalleled example of freedom of religious belief and practice. 
After the Holy Prophet gave them arguments showing that Jesus was not God, and 
finding them still insisting on their false belief, they were invited as a last resort to 
pray earnestly that the curse of Allah might overtake the party that insisted on 
falsehood. After some deliberation they decided against it and told the Prophet 
that they had decided not to pray against him as suggested. Thereupon they were 
given a pledge by which they were free to practise their religion. 



84 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 65 

not take others for lords besides Allah. But if they turn away, then 
say: Bear witness, we are Muslims." 65 People of the Book, why 
do you dispute about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel 
were not revealed till after him? Do you not understand? 66 Look! 
You are they who disputed about that of which you had know- 
ledge; why then do you dispute about that of which you have no 
knowledge? And Allah knows while you do not know.* 67 Abraham 
was not a Jew nor a Christian, but he was (an) upright (man), a 
Muslim; and he was not of those who set up partners (with Allah). 
68 The nearest of people to Abraham are surely those who follow him 
and this Prophet and those who believe. And Allah is the Friend of 
the believers. 

69 Some of the People of the Book desire that they should 
lead you astray; and they lead astray only themselves, but they do 
not perceive. 70 O People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in 
the messages of Allah while you witness (their truth)? 71 People 
of the Book, why do you mix the truth with falsehood, and hide 
the truth while you know? 

Section 8: Machinations to discredit Islam 

72 And a group of the People of the Book say: Affirm belief 
in what has been revealed to those who believe, in the first part of 



a (64) In this verse the Jews and the Christians are called upon to accept the 
broad principles of the faith of Abraham, which were also the basic principles of 
the faith of Islam. The words some of us shall not take others for lords is to the 
practice prevailing then both among Jews and Christians, and at present among 
Muslims too, to treat religious leaders as if invested with Divine powers. The basic 
doctrines of Islam are the greatest common measure of the truth contained in 
different religions of the world. The doctrine of Unity as taught by Islam affords 
an illustration. All higher religions start on the basis of Divine Unity but then each 
religious system has its peculiarities unknown to all others. Islam alone is free 
from all these additions to the basic doctrine, and it preaches Unity in its simplest 
form. There are no idols, no gods, no incarnations of the Divine Being, no sons of 
God, and finally no priests or clerics to be followed blindly. 

b (66) The Jews invited people to a belief in the Torah and the Christians to 
a belief in the Gospel, but both these had lost the purity of the faith of Abraham 
which was pure monotheism, unmixed with either Jewish priesthood or Christian 
doctrine of sonship. 



3 : 73 • MACHINATIONS TO DISCREDIT ISLAM 85 

the day, and disbelieve in the latter part of it, perhaps they may 
turn back." 73 And do not believe except in him who follows your 
religion. Say: True guidance — Allah's guidance — is that one 
may be given the like of what you were given; or they would 
prevail on you in argument before your Lord. e Say: Grace is 
surely in Allah's hand. He gives it to whom He pleases. And Allah 
is Ample-giving, Knowing. 74 He specially chooses for His mercy 
whom He pleases. And Allah is the Lord of mighty grace. 

75 And among the People of the Book is he who, if you 
entrust him with a heap of wealth, would pay it back to you; and 
among them is he who, if you entrust him with a dinar, would not 
pay it back to you, unless you kept on demanding it. This is 
because they say there is no blame on us in the matter of the 
unlearned people and they forge a lie against Allah while they 
know. 6 76 No, whoever fulfils his promise and keeps his duty — 
then Allah surely loves the dutiful. 77 Those who take a small price 
for the covenant of Allah and their own oaths — they have no 
portion in the Hereafter, and Allah will not speak to them, nor will 



a (72) This has two different significances. One is that they should affirm 
belief in the earlier part of the revelation, while denying the latter portion, as some 
modern critics do, thus creating doubts as to the sincerity of the Prophet. The 
other is that they should affirm a belief in the truth of Islam in the morning and 
deny it in the evening, creating the impression that the religion of Islam was a 
false religion. The fact that a group of Jews, in Madinah under Muslim rule, could 
conceive this plan is a clear proof that apostates in Islam were not put to death. 

b (73-1) Editor's Note: This is the statement of the Jews continued from v. 
72, that they should not believe in any prophet who did not follow their religion. 

c (73-2) The contention of the Jews not to believe in any prophet who did 
not follow the law of Moses is met with the reply that a revelation must be given 
to another prophet like the revelation that had been given to Moses, for the Divine 
promise to Moses was that God would raise up a prophet like him from among the 
"brethren" of the Israelites (Deuteronomy, 18:18). In this argument the Muslims 
are said to prevail over their opponents. 

d (74) Allah's choosing for His mercy stands here for His choice of a 
prophet. 

e (75) They considered themselves free from all responsibility towards the 
Arabs, despite any agreement they might have made with them. They are, how- 
ever, told that God never allowed dishonesty against any people. 



86 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 78 

He look upon them on the day of Resurrection, nor will He purify 
them, and for them is a painful punishment. 

78 And certainly there are some of them who lie about the 
Book that you may consider it to be (a part) of the Book while it is 
not (a part) of the Book; and they say, It is from Allah, while it is 
not from Allah; and they forge a lie against Allah while they 
know. 79 It is not for a mortal that Allah should give him the Book 
and the judgment and the prophethood, then he should tell people: 
Be my servants besides Allah's; but (he would say): Be worship- 
pers of the Lord because you teach the Book and because you 
study (it); 80 nor would he command you to take the angels and the 
prophets for lords." Would he command you to disbelieve after 
you submit? 

Section 9: Covenant of the Prophets 

81 And when Allah made a covenant through the prophets: 
Certainly what I have given you of Book and Wisdom — then a 
Messenger comes to you verifying what is (already) with you, you 
shall believe in him, and you shall aid him. He said: Do you 
affirm and accept My compact in this (matter)? They said: We do 
affirm. He said: Then bear witness, and I (too) am a bearer of wit- 
ness with you. 82 Whoever then turns back after this, these are the 
transgressors. 83 Do they then seek other than Allah's religion? 
And to Him submits whoever is in the heavens and the earth, 



a (80) Thus according to the Quran no prophet — Jesus included — ever 
taught his followers to take him as God. Even the current Gospels do not attribute 
any such teaching to Jesus. The angels are mentioned because the pagan Arabs 
worshipped the angels. 

b (81) The covenant was made through the prophets with their people. Both 
Moses and Jesus specially laid an obligation on their people to accept the prophet 
about whom they prophesied (see, for instance, Deuteronomy 18:18 and John 
16:13). In fact, all the prophets of the world foretold the advent of the Prophet 
Muhammad. The covenant was made through each prophet separately as he 
appeared in the world. And just as all the prophets foretold the advent of the 
Prophet Muhammad and laid an obligation upon their people to accept him, so the 
Prophet Muhammad also taught his followers to believe in all the prophets that 
had appeared among different people in different ages, and this is stated in v. 84. 



3 : 84 • COVENANT OF THE PROPHETS 87 

willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will be returned. 

84 Say: We believe in Allah and (in) what is revealed to us, 
and (in) what was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and 
Jacob and the tribes, and (in) what was given to Moses and Jesus 
and to the prophets from their Lord; we make no distinction 
between any of them, and to Him we submit. 85 And whoever seeks 
a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him, and in 
the Hereafter he will be one of the losers. 

86 How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their 
believing, and (after) they had borne witness that the Messenger 
was true, and clear arguments had come to them? And Allah does 
not guide the unjust peopled 87 As for these, their reward is that on 
them is the curse of Allah and the angels and of people, all 
together — ""abiding in it. Their punishment shall not be lightened, 
nor shall they be given respite — 89 except those who repent after 
that and amend, for surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 90 Those 
who disbelieve after their believing, then increase in disbelief, 
their repentance is not accepted, and these are they that go astray. 
91 Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, the earth 
full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them, though he 
should offer it as ransom. These it is for whom is a painful punish- 
ment, and they shall have no helpers. 



a (83) Compare 13:15, 22:18, etc., where it is said that all those who are in 
the heavens and the earth make submission to Allah. The verse, in fact, shows that 
Islam, or the rule of submission to Divine law, is a law which is seen working 
throughout nature, and this is an argument of the truth of the religion of Islam. 

b (85) The cosmopolitan nature of the religion of Islam having been clearly 
set forth in the previous verse, it is now stated that anyone who refused to accept 
such principles would unfailingly lose in the end. A Muslim accepts the whole 
truth, the truth as revealed to any prophet anywhere in the world, the truth as 
revealed to all mankind. 

c (86) The persons meant are those who believed in the former prophets and 
disbelieved in the Holy Prophet Muhammad. Having clear signs of the Prophet's 
truth with them, and professing a belief in the prophets who had foretold the advent 
of the last of the prophets, they still disbelieved in him. 






88 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 92 

Section 10: Ever-living Testimony to Truth of Islam 

92 You cannot attain to righteousness unless you spend (on 
good works) out of what you love." And what you spend, Allah 
surely knows it. 93 A11 food was lawful to the Children of Israel, 
before the Torah was revealed, except what Israel forbade himself. 
Say: Bring the Torah and read it, if you are truthful. 94 So who- 
ever forges a lie against Allah after this, these are the wrongdoers. 

95 Say: Allah speaks the truth; so follow the religion of 
Abraham, the upright one. And he was not one of those who set 
up partners (with Allah). 96 Certainly the first house appointed for 
mankind is the one at Bakkah, c blessed and a guidance for the 
nations. 97 In it are clear signs: (It is) the Place of Abraham; and 
whoever enters it is safe; and pilgrimage to the House is a duty 
which people owe to Allah — whoever can find a way to it. e And 



a (92) The connection with the last verse is clear. No wealth will buy 
redemption for a person if he has wasted his opportunity here, and to make the 
best of that opportunity a person must spend here what he loves most. 

b (93) The Jews objected to the Muslims making use of certain foods which 
the law of Moses did not allow. An answer is given here that such foods were 
lawful for Abraham and his descendants, and Islam agreed in principle with the 
religion of Abraham. By all food is meant all food made lawful for Muslims. 

c (96-1) Bakkah is the same as Makkah (Mecca). The Temple at Jerusalem 
was erected long after Abraham, while the Holy House at Makkah was there even 
before Abraham, and was, in fact, the first House on earth for the worship of the 
Divine Being. 

d (96-2) The word mubarak, rendered as blessed, signifies the continuance 
forever of the blessings which a thing possesses. Thus Makkah is not only the first 
spiritual centre for mankind but also the ultimate spiritual centre for the whole of 
humanity. 

e (97) There are three signs or prophecies here with regard to the future of 
Makkah. The first sign is that it is the Place of Abraham and hence the first 
prophecy is that the doctrine of the Unity of God will be proclaimed to the whole 
world from this centre. The second sign is that Makkah will always be secure, i.e., 
it shall not fall into the hands of an enemy who should destroy it. Thus its security 
is assured both physically and spiritually. The third prophecy is that a pilgrimage 
to the Sacred House shall continue to be made forever, and no power in the world 
shall ever be able to put a stop to it. The most striking fact about these prophecies 
is that they were all announced at a time when the Prophet and his followers had

whoever disbelieves, surely Allah is above need of the worlds. 

98 Say: O People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in the 
messages of Allah? And Allah is a witness of what you do. "Say: 
O People of the Book, why do you hinder those who believe from 
the way of Allah, seeking (to make) it crooked, while you are 
witnesses? And Allah is not heedless of what you do. 100 O you 
who believe, if you obey some of those who have been given the 
Book, they will turn you back as disbelievers after your belief. 
101 And how can you disbelieve while to you are recited the mess- 
ages of Allah, and among you is His Messenger? And whoever 
holds fast to Allah, he indeed is guided to a right path. 

Section 1 1 : Muslims exhorted to remain United 

102 O you who believe, keep your duty to Allah, as it ought 
to be kept, and do not die except as Muslims." 103 And hold fast by 
the covenant of Allah all together and do not be disunited. And 
remember Allah's favour to you when you were enemies, then He 
united your hearts so by His favour you became brethren. And you 
were on the brink of a pit of fire, then He saved you from it. e Thus 
Allah makes clear to you His messages that you may be guided. 
104 And from among you there should be a community who invite 

apparently been driven away forever from the Sacred Place, when that place was 
in the exclusive possession of an enemy who did not allow the Muslims to visit it, 
and when the small Muslim community was in danger of being utterly destroyed 
by that powerful enemy at any moment. 

a (102) The Muslims are exhorted, first to be individually conscious of the 
duty they owe to God (v. 1 02), and then to remain united in carrying the message 
of Islam to the whole world (v. 103). Every Muslim must live a life of true sub- 
mission to God, so that when death comes to him it should find him a Muslim. As 
v. 104 shows, the Muslim's great duty, to which attention is called here, is the 
carrying of the message of Islam to others. 

b (103-1) By the covenant of Allah is meant the Quran, a significance sup- 
ported by sayings of the Holy Prophet. All Muslims, we are here told, should be 
united in holding fast to the Quran and carrying its message to other people. 

c (103-2) Before the advent of the Holy Prophet, the Arabs were in a state of 
continual internecine warfare which threatened to devastate the whole country. He 
brought about the impossible of uniting all these factions. 



90 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 105 

to good and enjoin the right and forbid the wrong. And these are 
they who are successful." 105 And do not be like those who became 
divided and disagreed after clear arguments had come to them. 
And for them is a grievous punishment. 

106 On the day when (some) faces will brighten and (some) 
faces will darken. Then as to those whose faces are darkened: Did 
you disbelieve after your belief? So taste the punishment because 
you disbelieved. 107 And as to those whose faces are brightened, 
they shall be in Allah's mercy. In it they shall abide. 108 These are 
the messages of Allah which We recite to you with truth. And Allah 
desires no injustice to (His) creatures. i° 9 And to Allah belongs 
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And to 
Allah are all affairs returned. 

Section 12: Relations of Muslims with Jews 

110 You are the best nation raised up for mankind: you enjoin 
good and forbid evil and you believe in Allah. And if the People 
of the Book had believed, it would have been better for them. 
Some of them are believers but most of them are transgressors. 
m They will not harm you except a slight hurt. And if they fight 
you, they will turn (their) backs to you. Then they will not be 
helped. ^Degradation will be their lot wherever they are found, 



a (104) This verse and 9:122 both direct Muslims to have always among 
them a missionary group, whose only object should be the propagation of Islam 
and rightly directing their own people. This is the most neglected injunction of the 
Quran in our day. Muslims have arrangements for all other things but have no 
arrangements for inviting people to the great truth revealed in the Quran. 

b (106) By faces brightening is meant their being expressive of joy, and by 
their darkening is meant their being expressive of regret. (Editor's Note: Physical 
colour of skin, white or black, is not meant here; compare 16:58: "And when the 
birth of a daughter is announced to one of them, his face becomes dark".) 

c (110) The excellence of the Muslim people lies in their enjoining good and 
forbidding evil and in their great faith in Allah. If they lose these characteristics, 
they lose their excellence as well. Their excellence was no doubt due to the 
excellence of that Great Teacher who thoroughly purified them of the worst vices 
and made perfect the light within them. 



3:113' RELATIONS OF MUSLIMS WITH JEWS 91 

except under a covenant with Allah and a covenant with people," 
and they shall incur the wrath of Allah, and humiliation will be 
made to cling to them. This is because they disbelieved in the 
messages of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly. This is because 
they disobeyed and exceeded the limits. 113 They are not all alike. 
Of the People of the Book some are upright — they recite Allah's 
messages in the night-time and they adore (Him). n4 They believe 
in Allah and the Last Day, and they enjoin good and forbid evil 
and hasten in (doing) good deeds. And those are among the right- 
eous. 115 And whatever good they do, they will not be denied it. 
And Allah knows those who keep their duty. 

116 Those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children 
will avail them at all against Allah. And these are the companions 
of the Fire; in it they abide. 117 The likeness of what they spend in 
the life of this world is as the likeness of wind in which is intense 
cold; it strikes the harvest of a people who are unjust to them- 
selves and destroys it. And Allah did not wrong them but they 
wronged themselves. n8 you who believe, do not take for intimate 
friends others than your own people: they spare no pains to cause 
you loss. c They love whatever distresses you. Vehement hatred has 
already appeared from out of their mouths, and what their hearts 
conceal is greater still. Indeed We have made the messages clear 
to you, if you understand. 119 Look! You are the ones who will love 
them while they do not love you, and you believe in the Book, 



a (112) The Jews had already been subjected to disgrace before the appear- 
ance of the Prophet. But with the advent of Islam they could better their condition 
either by accepting the covenant of Allah, by which is meant the acceptance of 
Islam, or by making a compact of security with such people as could give them 
protection. This remains true to this day. 

b (115) These verses speak of the good among the Jews and the Christians. 
The Quran does not deny that there is good in others, its own eminence lying in 
the fact that it makes man attain the highest degree of perfection in goodness. 
Thus the description of the upright among the followers of the Book concludes 
with the words: whatever good they do, they will not be denied it. 

c (118) As the context shows, these people made war on the Muslims and 
wished to cause them loss. Hence Muslims could not be friendly with them. 

d (119) This verse clearly indicates the difficulties which the Muslims had in

(in) the whole of it. And when they meet you they say, We believe, 
and when they are alone, they bite (their) finger tips in rage against 
you. Say: Die in your rage. Surely Allah is Knower of what is in 
the hearts. 120 If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if an evil 
afflicts you, they rejoice at it. And if you are patient and keep your 
duty, their struggle will not injure you in any way. Surely Allah 
encompasses what they do. 

Section 13: The Battle of Uhud 

121 And when you went forth early in the morning from your 
family, to assign to the believers their positions for the battle. a 
And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 122 When two parties from among 
you thought of showing cowardice, and Allah was the Guardian of 
them both. And in Allah should the believers trust. 123 And Allah 
certainly helped you at Badr when you were weak. So keep your 
duty to Allah that you may give thanks. 

124 When you said to the believers: Is it not sufficient for you 
that your Lord should help you with three thousand angels sent 
down? * 125 Indeed, if you are steadfast and keep your duty, and 

establishing friendly and loving relations with non-Muslims. The Muslims would 
offer friendship, but the other party was always on the look-out for some oppor- 
tunity to inflict loss on them. 

a (121) Much of the rest of this chapter is devoted to the events of the battle 
of Uhud. In 3 A.H. the Quraish marched against Madinah. The Prophet at first in- 
tended to stay within the town, but afterwards marched into the open field with a 
thousand men, one-third of whom, under the leadership of Abdullah ibn Ubayy, 
the hypocrite leader, left him and returned to Madinah. The enemy were first 
completely routed, but fifty Muslim archers, who were placed in a strong position 
to cut off the retreat of the enemy, made a mistake, and in order to join in the pur- 
suit left their position. The enemy fell back upon the Muslims who were now in 
disorder and had lost their naturally fortified position, and after inflicting some 
loss upon them, left the field secure from the pursuit of the Muslim force. It was 
not a victory for the Quraish, who thought it safe to go back when they found the 
Muslims involved in their own troubles. They could not take a single prisoner of 
war, nor had they the courage to attack Madinah, which they did two years later 
with a very strong force. 

b (124) The promise of the coming of angels is fully explained in the 8th 
chapter in connection with the battle of Badr. As here, it is first stated there that 



3:126' THE BATTLE OF UHUD 93 

they come upon you in a headlong manner, your Lord will assist 
you with five thousand of havoc-making angels." 126 And Allah 
made it only as good news for you, and that your hearts might be 
at ease by it. And help comes only from Allah, the Mighty, the 
Wise, 127 that He may cut off a part of those who disbelieve or 
humble them so that they should return in failure. 128 You have no 
concern in the matter whether He turns to them (mercifully) or 
punishes them; surely they are wrongdoers/ 129 And to Allah 
belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. 
He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. 
And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

Section 14: What Success meant for Muslims 

130 O you who believe, do not devour usury, doubling and 
redoubling, and keep your duty to Allah, that you may be success- 
ful. 131 And guard yourselves against the fire which has been 



the promise was given only "as good news, and that your hearts might be at ease 
by it" (8:10). Then it is made further clear there that the believers were strength- 
ened and made firm while terror was cast into the hearts of their enemy. This was 
the result of the action of the angels upon the hearts. 

a (125) The assistance of the angels stated in this verse refers to a third occa- 
sion, when the enemy came "in a headlong manner", all the tribes uniting with the 
Quraish to crush the Muslims. This happened in the battle of Ahzab, or the Allies, 
when the Quraish, numbering about five thousand, with the help of allied forces, 
the total strength being more than ten thousand, suddenly attacked Madinah. The 
dispersal of such a large army when the Muslims were only about fourteen hund- 
red was no doubt due to Divine help, sent through angelic hosts. 

b (127) Although the object of the disbelievers was to extirpate the Muslims 
by war, God's aim was not to destroy all the disbelievers by defeat but to cut off 
their ringleaders and chiefs. The word translated as "a part", taraf, also means the 
leading men. When the leaders of mischief were cut off, the rest would be dis- 
appointed of attaining the object of extirpating Islam, and persecution would 
cease. 

c (128) As a mortal the Prophet might have sometimes desired a severe 
punishment for his enemies; but he is told that it was not his concern, for Allah 
might as well forgive them, even though they deserved punishment. The all- 
comprehensiveness of the Divine mercy expressed in this verse is unapproached 
in sacred literature.

prepared for the disbelievers." 132 And obey Allah and the Messen- 
ger, that you may be shown mercy. 

133 And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden, 
as wide as the heavens and the earth; it is prepared for those who 
keep their duty: 134 Those who spend in ease as well as in adversity 
and those who restrain (their) anger and pardon people. And Allah 
loves the doers of good (to others). 135 And those who, when they 
commit an indecency or wrong their souls, remember Allah and 
ask forgiveness for their sins. And who forgives sins but Allah? 
And they do not persist knowingly in what they do. 136 Their reward 
is protection from their Lord, and Gardens in which rivers flow, to 
abide in them. And excellent is the reward of the workers! 

137 Indeed there have been examples before you; so travel in 
the earth and see what was the end of the deniers. i 38 This is a clear 
statement for mankind, and a guidance and an admonition to those 
who would keep their duty. 139 And do not be weak-hearted, nor 
grieve, and you will have the upper hand if you are believers. 140 If 
a wound has afflicted you, a wound like it has also afflicted the 
(disbelieving) people. And We bring these days to people by turns, 
that Allah may know e those who believe and (He may) take wit- 
nesses from among you. And Allah does not love the wrongdoers, 
141 and that He may purge those who believe and deprive the 
disbelievers of blessings. 142 Do you think that you will enter the 
Garden while Allah has not yet known those from among you who 
strive hard (nor) known the steadfast? 143 And certainly you desired 
death before you met it. So indeed you have seen it now as you 
look/ 



a (131) The fire in this case is excessive love of wealth. See chapter 104. 

b (134) Restraining of anger, pardoning, and doing good to others, besides 
being great moral qualities, strengthen the bond of union which is so necessary for 
success. The verse has on many occasions inspired Muslims with the noblest 
thoughts of toleration and charitableness. 

c (140) Allah knows all that is seen or unseen. The knowing here and the not 
knowing in v. 142 refer to the knowledge of the event actually having taken place. 

d (143) This refers to the desire of those who insisted that they should meet 
the enemy in the open field, while the Holy Prophet's own desire was that the 
Muslims should defend themselves within Madinah. 



3 : 144 • SUFFERINGS TO BE MET WITH PERSEVERANCE 95 

Section 15: Sufferings to be met with Perseverance 

144 And Muhammad is but a messenger — messengers have 
already passed away before him. If then he dies or is killed, will 
you turn back upon your heels? " And he who turns back upon his 
heels will do no harm at all to Allah. And Allah will reward the 
grateful. 145 And no soul can die but with Allah's permission — the 
term is fixed. And whoever desires the reward of this world, We 
give him of it, and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, 
We give him of it. And We shall reward the grateful. 

146 And how many a prophet has fought, with whom were 
many worshippers of the Lord. So they did not lose heart on 
account of what befell them in Allah's way, nor did they weaken, 
nor did they disgrace themselves. And Allah loves the steadfast. 
147 And their cry was only that they said: Our Lord, grant us pro- 
tection from our sins and our extravagance in our affair, and make 
firm our feet and grant us victory over the disbelieving people. 
148 So Allah gave them the reward of the world and a good reward 
of the Hereafter. And Allah loves the doers of good (to others). 

Section 16: Causes of Misfortune in Battle of Uhud 

149 O you who believe, if you obey those who disbelieve, 
they will make you turn back upon your heels, so you will turn 
back losers. 150 Rather, Allah is your Patron, and He is the Best of 



a (144) The Prophet received severe wounds in the battle of Uhud; there was 
even a rumour that he was killed. Even if the Prophet were killed, Islam was so 
far superior to all forms of faith that the Muslims could not give up Islam. This 
verse served another important purpose at the death of the Prophet. Some of the 
Companions thought that he was not dead. Abu Bakr went in, and seeing that life 
had departed, ascended the pulpit and read this verse, which had a magical effect 
upon his hearers, all of them being convinced that the Prophet had passed away, 
as all prophets had passed away before him. The prophets were but mortals, and 
their span of mortal life must no doubt terminate like that of other mortals. This 
verse affords a conclusive proof that Jesus was also dead; otherwise Abu Bakr's 
argument could not have silenced the doubters of the Prophet's death. 

b (149) The war was carried on only with the object of making the Muslims 
renounce their religion, and hence they could not think of accepting the disbelie- 
vers as their rulers. 



96 3 . THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 1 5 1 

the helpers. 151 We will cast terror into the hearts of those who 
disbelieve a because they set up partners with Allah for which He 
has sent down no authority, and their abode is the Fire. And evil is 
the abode of the wrongdoers. 

152 And Allah certainly made good His promise to you when 
you slew them by His permission, until you became weak-hearted 
and disputed about the affair and disobeyed after He had shown 
you what you loved. Some of you desired this world, and some of 
you desired the Hereafter. Then He turned you away from them 
that He might try you; and He has indeed pardoned you. c And 
Allah is Gracious to the believers. 153 When you went away far, 
and paid no heed to anyone, and the Messenger was calling you in 
your rear. So He gave you (another) grief for (your) first grief 
that you might not grieve at what escaped you, nor (at) what befell 
you. And Allah is Aware of what you do. 



a (151) The Muslims were less than one-fourth of their opponents, being at 
the same time not so well equipped as their foes, and in spite of the disorder into 
which the Muslim forces had fallen, the enemy had to flee, leaving the Muslims in 
the field, not even making a show of attacking Madinah, which was quite defence- 
less. This clearly shows that they were terror-stricken. 

b (152-1) The weak-heartedness of a part of the archers who were placed in 
an important position to cut off the enemy's retreat consisted in their disobeying 
the clear orders of the Prophet: "If you see us overcoming the enemy do not leave 
your position, and if you see the enemy overcoming us, do not leave your posi- 
tion". But they fell a prey to the love of the world and left their position to get a 
share in the booty when they saw the enemy fleeing before the Muslim onrush. 

c (152-2) The enemy, who was being pursued, turned against the pursuers on 
seeing the important position of the archers vacated, and the result was that the 
Muslims who were now in disorder on account of the pursuit found themselves 
helpless against the enemy who turned back on them, and some of them who were 
cut off from the main body took to flight. However, God pardoned them as their 
flight was the result of circumstances which were beyond their control. 

d (153) It refers to the Prophet's call, at whom the Muslims now saw that the 
attack of the enemy was directed. So they did not grieve for losing an opportunity 
of pursuing the enemy, but for the dangerous position in which they saw the 
Prophet. 



3:154' CAUSES OF MISFORTUNE IN BATTLE OF UHUD 97 

154 Then after grief He sent down security on you, slumber 
overcoming a group of you," while (there was) another group 
whom their own minds had made anxious — they entertained about 
Allah thoughts of ignorance quite unjustly. They said: Have we 
any hand in the affair? Say: The affair is wholly (in the hands) of 
Allah. They hide within themselves what they would not reveal to 
you. They say: If we had any hand in the affair, we would not have 
been slain here. c Say: Had you remained in your houses, those for 
whom slaughter was ordained would have gone forth to the places 
where they would be slain. And (this happened) that Allah might 
test what was in your minds and that He might purge what was in 
your hearts. And Allah is Knower of what is in the minds. 
i S5 Those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies 
met, only the devil sought to cause them to make a slip on account 
of some deeds they had done, and certainly Allah has pardoned 
them. Surely Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing. 6 



a (154-1) This happened when the enemy departed. The slumber was a sign 
of security. 

b (154-2) These were the disaffected who took no part in fighting. They now 
gave vent to their hidden rancour against the Muslims. The evil thoughts which 
the hypocrites entertained about Allah were that Allah had not helped the 
Muslims. 

c (154-3) The hypocrites sided with the minority whose counsel was that the 
Muslims should not fight the enemy in the open field and should remain besieged 
in Madinah. The majority was, however, in favour of going out and meeting the 
enemy where it had encamped. The Prophet decided that the majority vote must 
be accepted. The hypocrites now argued that the disaster would not have befallen 
the Muslims if their advice as to remaining within the town had been accepted. 
They took no part in fighting but they spoke of the loss of the Muslims as their 
own loss. 

d (154-4) They are given the reply that even if the Muslims had defended 
themselves by remaining in Madinah, those who laid down their lives in the field 
of Uhud would have laid them down in Madinah as well. 

e (155) The persons spoken of here are those who were unable to join the 
main Muslim army and fled to Madinah, or in some other direction. It was a slip 
on their part, not intentional disobedience, and God granted them a free pardon. 



3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 156 



Section 17: Battle of Uhud afforded a Distinction 

156 O you who believe, do not be like those who disbelieve 
and say of their brethren when they travel in the earth or engage in 
fighting: If they had been with us, they would not have died, or 
been killed;" that Allah may make it a regret in their hearts. And 
Allah gives life and causes death. And Allah is Seer of what you 
do. 157 And if you are killed in Allah's way or you die, surely 
Allah's protection and (His) mercy are better than what they amass. 
158 And if you die or you are killed, to Allah you are gathered. 

159 Thus it is by Allah's mercy that you are gentle to them. 
And if you had been rough, hard-hearted, they would certainly 
have dispersed from around you. b So pardon them and ask protec- 
tion for them, and consult them in (important) matters/ But when 
you have determined, put jour trust in Allah. Surely Allah loves 
those who trust (in Him). 160 If Allah helps you, there is none that 
can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there that can 
help you after Him? And in Allah should the believers put their 
trust. 

161 And it is not for a prophet to act dishonestly. And who- 
ever acts dishonestly will bring his dishonesty on the day of 



a (156) By "their brethren" are meant their relatives who were sincere in 
professing Islam, and who had to lay down their lives in defence of their faith. 

b (159-1) The Quran calls attention to the Prophet's gentle dealing with those 
around him when speaking of his experience in the field of battle as a general, a 
capacity which required him to be very strict in punishing any delinquency. He 
was the ablest general in leading his men, yet his gentle manners and his 
forbearance in dealing with his friends as well as foes stand in remarkable 
contrast with his capacity as a commander in the field of battle. After the Uhud 
trouble he did not speak even a harsh word to those who were guilty of disobey- 
ing his orders. 

c (159-2) It was the majority decision to meet the enemy in the open field 
that had brought about the present trouble, but just at this juncture Divine revela- 
tion affirmed the principle of adhering to decision by counsel. 

d (159-3) Trusting in Allah does not imply inaction. Everything necessary is 
to be done. A course of action must be determined and then in pursuing that 
course trust must be placed in Allah. The consequences must then be accepted. 



3 : 1 62 • BATTLE OF UHUD AFFORDED A DISTINCTION 99 

Resurrection. Then shall every soul be paid back fully what it has 
earned, and they will not be wronged. 162 Is then he who follows 
the pleasure of Allah like him who incurs Allah's displeasure, and 
his abode is hell? And it is an evil destination. 163 There are grades 
with Allah. And Allah is Seer of what they do. 

164 Certainly Allah conferred a favour on the believers when 
He raised among them a Messenger from among themselves, reci- 
ting to them His messages and purifying them, and teaching them 
the Book and the Wisdom, although before that they were surely 
in manifest error. 165 What! When a misfortune befell you, and you 
had inflicted twice as much, you say: From where is this? Say: It 
is from yourselves. Surely Allah is Powerful over all things. 
166 And what befell you on the day when the two armies met was 
by Allah's permission, that He might know the believers, 167 and 
that He might know the hypocrites. And it was said to them: Come, 
fight in Allah's way, or defend yourselves." They said: If we knew 
fighting, we would have followed you. They were on that day 
nearer to disbelief than to belief; they say with their mouths what 
is not in their hearts. And Allah best knows what they conceal. 
168 Those who said of their brethren whilst they (themselves) held 
back: If they had obeyed us, they would not have been killed. Say: 
Avert death from yourselves, if you are truthful. 

169 And do not think of those who are killed in Allah's way 
as dead. Rather, they are alive being provided sustenance from 
their Lord, 170 rejoicing in what Allah has given them out of His 
grace, and they rejoice for the sake of those who, (being left) 
behind them, have not yet joined them, that they have no fear, nor 
shall they grieve. 171 They rejoice for Allah's favour and (His) 
grace, and that Allah does not waste the reward of the believers. 



a (167) The words show clearly that, in the language of the Quran, fighting 
in Allah 's way carries the significance of fighting in self-defence. 



100 3 . THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 1 72 

Section 18: Uhud no gain to the Enemy 

172 Those who responded to the call of Allah and the Messen- 
ger after the misfortune had befallen them — for such among 
them who do good and keep their duty is a great reward. 173 Those 
to whom people said: Surely men have gathered against you, so 
fear them; but this increased their faith, and they said: Allah is 
sufficient for us and He is an excellent Guardian. i 74 So they 
returned with favour from Allah and (His) grace; no evil touched 
them, and they followed the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the 
Lord of mighty grace. 175 It is the devil who only frightens his 
friends, but do not fear them, and fear Me, if you are believers. 

176 And do not let those grieve you who run into disbelief 
hastily; surely they can do no harm to Allah. Allah does not intend 
to assign them any portion in the Hereafter; and for them is a 
grievous punishment. 177 Those who buy disbelief at the price of 
faith can do no harm to Allah, and for them is a painful punish- 
ment. 178 And those who disbelieve should not think that our grant- 
ing them respite is good for themselves. We grant them respite 
only that they may add to their sins; and for them is a humiliating 
punishment. 179 Allah will not leave the believers in the condition 
in which you are until He separates the evil from the good. Nor is 
Allah going to make you acquainted with the unseen, but Allah 
chooses of His messengers whom He pleases. So believe in Allah 
and His messengers. And if you believe and keep your duty, you 
will have a great reward. 

180 And those who are miserly in spending what Allah has 
granted them out of His grace should not think that it is good for 
them. Rather, it is evil for them. They shall have a collar of their 
miserliness on their necks on the day of Resurrection." And Allah's 
is the heritage of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Aware of 
what you do. 



a (180) The same idea in more general terms, as to the effect of deeds being 
bound to the neck, is expressed in 17:13. Every person carries the effect of his 
deeds with him in this life, but on the day of Resurrection that effect will become 
clearly visible. 



3:181' CARPINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK 1 1 

Section 19: Carpings of the People of the Book 

181 Allah has certainly heard the saying of those who said: 
Allah is poor and we are rich. We shall record what they say, and 
their killing the prophets unjustly, and We shall say: Taste the 
punishment of burning." 182 This is for what your own hands have 
sent ahead, and because Allah is not in the least unjust to the ser- 
vants. 183 Those who say: Allah has enjoined us that we should not 
believe in any messenger until he brings us an offering which is 
consumed by fire.* Say: Indeed messengers came to you before 
me with clear arguments and with what you demand. Why then 
did you try to kill them, if you are truthful? e 184 But if they reject 
you, so indeed were rejected before you messengers who came 
with clear arguments and scriptures and the illuminating Book. 
185 Every soul must taste of death. And you will be paid your reward 
fully only on the day of Resurrection. Then whoever is removed 
far from the Fire and is made to enter the Garden, he indeed attains 
the object. And the life of this world is nothing but a provision of 
vanities. 

186 You will certainly be tried in your property and your 
persons. And you will certainly hear from those who have been 
given the Book before you and from the idolaters much abuse. 
And if you are patient and keep your duty, surely this is an affair 
of great resolution. 187 And when Allah took a covenant from 



a (181) The Jews ridiculed the poverty of the Muslims and their borrowings 
from the Jewish money-lenders. They also ridiculed the raising of funds for the 
defence of the faith by subscriptions. See also 5:64. 

b (183-1) They were referring to the burnt offerings of the Mosaic law. 

c (183-2) The critics are told that they even sought to kill those prophets who 
followed the Mosaic law, who came "with what you demand". 

d (186) This verse speaks of the future, in fact the distant future. The abuses 
which have been heaped on Islam in the past two centuries are without a parallel 
in the whole history of religion. The scurrilous language of Western publications, 
political as well as Christian, and the vituperations of their imitators elsewhere have 
exceeded all moral bounds. But Muslims are taught in this verse to bear all such 
abuse only with patience. (Editor's Note: Hence it is not at all required or even 
allowed in Islam that Muslims should respond by killing or physically attacking

those who were given the Book: You shall explain it to people and 
shall not hide it. But they threw it behind their backs and took a 
small price for it. And evil is what they buy. 188 Do not think that 
those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for 
what they have not done — do not think them to be safe from the 
punishment; and for them is a painful punishment. 189 And Allah's 
is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Power- 
ful over all things. 

Section 20: Ultimate Triumph of the Faithful 

190 In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alter- 
nation of the night and the day, there are surely signs for those 
who have understanding, 191 those who remember Allah, standing 
and sitting and (lying) on their sides, and reflect on the creation of 
the heavens and the earth: Our Lord, You have not created this in 
vain! Glory be to You! Save us from the punishment of the Fire. a 
192 0ur Lord, whomsoever You make enter the Fire, him You indeed 
bring to disgrace. And there will be no helpers for the wrongdoers. 
193 0ur Lord, surely we have heard a Crier calling to the faith, 
saying: Believe in your Lord. So we do believe. Our Lord, grant 
us protection from our sins and remove our evils and make us die 
with the righteous. 194 0ur Lord, grant us what You have promised 
us by Your messengers and do not disgrace us on the day of 
Resurrection. Surely You never fail in (Your) promise! 

195 So their Lord accepted their prayer, (saying): I will not let 
the work of any worker among you to be lost, whether male or 



those who vilify Islam and its Holy Prophet. See also 20:130, 33:48, 73:10, 4:140 
and 6:68 which lead to the same conclusion.) 

a (191) This chapter, like the one before it, ends with a prayer for the victory 
of Faith over disbelief and a prediction for its ultimate triumph. Verses 190-191 
describe true believers on the one hand as remembering God in the midst of all 
worldly pursuits, standing and sitting and lying on their sides, being thus fully 
conscious of the Divine presence in all conditions; and, on the other, they set out 
for the conquest of nature with the full consciousness that nothing has been crea- 
ted in vain and that a purpose underlies the whole of creation. This is the grand 
object which Islam sets before its followers, to conquer self by remembrance of 
God and to conquer nature by pursuit of knowledge.

female; each of you is as the other. So those who fled and were 
driven forth from their homes and persecuted in My way and who 
fought and were slain," I shall truly remove their evil and make 
them enter Gardens in which rivers flow — a reward from Allah. 
And with Allah is the best reward. 196 Do not let control in the 
land, of those who disbelieve, deceive you. 197 A brief enjoyment! 
Then their abode is hell. And evil is the resting-place. 198 But those 
who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are Gardens in which 
rivers flow, to abide therein; and entertainment from their Lord. 
And what Allah has in store for the righteous is best. 

199 And among the People of the Book are those who believe 
in Allah and (in) what has been revealed to you and (in) what has 
been revealed to them, humbling themselves before Allah — they 
do not take a small price for the messages of Allah. These it is that 
have their reward with their Lord. Surely Allah is Swift to take 
account! 200 O you who believe, be steadfast and try to excel in 
steadfastness and guard (the frontiers). And keep your duty to 
Allah that you may be successful. 



a (195) Editor's Note: This shows that Muslims were first made to flee, were 
driven from their homes, and were persecuted for worshipping the One God, by 
their enemies, and it was then that they fought in battles in which they were slain. 
And they fought only after war was made upon them; see 22:39-40, 2: 190. 

b (200) While victory is predicted for the Muslims, they are required to be 
humble in the hour of triumph, as at the close of the last chapter. The three quali- 
ties spoken of here, namely, steadfastness or endurance, trying to excel in stead- 
fastness, and guarding, carry a temporal as well as a spiritual significance. They 
require, on the one hand, showing endurance in wars, excelling the enemy in endu- 
rance and to remain in readiness on the frontiers of the Muslim territory to meet 
the enemy, and, on the other, remaining steadfast in keeping away from evil and 
in keeping to obedience to God, trying to excel each other in the quality of 
endurance and to remain on guard against the temptations of the devil. 



Chapter 4 
Ai-Nisa' Women 

This chapter deals chiefly with the rights of women. The battle of Uhud, dealt 
with in the last chapter, had left a large number of orphans and widows 
among the Muslims, and this chapter opens with the subject of duties towards 
them followed by rights of women generally. During the battle of Uhud the 
hypocrites had deserted the Muslims, and this chapter then deals with the 
subject of hypocrisy. Following the battle of Uhud had come the final rupture 
with the Jews as they had sided with the enemy, and the chapter towards its 
end speaks of their transgressions against the Israelite prophets and their 
allegations against Jesus. This chapter was mainly revealed in 4 A.H. 



Section 1 : Duties of Guardians to Orphans 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O people, keep your duty to your Lord, Who created you 
from a single being and created its mate of the same (kind)," and 
spread from these two many men and women.* And keep your 
duty to Allah, by Whom you demand one of another (your rights), 
and (to) the ties of relationship. Surely Allah is ever a Watcher 
over you. 



a (1-1) How the first man was created is not stated either in the Quran or in 
the Hadith, nor is the Bible statement accepted that Eve was created from a rib of 
Adam. Muslims do not accept that man was created six thousand years ago. There 
are traditions stating that there were many Adams, even hundreds of thousands of 
Adams, before our Adam. Nor do Muslims accept that our world is the only world 
in this universe; one Imam is reported as saying that in God's universe there are 
twelve thousand systems each bigger than our solar system. The words "Who 
created you from a single being and created its mate of the same" only declare the 
unity of the human race and the equality of the male and the female. Elsewhere 
we are told that for all of you wives are created from yourselves: 'And Allah has 
made wives for you from among yourselves" (16:72). 

b (1-2) "Many men and women" spring from married pairs. The verse does 
not necessarily refer to any parent pair of the whole of mankind. It reminds people 
of the strength of the ties of relationship, an idea mentioned in what follows. 



104 



4 : 2 • DUTIES OF GUARDIANS TO ORPHANS 105 

2 And give to orphans their property, and do not substitute 
worthless (things) for (their) good (ones), nor devour their pro- 
perty (adding) to your own property. This is surely a great sin. a 
3 And if you fear that you cannot do justice to orphans, marry such 
women as seem good to you, two, or three, or four; * but if you 
fear that you will not do justice, then (marry) only one or what 
your right hands possess. c This is more proper that you may not do 
injustice. 4 And give women their dowries as a free gift. But if they 
of themselves are pleased to give you a portion from it, consume it 
with enjoyment and pleasure/ 



a (2) The care of the orphan was one of the earliest injunctions that Islam 
gave, and the Prophet had always shown a deep anxiety for the welfare of the poor 
and the orphans; see 2:220 and 90:15-16. The subject is here introduced in detail 
because of the number of orphans having been greatly increased by the war. 

b (3-1) This passage permits polygamy under certain circumstances; it does 
not prescribe it, nor even permit it unconditionally. This chapter was revealed to 
guide the Muslims under the conditions which followed the battle of Uhud, and 
the last chapter deals with that battle. Now in that battle 70 men out of 700 
Muslims had been killed, and this had greatly decreased the number of males. The 
number was likely to diminish further still in the battles which had yet to be fought. 
Thus many orphans would be left in the charge of widows, who would find it 
difficult to procure the necessary means of support. Hence in the first verse of this 
chapter Muslims are enjoined to respect ties of relationship. As they all came from 
a single ancestor, a breadth is introduced into the idea of relationship. In the second 
verse the care of orphans is particularly stressed. In the third verse we are told that 
if they could not do justice to the orphans, they might marry the widows, whose 
children would thus become their own children; and as the number of women was 
now much greater than the number of men, they were permitted to marry even 
two or three or four women. The Holy Prophet's own action in marrying widows 
corroborates this statement. Marriage with orphan girls is also sanctioned in this 
passage, for there were the same difficulties in their case as in the case of widows, 
and the words are general. See also 4:127. It is not only the preponderance of 
females over males that necessitates polygamy in certain cases, but there is a 
variety of other circumstances, not only for the moral but also for the physical 
welfare of society. 

c (3-2) By what your right hands possess are meant the females who were 
taken prisoners in war. The Quran sanctions marriage with them in this verse. As 
for the conditions of that marriage, see 4:25. 

d (4) It is obligatory in Islam that a "dowry" or nuptial gift should be given 
by the husband to the wife at the time of marriage, whether she is a free woman, 



106 4. WOMEN «4:5 

5 And do not make over your property, which Allah has made 
a (means of) support for you, a to the weak of understanding, and 
maintain them out of it, and clothe them and give them a good 
education. 6 And test the orphans until they reach the age of 
marriage/ Then if you find in them maturity of intellect, make 
over to them their property, and do not consume it extravagantly 
and hastily against their growing up. And whoever is rich, let him 
abstain, and whoever is poor let him consume reasonably. And 
when you make over to them their property, call witnesses in their 
presence. And Allah is enough as a Reckoner. 

7 For men is a share of what the parents and the near relatives 
leave, and for women a share of what the parents and the near 



an orphan girl, or a prisoner of war. So every woman begins her married life as 
the owner of some property, and thus marriage is the means of raising her status. 
The practice has, however, become more or less general to recognize dowry as a 
debt which the husband owes to the wife and which she can claim when she likes. 

a (5-1) By your property is meant the property of the orphans which is under 
your control as guardians. This verse requires guardianship in the case of all who 
are weak of understanding, whether minors or not. While on the one hand the 
Quran lays stress on the transitoriness of this life, on the other it teaches that 
wealth is not a thing to be despised or wasted, because it is the means of support. 

b (5-2) The words "give them a good education" are generally rendered as 
meaning "speak to them good words", but the word qaul (speak) is used to 
express all kinds of deeds. After referring to the maintenance and clothing of the 
orphans in a befitting manner, the Quran now calls attention to another great need 
of theirs which is education. From the first revelation, Islam laid stress on know- 
ledge, read and write (96: 1-5) being its very first message, and the Prophet spoke 
of the acquisition of knowledge as being as great a need of humanity as the acqui- 
sition of wealth. It is the education of orphans that the Quran refers to here, and 
the next verse which enjoins guardians to "test" their wards makes it clear. 

c (6-1) These words show further that the guardian is not only responsible 
for the education of the wards but he is also required to examine them and see 
what progress they have made. According to Abu Hanifah, majority is attained at 
eighteen years, but if maturity of intellect is not attained at eighteen, the limit may 
be extended. These words, moreover, show that marriage should be performed at 
an age after a person has attained majority, not before it, for the age of marriage is 
spoken of as being the age of attaining majority. 

d (6-2) These words allow payment of reasonable wages to the manager of a 
ward's estate out of the ward's property if the manager is not a rich man. 



4:8« LAW OF INHERITANCE 107 

relatives leave, whether it is little or much — an appointed share. " 
8 And when relatives and the orphans and the needy are present at 
the division, give them out of it and speak to them kind words. 
'And let those fear who, if they should leave behind them weakly 
offspring, would fear on their account; so let them observe their 
duty to Allah and let them speak right words. 10 Those who swallow 
the property of the orphans unjustly, they swallow only fire into 
their bellies. And they will burn in blazing fire. 

Section 2: Law of Inheritance 

11 Allah commands you concerning your children: for the male 
is the equal of the portion of two females; but if there are more 
than two females, two-thirds of what the deceased leaves is theirs; 
and if there is one, for her is the half. e And as for his parents, for 
each of them is the sixth of what he leaves, if he has a child; but if 
he has no child and (only) his two parents inherit him, for his 
mother is the third; but if he has brothers, for his mother is the 
sixth, after (payment of) a bequest he may have bequeathed or a 
debt. Your parents and your children, you do not know which of 
them is the nearer to you in benefit. This is an ordinance from 
Allah. Surely Allah is ever Knowing, Wise. 



a (7) Among the Arabs, women and children had no share in inheritance. 
Islam introduced a great reform. The principle laid down here is the basis of the 
Muslim law of inheritance. Children and near relatives, or failing these, distant 
relatives, whether males or females, are the lawful heirs, and the whole of the pro- 
perty does not go to the eldest son. This is in accordance with the broad principles 
of democracy and the brotherhood of man which Islam seeks to establish. 

b (8) That is, distant relatives who for any reason are not entitled to inherit. 

c (11-1) By females are here meant the female children. When daughters are 
the sole heirs they are entitled to a share of two-thirds of the inheritance if there 
are two or more of them (the words "more than two" include the case of two 
daughters). If there is only one daughter she is entitled to a half. 

d (11-2) The parents first take their respective shares, and the residue goes to 
the children, if there are any, failing which, the share of the parents is increased. 
But in case the deceased has brothers, the mother receives the same share as she 
would have received if the deceased had children. In all cases the payment of 
bequests and debts takes precedence of the shares of the heirs. 



108 4. WOMEN «4:12 

12 And yours is half of what your wives leave if they have no 
child; but if they have a child, your share is a fourth of what they 
leave after (payment of) any bequest they may have bequeathed or 
a debt; and theirs is the fourth of what you leave if you have no 
child, but if you have a child, their share is the eighth of what you 
leave after (payment of) a bequest you may have bequeathed or a 
debt." And if a man or a woman, having no children, leaves pro- 
perty to be inherited and he (or she) has a brother or a sister, then 
for each of them is the sixth; but if they are more than that, they 
shall be sharers in the third after (payment of) a bequest that may 
have been bequeathed or a debt not injuring (others). e This is an 
ordinance from Allah, and Allah is Knowing, Forbearing. 

13 These are Allah's limits. And whoever obeys Allah and 
His Messenger, He will admit him to Gardens in which rivers flow, 
to abide in them. And this is the mighty achievement. 14 And 
whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and goes beyond His 
limits, He will make him enter fire to abide in it, and for him is a 
humiliating punishment. 

Section 3: Treatment of Women 

15 And as for those of your women who are guilty of an 
indecency, call to witness against them four (witnesses) from 
among you; so if they bear witness, confine them to the houses 
until death takes them away or Allah opens a way for them.'' 



a (12-1) The husband or the wife (and surviving parents) take their fixed 
shares first, and the residue goes to the children. The two-thirds share for two or 
more daughters can only be given when there are neither parents, nor husband or 
wife; otherwise they take the residue, as in the case of sons or sons and daughters. 

b (12-2) This is the case where the deceased has no children but has parents, 
and therefore the brothers and sisters are not the only heirs and their share is only 
one-sixth. See 4:176 for one who leaves neither children nor parents, and there- 
fore the brothers and the sisters take the whole of the inheritance. 

c (12-3) The words not injuring others mean that debts and bequests shall 
not prejudice the rights of the legal heirs. 

d (15) The word "indecency" here signifies immoral conduct short of illicit 
sexual intercourse, the punishment for which is given in 24:2. Women guilty of 



4 : 16 • TREATMENT OF WOMEN 109 

16 And as for the two of you who are guilty of it, give them both a 
slight punishment; then if they repent and amend, turn aside from 
them. a Surely Allah is ever Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful. 

17 Repentance with Allah is only for those who do evil in 
ignorance, then turn (to Allah) soon, so these it is to whom Allah 
turns (mercifully). And Allah is ever Knowing, Wise. 18 And repent- 
ance is not for those who go on doing evil deeds, until when death 
comes to one of them, he says: Now I repent; nor (for) those who 
die while they are disbelievers. For such We have prepared a pain- 
ful punishment. 

19 O you who believe, it is not lawful for you to take women 
as heritage against (their) will. c Nor should you cause them hard- 
ship by taking part of what you have given them, unless they are 
guilty of manifest indecency. And treat them kindly. Then if you 



immoral conduct are curtailed of their liberty. If they mend their ways, or being 
unmarried they get married, a way is opened for them by Allah, and they regain 
their liberty. 

a (16) The crime spoken of in this verse is the same as that in the previous 
verse. The committers are two, and though the masculine gender is used, it does 
not imply that they are both necessarily males. Slight punishment has been ex- 
plained as meaning reproving with the tongue. 

b (18) Repentance, according to the Quran, implies an actual change in the 
course of one's life, not the mere utterance of words. In fact, the law stated here 
shows how repentance does away with sins. When the very course of a person's 
life is changed in respect of a particular sin, the tendency to that sin is uprooted. 
But those who continue doing evil until death cannot obtain the benefit of repent- 
ance, because there is no time left for them to improve themselves. 

c (19-1) Among the pre-Islamic Arabs, when a man died his elder son or 
other relations had a right to possess his widow or widows, marrying them them- 
selves if they wished, without settling a dowry on them, marrying them to others, 
or prohibiting them from marriage altogether. This is abolished by these words. 

d (19-2) This passage remedies another evil. Some husbands who were dis- 
satisfied with their wives gave them trouble in order to force them to claim a 
divorce and remit the dowry (i.e., the legally-due nuptial gift from the husband to 
the wife). This is disallowed. If the judge finds that the fault lies actually with the 
husband, he will not allow the dowry to be remitted in his favour. It can only be 
taken back if the woman is guilty of immoral conduct. In such cases, when the 
fault is with the woman, she may be required to return it wholly or in part.

placed abundant good in it. 20 And if you wish to have (one) wife 
in the place of another and you have given one of them a heap of 
gold, take nothing from it. Would you take it by slandering (her) 
and (doing her) manifest wrong? a 2 iAnd how can you take it when 
you have been intimate with each other and they have taken from 
you a strong covenant? 

22 And do not marry women whom your fathers married, 
except what has already passed. This surely is indecent and hate- 
ful; and it is an evil way. 

Section 4: What Women may be taken in Marriage 

23 Forbidden to you are your mothers, and your daughters, 
and your sisters, and your paternal aunts, and your maternal aunts, 
and brother's daughters and sister's daughters, and your mothers 
that have suckled you, and your foster-sisters, and mothers of your 
wives, and your stepdaughters who are in your guardianship (born) 
of your wives with whom you have had sexual relations — but if 
you have not had sexual relations with them, there is no blame on 
you — and the wives of your sons who are of your own loins; and 
that you should have two sisters together, except what has already 
passed. Surely Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful, 

24 And all married women except those whom your right 
«■ hands possess (are forbidden); c (this is) Allah's ordinance to you. 

a (20) Another social evil was that a husband, wanting to marry another 
woman instead, would accuse his wife of adultery or other gross immorality, thus 
compelling her to obtain a divorce by paying a large sum of money. 

b (21) Marriage is here called a covenant or agreement between the husband 
and the wife. As there can be no agreement unless both parties give their consent 
to it, marriage in Islam can only be entered into with the free consent of the hus- 
band and wife. 

c (24-1) It is thus forbidden to a man to marry a woman who is already 
married. An exception is made, however, regarding those whom your right hands 
possess. This expression may here mean those whom you have lawfully taken in 
marriage, and the meaning would be that all free women are prohibited to you 
except those whom you have lawfully married. Generally by this expression in the

blame on you about what you mutually agree after what is appoin-

you are (sprung) the one from the other. So marry them with the 
permission of their masters, and give them their dowries justly, 
they being chaste, not fornicating, nor taking lovers in secret; then

shall suffer half the punishment for free married women. This is 
for him among you who fears falling into evil. And that you

Quran are meant those who are taken prisoners in war. It sometimes happened 
that such prisoners became converts to Islam, and therefore they could not be sent 
back. Such women it was lawful to take in marriage, even though they might not 
have been divorced formally by their former husbands. 

a (24-2) The husband and the wife are free to increase or decrease the 
amount of dowry fixed at the time of marriage by agreement among themselves. 

b (25) There is no verse in the Quran or any instance in the Holy Prophet's 
life sanctioning what is called concubinage. Whenever the establishment of con- 
jugal relations with slave-girls or women prisoners of war is mentioned, their 
taking in marriage is clearly laid down as a condition as in v. 3, v. 24, and this 
verse. Here marriage with such women is allowed under the following conditions: 
(1) they should be Muslims; (2) a man has not the means to marry a free woman, 
and (3) he fears to fall into evil.

yourselves by false means except that it be trading by your mutual 
consent. And do not kill your peopled Surely Allah is ever Merci- 
ful to you. 30 And whoever does this aggressively and unjustly, We

have appointed heirs of whatever parents and near relatives leave. 
And as to those with whom your right hands have ratified agree- 
ments, give them their due. Surely Allah is ever Witness over all 
things. e 



a (28) In Islam all principles of right action are stated with such complete- 
ness, devoid of unnecessary details, that the real burden of man is much lighter 
than in any other religion. It, moreover, points out the right way for man's free- 
dom from the bondage of sin, and thus reduces his burden by saving him from 
falling into evil ways. Man being "created weak" refers to Allah's great mercy in 
having shown him the truth and guidance, because he could not chalk out a way 
for himself which was free from error. 

b (29-1) All illegal methods of acquiring property are forbidden. Only the 
seeking of gain from one another by trading by mutual consent is allowed. The 
passage is particularly directed to guard women's right to property, because it was 
women's and orphans' property that was generally swallowed up unjustly. 

c (29-2) This forbids the killing of anfusa-kum, which means your people or 
yourselves. In the first case, the significance is that life must also be protected; in 
the second case, it is an injunction against suicide which according to the law of 
Islam is a grave sin. (Editor's Note: This injunction also forbids sending "your 
people" on suicide missions to their certain death.) 

rf(31) If a person avoids committing sins, the evil inclinations within him 
die also. Division of sins into kabira (major) and saghira (minor) is baseless. 

e (33) In pre-Islamic days, people entered into covenants with one another, 
by which they undertook to defend and inherit one another. Such inheritance was 
abolished by this verse, and the words give them their due mean the rendering of 
assistance in general. 



4:34' DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE 1 1 3 



Section 6: Disagreement between Husband and Wife 

34 Men are the maintainers of women, with what Allah has 
given some of them above others and with what they spend out of 
their wealth. So the good women are obedient (to Allah)," guard- 
ing the unseen as Allah has guarded. And (as to) those on whose 
part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in 
the beds e and turn them away (from wrongdoing). So if they obey 



a (34-1) Obedience here signifies obedience to Allah. This significance of 
the word is made clear by a comparison with 33:31, 33:35, and 66:5. 

b (34-2) This refers to their guarding the husband's rights. The two qualifi- 
cations of a good wife as given here are her obedience to God and chastity. 

c (34-3) The word translated here as desertion, when used about a woman in 
connection with her husband, means her rising against her husband. This is ex- 
plained by the commentators in a number of ways; for example, her leaving the 
husband's place and taking up an abode which he does not like or that the wife 
resisted her husband and hated him and deserted him. The remedy for her correc- 
tion is that she is to be admonished, but if she persists in the wrong course, her 
bed is to be separated, i.e. a cessation of sexual relations. 

rf(34-4) Editor's Note: The words translated as "turn them away" use the 
term darb, and have often been translated as "beat them". Maulana Muhammad 
Ali rendered them as "chastise them" and explained that very slight chastisement 
was allowed only in extreme cases, which should not leave an impression, and 
further that this permission is meant only for the crass type of people in society 
among whom such chastisement is acceptable. However, as he pointed out in his 
footnotes on verses 2:60 and 2:73, the verb darb signifies "all kinds of actions 
except a few"; and apart from striking it is used to mean, for example, marching 
on, setting forth a parable, and likening. In these other senses it is commonly used 
in the Quran. It is used in 43:5 as meaning to turn (something) away: "Shall We 
then turn away the Reminder from you...?", which is how Maulana Muhammad 
Ali and many other translators have rendered this verse. This sense seems to be 
applicable here. Thus the meaning here would be that by admonishing and, if 
necessary, breaking off sexual relations, the husband should turn the wife away 
from her wrong course, or it may mean that if these measures fail he should turn 
her away from himself, i.e. divorce her. It may be added that the Quran clearly 
forbids a man from causing injury to his wife. In its rules for divorce, husbands 
are told about their wives: "retain them with kindness or let them go with kind- 
ness and do not retain them for injury" (2:23 1), "retain them with kindness or part 
from them with kindness ... do not injure them in order to impose hardship upon 
them" (65:2, 6). In fact, only a few verses prior to v. 34 above, in v. 19, husbands 
have been instructed as follows about their wives: "Nor should you cause them

you, do not seek a way against them. Surely Allah is ever Exalted, 
Great. 

35 And if you fear a breach between the two, appoint an 
arbiter from his people and an arbiter from her people. If they both 
desire agreement, Allah will effect harmony between them. Surely 
Allah is ever Knowing, Aware." 

36 And serve Allah, and do not set up any partner with Him, 
and be good to the parents and to the near of kin and the orphans 
and the needy and the neighbour of (your) kin and the alien neigh- 
bour, and the companion in a journey and the traveller and those 
whom your right hands possess. e Surely Allah does not love such 
as are proud, boastful, 3 7who are miserly and tell people to be 
miserly and hide what Allah has given them out of His grace. And 
We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment 



hardship . . . And treat them kindly. Then if you hate them, it may be that you 
dislike a thing while Allah has placed abundant good in it". 

a (35) This verse lays down the procedure for divorce. It is not for the 
husband to put away his wife; it is the business of the judge to decide the case. He 
is required to appoint two arbiters, one belonging to the wife's family and the 
other to the husband's. These two arbiters will find out the facts, but their objec- 
tive must be to effect a reconciliation between the parties. If all hopes of recon- 
ciliation fail, a divorce is allowed, but the final decision for divorce rests with the 
judge who is legally entitled to pronounce a divorce. Cases were decided in accor- 
dance with these directions in the early days of Islam. 

b (36-1) The neighbour of kin may mean a neighbour who is a relative or a 
Muslim neighbour, and the alien neighbour is either a neighbour not related or a 
neighbour of an alien religion. Thus the charity of Islam is not limited to one's 
own people or one's own co-religionists, but is extended to others also. {Editor's 
Note: The companion in a journey or the traveller, mentioned after neighbours, 
could belong to any people or any religion. Indeed, the parents, near of kin, orphans 
and needy mentioned at the beginning could also be non-Muslims and it would be 
a Muslim's duty to do good to them regardless of their religion.) 

c (36-2) By those whom your right hands possess are meant all those with 
whose care you are entrusted, so that it includes even animals over which one has 
control. While dealing with the rights of women, the Quran generalizes the law of 
doing good to others, so much so that it requires goodness to be extended even to 
a fellow-traveller. If even companions whose company is so short-lived are to be 
treated generously, how generous must a man be to her who is the companion of 
his whole life! 



4:38* PURIFICATION OF THE SOUL 1 1 5 

— 3S and those who spend their wealth to be seen by people and do 
not believe in Allah nor in the Last Day. And as for him whose 
companion is the devil, an evil companion is he! 

39 And what (harm) would it do them if they believe in Allah 
and the Last Day and spend (on good works) out of what Allah 
has given them? And Allah is ever Knower of them. 40 Surely 
Allah does not wrong (anyone even by) the weight of an atom; 
and if it is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a 
great reward. a 

41 But how will it be when We bring from every people a 
witness and bring you as a witness against these? 42 0n that day 
will those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger desire 
that the earth were levelled with them. And they can hide no fact 
from Allah. 

Section 7: Purification of the Soul 

43 O you who believe, do not go near prayer when you are 
intoxicated till you know what you say, c nor after sexual inter- 
course — except you are merely passing by — until you have 
bathed. And if you are sick, or on a journey, or one of you has 



a (40) Such is the ever-recurring description of the preponderance of mercy 
in Divine nature: good done is always multiplied and evil nullified by God. 

b (41) The prophet sent to a people is frequently spoken of as being a wit- 
ness in respect of them, and by these are here meant the followers of the Holy 
Prophet Muhammad. It appears that the people spoken of here are Muslims who 
disobey the Prophet, and hence the Prophet's anxiety for the later generations of 
his followers. This is made clear in the verse that follows in the words those who 
disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger. Disobedience amounts to disbelief in 
practice. 

c (43-1) The prohibition against praying when intoxicated was a step towards 
the total prohibition of drink, for the necessity of going to prayer five times a day 
would leave little opportunity for indulgence in drink. The verse also makes it 
clear that one must know the meaning of what one says when praying to God. 

d (43-2) Going near prayer may signify going into mosques, and the 
meaning in that case would be unless you pass (through the mosques) as by a 
way.

women," and you cannot find water, then resort to pure earth and 
wipe your faces and your hands (with it). Surely Allah is ever 
Pardoning, Forgiving. 

44 Do you not see those to whom a portion of the Book was 
given? They buy error and desire to make you go astray from the 
(right) way. 45 And Allah best knows your enemies. And Allah is 
sufficient as a Friend and Allah is sufficient as a Helper. 

46 Some of those who are Jews alter words from their places e 
and say, We have heard and we disobey; and (say), Hear without 
being made to hear, and (say), Ra 'i-nd, distorting with their tongues 
and slandering religion. And if they had said, We hear and we 
obey, and listen, and unzur-na, it would have been better for them 
and more upright; but Allah has cursed them on account of their 
disbelief, so they do not believe except a little. 47 you who have 
been given the Book, believe in what We have revealed, verifying 
what you (already) have, 6 before We destroy the leaders and turn 
them on their backs, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath- 
breakers. And the command of Allah is ever executed. 

48 Surely Allah does not forgive that a partner should be set 
up with Him, and forgives all besides that to whom He pleases. 
And whoever sets up a partner with Allah, he devises indeed a 



a (43-3) Literally, "you have touched women", which is a euphemism for 
sexual intercourse. Many of the fine phrases used in the Quran to express this 
delicate relation were unknown to the Arabs. 

b (43-4) Tayammum means striking both hands on pure earth, or anything 
containing pure dust, and then passing the hands over the face and the backs of 
the hands. When water is not found, or is likely to do harm, tayammum suffices 
instead of ablution before prayer. 

c (46-1) The corruption of the previous books is constantly referred to in the 
Quran, and, as the words clearly show, it implies a corruption of the text as well 
as a false rendering of it. 

d (46-2) See 2: 104 and footnote. 

e (47) The verification referred to here and elsewhere implies only a verifi- 
cation of the general principles and the prophecies contained in the earlier books.

great sin. a 49 Have you not seen those who attribute purity to them- 
selves? ' Rather, Allah purifies whom He pleases, and they will 
not be dealt with unjustly in the least. 50 See how they forge lies 
against Allah! And sufficient is this as a manifest sin. 

Section 8: Kingdom granted to Abraham's Descendants 

51 Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book 
was given? They believe in sorcery and diviners c and say of those 
who disbelieve: These are better guided in the path than those who 
believe. 52 Those are they whom Allah has cursed. And whomever 
Allah curses, you will not find a helper for him. 53 0r have they a 
share in the kingdom? But then they would not give to people 
even the speck on a date-stone. 54 0r do they envy the people for 
what Allah has given them of His grace? But indeed We have 
given to Abraham's children the Book and the Wisdom, and We 
have given them a grand kingdom. e 55 So some of them believe in 



a (48) Shirk or setting up partners with Allah is spoken of as the gravest sin. 
Wrong belief in false deities lowers the dignity of man. Man is made to rule 
nature itself and all creatures, but when he lowers himself before creatures lower 
than himself, he sets at naught the very purpose of his creation. It should be noted 
that shirk or setting up gods with God also includes blind obedience rendered to 
leaders; see 9:31 and also the next footnote. It should also be noted that if a 
person guilty of shirk repents of it before his death then all his sins including shirk 
are forgiven because he gives a new turn to his life. Even those who die while 
guilty of shirk will, after suffering the consequences of their deeds in the after life, 
be received into the mercy of God. 

b (49) These are the priests, doctors of law and monks who demanded blind 
obedience from their followers, and include such ulama, shaikhs and pirs among 
the Muslims as well. 

c (51) These words seem to refer to the general debasement of the Jews, who 
believed in all kinds of enchantment, divination, and sorcery, and had long bidden 
farewell in practice to the pure monotheism of Moses. 

d (53) This shows that a temporal or worldly kingdom cannot be granted to a 
nation which would not deal liberally with others. 

e (54) By the people are meant the Arabs. The promised kingdom was still in 
Abraham's seed, but was now transferred from the descendants of Israel to those 
of Ishmael, in accordance with the covenant made with Abraham.

cient to burn. 

56 Those who disbelieve in Our Messages, We shall make 
them enter Fire. As often as their skins are burned, We shall change 
them for other skins, that they may taste the punishment. Surely 
Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. 57 And those who believe and do good 
deeds, We shall make them enter Gardens in which rivers flow, to 
abide in them forever. They will have therein pure companions 
and We shall make them enter a pleasant shade. 

58 Surely Allah commands you to make over trusts to those 
worthy of them, and that when you judge between people, you 
judge with justice. 6 Surely Allah instructs you with what is 
excellent. Surely Allah is ever Hearing, Seeing. 59 you who 
believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority 
from among you; then if you quarrel about anything, refer it to 
Allah and the Messenger, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. e 
This is best and more suitable to (achieve) the end. 

Section 9: The Prophet must be obeyed 

60 Have you not seen those who assert that they believe in 
what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you? 
They desire to seek the judgment of the devil, though they have 



a (55) By "him" is meant the Holy Prophet Muhammad, who was now the 
true exponent of Abraham's religion. 

b (58) Muslims, having been granted worldly rule, are here told to entrust 
the affairs of State to people who are worthy of this responsibility, while the autho- 
rities and judges so entrusted are required to judge with justice. 

c (59) This verse lays down three important rules in matters relating to the 
welfare of the Muslim community and to affairs of State. These are obedience to 
God and His Messenger in the first place; secondly, obedience to those in autho- 
rity from among the Muslims; and thirdly, referring matters to God and His 
Messenger in cases of dispute with those in authority. God and His Messenger are 
thus the final authority. It is especially in matters religious that differences would 
arise, in which case it would be necessary to refer the matter to God and His 
Messenger; in other words to the Quran and Hadith. In case of Muslims living 
under non-Muslim authority, Islam requires them to abide by the laws of the land. 



4:61' THE PROPHET MUST BE OBEYED 1 1 9 

been commanded to deny him. And the devil desires to lead them 
far astray. 61 And when it is said to them, Come to what Allah has 
revealed and to the Messenger, you see the hypocrites turning away 
from you with aversion. 62 But how is it that when a misfortune 
befalls them on account of what their hands have already done, 
they come to you swearing by Allah: We desired nothing but good 
and concord? 63 These are they, the secrets of whose hearts Allah 
knows; so turn aside from them and admonish them and speak to 
them effective words concerning themselves. 

64 And We sent no messenger but that he should be obeyed 
by Allah's command. And if they had, when they wronged them- 
selves, come to you and asked forgiveness of Allah, and the 
Messenger had (also) asked forgiveness for them, they would have 
found Allah Oft-returning (to mercy), merciful. 65 But no, by your 
Lord! they do not believe until they make you a judge of what is in 
dispute between them, then find no reluctance in their hearts as to 
what you decide and submit with full submission. 66 And if We had 
ordained for them: Lay down your lives or go forth from your 
homes, they would not have done it except a few of them." And if 
they had done what they are exhorted to do, it would certainly 
have been better for them and more strengthening, 67 and then We 
would certainly have given them from Ourselves a great reward, 
68 and We would certainly have guided them in the right path. 

69 And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, they are with 
those upon whom Allah has bestowed favours from among the 
prophets and the truthful and the faithful and the righteous, and a 
goodly company are they! 



a (66) The Companions of the Holy Prophet had to lay down their lives in 
defence of their faith, and had to leave their homes for the sake of their religion. 
But the hypocrites at Madinah were too weak of heart to undergo such hardships. 
They were only required to contribute to the struggle which was being carried on 
for national defence and to obey the Prophet' s orders which was a far easier task, 
but they did not do even this. 

b (69) Those upon whom Allah has bestowed favours are spoken of as 
belonging to four classes: (1) the prophets; (2) the truthful — those who are true 
in their sayings and their belief, and confirm their truth by their deeds or acting; 
(3) the faithful — those who bear witness to the truth both by words and deeds, 



120 4. WOMEN • 4 : 70 

70 Such is the grace from Allah, and Allah is sufficient as 
Knower. 

Section 10: Believers must defend Themselves 

71 O you who believe, take your precautions, then go forth in 
detachments or go forth in a body. 72 And among you is he who 
would hang back. Then if a misfortune befalls you, he says: Allah 
indeed bestowed a favour on me as I was not present with them. 
73 And if bounty from Allah comes to you, he would cry, as if there 
were no friendship between you and him: If only I had been with 
them, then I should have achieved a mighty success! 74 So let those 
fight in the way of Allah who sell this world's life for the Here- 
after. And whoever fights in the way of Allah, whether he is killed 
or is victorious, We shall grant him a mighty reward. 

75 And what reason have you not to fight in the way of Allah, 
and of the weak among the men and the women and the children, 
who say: Our Lord, take us out of this town, whose people are 
oppressors, and grant us from Yourself a friend, and grant us from 
Yourself a helper!" 76 Those who believe fight in the way of Allah, 
and those who disbelieve fight in the way of the devil. So fight 
against the friends of the devil; surely the struggle of the devil is 
ever weak. 



and one slain in defence of his religion is included because he too gives evidence 
of the truth of religion by laying down his life; (4) the righteous or those who 
stick to the right course in all their deeds, come what may. Those who obey Allah 
and the Messenger are here told that they are with the perfect ones who belong to 
these four classes. Thus this verse promises to those who have not attained to per- 
fection the company, in the life to come, of those who have attained to perfection 
when the former have done their best to obey God and His Messenger. It may be 
added that no one can become a prophet by obeying the Holy Prophet. If this were 
true, not only would all the truthful and the faithful and the righteous be prophets, 
because they perfectly obeyed Allah and His Messenger, but even all those who 
tried to follow them would also be prophets which is absurd. 

a (75) This explains what is meant by fighting in the way of Allah. While 
most of the believers who had the means had escaped from Makkah, there 
remained those who were weak and unable to undertake a journey. These were 
still persecuted and oppressed at Makkah. Fighting to deliver them from the per- 
secution of their oppressors was really fighting in the way of Allah. 



4 : 77 • ATTITUDE OF THE HYPOCRITES 121 

Section 1 1 : Attitude of the Hypocrites 

77 Have you not seen those to whom it was said: Withhold 
your hands, and keep up prayer and give the due charity. But when 
fighting is prescribed for them, then some of them fear men as 
they ought to fear Allah, or with a greater fear, and say: Our Lord, 
why have You ordained fighting for us? Would You not grant us 
respite for a little while?" Say: The enjoyment of this world is 
short, and the Hereafter is better for him who keeps his duty. And 
you will not be dealt with unjustly in the least. 78 Wherever you are, 
death will overtake you, though you are in towers, raised high. 
And if good befalls them, they say: This is from Allah; and if a 
misfortune befalls them, they say: This is from you. Say: All is 
from Allah. But what is the matter with these people that they 
make no effort to understand anything? 79 Whatever good befalls 
you (O man), it is from Allah, and whatever misfortune befalls you, 
it is from yourself. And We have sent you (O Prophet) to man- 
kind as a Messenger. And Allah is sufficient as a witness. 

80 Whoever obeys the Messenger, he indeed obeys Allah. 
And whoever turns away, We have not sent you as a keeper over 
them. 81 And they say: Obedience. But when they go out from your 
presence, a group of them plan by night doing otherwise than what 
you say. And Allah writes down what they plan by night, so turn 
aside from them and trust in Allah. And Allah is sufficient as hav- 
ing charge of affairs. 82 Will they not then meditate on the Quran? 



a (77) Had there been any hope of plunder to animate the ranks of Muslims, 
those who loved this world most, who are here called the hypocrites, would have 
been foremost in fighting; but as they knew that they were fighting against odds, 
they considered acting on this order as equivalent to courting death, and requested 
to be granted a respite until they died a natural death. 

b (79) Good and evil, or benefits and misfortunes, proceed from Allah; but 
while He sends benefits from Himself, i.e. out of His beneficence, no evil or mis- 
fortune afflicts a man unless his own hands have called for it. The previous verse 
states that the hypocrites attributed their misfortunes to the Prophet; they are told, 
in the words "All is from Allah", that misfortunes were sent by Allah. This verse 
tells them that, though sent by Allah, the immediate cause of these misfortunes 
was to be found in their own doings. 



122 4. WOMEN • 4 : 83 

And if it were from any other than Allah, they would have found 
in it many a discrepancy. a 83 But if any news of security or fear 
comes to them, they spread it about. And if they had referred it to 
the Messenger and to those in authority among them, those of 
them who can search out knowledge of it would have known it. 
And if it were not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, 
you would certainly have followed the devil except a few. 84 Fight 
then in Allah's way — you are not responsible except for yourself; 
and urge on the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the 
fighting of those who disbelieve. And Allah is stronger in prowess 
and stronger to give exemplary punishment. 

85 Whoever intercedes in a good cause has a share of it, and 
whoever intercedes in an evil cause has a portion of it. And Allah 
is ever Keeper over all things. c 86 And when you are greeted with 
a greeting, greet with one better than it, or return it. Surely Allah 



a (82) The Quran was not written out and given on one occasion, but it con- 
tinued to be delivered in small portions during twenty-three years under the most 
varying circumstances. But what is striking throughout the entire revelation is that 
it keeps up one and the same strain — absolute submission to Allah, entire trust in 
Him, perfect confidence of future success, a liberal view of humanity, an attitude 
of charity towards all nations and religions, and goodness to all alike. The spirit of 
the revelations to the solitary, persecuted, and rejected preacher of Makkah does 
not differ in these and a hundred other particulars from the spirit of the revelations 
to the sole temporal and spiritual monarch of Arabia. 

b (84) The primary duty to defend Islam lay on the Holy Prophet alone, as 
against all the forces of Arabia. This shows that he never put any trust in the 
prowess of his followers, and his confidence was based solely on Divine help. 

c (85) The meaning is that he who joins himself to another and assists him, 
and becomes to him as one of a pair or an intercessor in doing good or evil, and 
thus aids him and strengthens him, partakes with him the benefit or the harm of it. 
Interceding here also implies that one institutes for another a way of good or a 
way of evil which the other imitates, and thus becomes to him as one of a pair. 
The connection is clear; the Prophet made himself an example of good for others 
to imitate or to aid him. For the meaning of intercession see 2:255 footnote 1. 

d (86) A greeting is a prayer for the good of another; tahiyyah, the word used 
for it here, meaning originally a prayer for one 's long life. The minimum require- 
ment is that a greeting must be returned in the same words. What is really aimed 
at is that a Muslim should always wish good for, or do good to, his brother, and 
the other is required to do greater good in return. 



4 : 87 • HOW TO DEAL WITH THE HYPOCRITES 123 

ever takes account of all things. 87 Allah, there is no god but He — 
He will certainly gather you together on the day of Resurrection, 
there is no doubt in it. And who is more true in word than Allah? 

Section 12: How to deal with the Hypocrites 

88 Why should you, then, be two parties in relation to the 
hypocrites while Allah has made them return (to disbelief) for 
what they have earned? Do you desire to guide him whom Allah 
leaves in error? And whomsoever Allah leaves in error you cannot 
find a way for him. 89 They long that you should disbelieve as they 
have disbelieved so that you might be on the same level; so do not 
take from among them friends until they flee (their homes) in 
Allah's way. Then if they turn back (to hostility), seize them and 
kill them wherever you find them, and take no friend nor helper 
from among them, 90 except those who join a people between whom 
and you there is an alliance, or who come to you, their hearts 
shrinking from fighting you or fighting their own people. And if 
Allah had pleased, He would have given them power over you, so 
that they would have fought you. So if they withdraw from you 
and do not fight you and offer you peace, then Allah allows you no 
way against them." 91 You will find others who desire to be secure 
from you and secure from their own people. Whenever they are 
made to return to hostility, they are plunged into it. So if they do 
not withdraw from you, nor offer you peace and restrain their 
hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. 
And against these We have given you a clear authority. 



a (90) This shows clearly that even waverers were not to be killed or fought 
against if they refrained from fighting, though they may have gone over to 
disbelief after accepting Islam. The persons referred to in this verse were disbelie- 
vers and not Muslims. Note also that we have here the clear injunction that if any 
people offered peace, they were not to be fought against. 

b (91) Editor's Note: The meaning of the words "then seize them and kill 
them wherever you find them" is clearly shown by the preceding text: "So if they 
do not withdraw from you, nor offer you peace and restrain their hands". Those 
enemies are meant who themselves attacked the Muslims first. The words "kill 
them wherever you find them" also occur in 2:190-191, preceded by: "And fight 
in the way of Allah against those who fight against you but do not be aggressive".

Section 13: Murderer of a Muslim 

92 And a believer would not kill a believer except by mistake." 
And he who kills a believer by mistake should free a believing 
slave, and blood-money should be paid to his people unless they 
forgo it as charity. But if he is from a tribe hostile to you and he is 
a believer, the freeing of a believing slave (is sufficient). And if he 
is from a tribe between whom and you there is a covenant, the 
blood-money should be paid to his people along with the freeing 
of a believing slave; but he who has not the means should fast for 
two months successively: a penance from Allah. And Allah is ever 
Knowing, Wise. 93 And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his 
punishment is hell, abiding in it; and Allah is furious with him and 
He has cursed him and prepared for him a grievous punishment. 

94 O you who believe, when you go forth (to fight) in Allah's 
way, make investigation, and do not say to anyone who offers you 
salutation, Fou are not a believer, seeking the good of this world's 
life. e But with Allah there are abundant gains. You too were such 
before, then Allah conferred a benefit on you; so make investiga- 
tion. Surely Allah is ever Aware of what you do. 95 Those who 
hold back from among the believers, not disabled by injury, and 
those who strive hard in Allah's way with their property and their 



a (92) The man who killed a believer intentionally could not be a believer. 
Disbelievers often made use of ruses, professing belief in Islam and thus tempting 
Muslims to go over to them as religious teachers, and afterwards murdering them. 

b (93) The commentators are agreed that this verse speaks of a disbeliever 
who murders a believer. In fact, the word intentionally stands here for murdering 
a man because he is a believer, as this was what the disbelievers often did. 

c (94) The original word for salutation is salam (meaning peace). The first 
word of the Muslim salutation stands therefore for the Muslim salutation. The 
Muslims were surrounded by enemies on all sides, yet they were told not to pre- 
sume that every Arab tribe belonged to the enemy camp but were to make an 
investigation first. Even when a man belonging to an enemy tribe offered the 
Muslim salutation, to show that he was a Muslim, he was to be taken as a brother 
Muslim and could not be dealt with as an enemy. Incidentally, it lays down the 
principle that no Muslim can be called a kafir, not even the man whose claim to 
Islam is borne out only by offering the Muslim salutation.

persons, are not equal. Allah has made those who strive with their 
property and their persons to excel those who hold back by a (high) 
degree. And to each Allah has promised good. And Allah has 
granted to those who strive above those who hold back a mighty 
reward — "(high) degrees from Him and protection and mercy. 
And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 

Section 14: Muslims who remained with the Enemy 

97 (As for) those whom the angels cause to die while they are 
unjust to themselves, (the angels) will say: What were you doing? 
They will say: We were weak in the earth. (The angels) will say: 
Was not Allah's earth spacious, so that you could have migrated 
in it? So these it is whose refuge is hell — and it is an evil 
destination." 98 Except the weak from among the men and the 
women and the children who do not have the means, nor can they 
find a way (to escape); "so these, it may be that Allah will pardon 
them. And Allah is ever Pardoning, Forgiving. 100 And whoever 
flees in Allah's way, he will find in the earth many a place of 
escape and abundant resources. And whoever goes forth from his 
home fleeing to Allah and His Messenger, then death overtakes 
him, his reward is indeed with Allah. And Allah is ever Forgiving, 
Merciful. 

Section 15: Prayer when Fighting 

101 And when you journey in the earth, there is no blame on 
you if you shorten the prayer, if you fear that those who disbelieve 
will give you trouble.* Surely the disbelievers are an open enemy 
to you. 102 And when you are among them and lead the prayer for

convinced of the truth of Islam, but chose to remain among the disbelievers, who 
did not allow them to give expression to their beliefs, despite having the means to 
join the Muslims and avow Islam openly. 

b (101) The prayer service on a journey is shorter than the ordinary prayer 
service in the zuhr (midday), 'asr (afternoon) and 'isha' (night) prayers but the 
shortening of prayer as mentioned in this verse is quite different from the ordinary 
shorter service of the journey, and its details are given in the next verse.

them, let a group of them stand up with you, and let them take 
their arms. Then when they have performed their prostration, let 
them go to your rear, and let another group who have not prayed 
come forward and pray with you, and let them take their pre- 
cautions and their arms. Those who disbelieve long that you may 
neglect your arms and your baggage, that they may attack you 
with a sudden united attack. And there is no blame on you, if you 
are inconvenienced on account of rain or if you are sick, to put 
away your arms; and take your precautions. Surely Allah has pre- 
pared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers." 103 So when 
you have finished the prayer, remember Allah standing and sitting 
and reclining. But when you are secure (from danger) keep up 
(regular) prayer. Prayer indeed has been enjoined on the believers 
at fixed times. 4 104 And do not be weak-hearted in pursuit of the 
enemy. If you suffer they (too) suffer as you suffer, and you hope 
from Allah what they do not hope. And Allah is ever Knowing, 
Wise. 

Section 16: Hypocrites are Dishonest 

105 Surely We have revealed the Book to you with truth that 
you may judge between people by means of what Allah has taught 
you. And do not be one pleading the cause of the dishonest/ 



a (102) This verse and the previous one show the importance of prayer and 
of offering prayer in congregation in Islam, which could not be neglected even on 
the field of battle. 

b (103) The hours of prayer were fixed by the Prophet under Divine guid- 
ance, and the observance of the hours of prayer is an essential part of the due 
observance of prayer. It is this feature of the Islamic prayer which makes it a 
unique force in the unification of the human race. 

c (105) The occasion of the revelation of these verses was a dispute between 
a Muslim and a Jew, in which judgment was given by the Prophet against the 
Muslim. It was a time when every Muslim hand was sorely needed for the 
defence of Islam, and a verdict against a man supported by his whole tribe meant 
the loss of that tribe. But such considerations did not carry any weight with the 
Prophet. Thus these verses lay down the broad principle that dishonesty must be 
punished, and the balance of justice must be held equal between Muslims and 
non-Muslims and between friends and foes.

106 and ask the forgiveness of Allah." Surely Allah is ever For- 
giving, Merciful. 107 And do not contend on behalf of those who 
act unfaithfully to their souls. Surely Allah does not love him who 
is treacherous, sinful: 108 They seek to hide from people and they 
cannot hide from Allah, and He is with them when they counsel 
by night matters which do not please Him. And Allah ever encom- 
passes what they do. 109 Look! You are they who may contend on 
their behalf in this world's life, but who will contend with Allah 
on their behalf on the day of Resurrection, or who will have charge 
of their affairs? 

110 And whoever does evil or wrongs his soul, then asks 
forgiveness of Allah, will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful. ni And 
whoever commits a sin, commits it only against himself. And Allah 
is ever Knowing, Wise. 112 And whoever commits a fault or a sin, 
then accuses of it one innocent, he indeed takes upon himself the 
burden of a slander and a manifest sin. 

Section 17: Secret Counsels of the Hypocrites 

113 And if it were not for Allah's grace upon you and His 
mercy, a group of them had certainly aimed to ruin you. And they 
ruin only themselves, and they cannot harm you in any way. And 
Allah has revealed to you the Book and the Wisdom, and taught 
you what you did not know, and Allah's grace on you is very 
great. 114 There is no good in most of their secret counsels except 
(in) him who enjoins charity or goodness or reconciliation 
between people. And whoever does this, seeking Allah's pleasure, 
We shall give him a mighty reward. 115 And whoever acts hostilely 
to the Messenger after guidance has become manifest to him and 
follows other than the way of the believers, We turn him to that to 



a (106) The injunction in this as well as the previous verse is meant for 
every Muslim who is called upon to act as a judge. He must be strictly just as 
between his own people and aliens, and must further ask the protection of Allah 
from being guilty of an act of injustice, even unknowingly. 

b (108) Those who supported the guilty man are condemned here as hypo- 
crites. The same subject is continued in the verses that follow.

which he (himself) turns and make him enter hell; and it is an evil 
destination." 

Section 18: Idolatry condemned 

116 Surely Allah does not forgive setting up partners with 
Him, and He forgives all besides this to whom He pleases. And 
whoever sets up a partner with Allah, he indeed goes far astray. 
117 Besides Him they call on nothing but female divinities and they 
call on nothing but a rebellious devil, 118 whom Allah has cursed. 
And he said: Certainly I will take of Your servants an appointed 
portion; 119 and certainly I will lead them astray and excite in them 
vain desires and bid them so that they will slit the ears of the 
cattle^ and bid them so that they will alter Allah's creation. And 
whoever takes the devil for a friend, forsaking Allah, he indeed 
suffers a manifest loss. 120 He promises them and excites vain 
desires in them. And the devil promises them only to deceive. 
121 These — their refuge is hell, and they will find no way of 
escape from it. 

122 And those who believe and do good, We shall make them 
enter Gardens in which rivers flow, to abide in them forever. It is 



a (115) This verse clearly speaks of the hypocrites, who followed a way 
other than the way of the believers. Only a distortion of the words could make 
them signify that it was a sin to differ with the majority of the Muslims on any 
question of religion. 

b (117) The word translated here as "female divinities" can signify inanimate 
things, such as trees and stones and wood, which they worshipped, as well as 
idols because they named the idols as females. 

c (119-1) The practice of slitting or cutting off the ear of certain animals was 
a prevalent form of polytheism in Arabia, for such an animal was looked upon as 
devoted to certain idols. 

d (119-2) A comparison with 30:30 will show clearly that by Allah's crea- 
tion is here meant the religion of Allah, the natural religion of man. By the devil's 
changing the creation of Allah is therefore meant the changing of the natural reli- 
gion of man which requires obedience to Allah and His laws. Some commentators 
understand by changing the creation of Allah the using of His created things for 
an object other than that for which they were created, and worshipping objects 
such as the sun, etc., which were really created to be subservient to man. 



4:123' EQUITABLE DEALINGS 129 

Allah's promise, in truth. And who is more truthful in word than 
Allah? 123 It will not be in accordance with your vain desires nor 
the vain desires of the People of the Book. Whoever does evil, 
will be recompensed for it and will not find for himself besides 
Allah a friend or a helper." 124 And whoever does good deeds, 
whether male or female, and is a believer — these will enter the 
Garden, and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least. 
125 And who is better in religion than he who submits himself entirely 
to Allah while doing good (to others) and follows the faith of 
Abraham, the upright one? And Allah took Abraham for a friend. 
126 And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever 
is in the earth. And Allah ever encompasses all things. 

Section 19: Equitable Dealings with Orphans and Widows 

127 And they ask you a decision about women. Say: Allah 
makes known to you His decision concerning them; and what is 
recited to you in the Book is concerning widowed women, whom 
you do not give what is appointed for them, while you are not 
inclined to marry them, nor to the weak among children, and that 
you should deal justly with orphans. And whatever good you do, 
Allah is surely ever Knower of it. 128 And if a woman fears 



a (123) Editor's Note: Divine reward is not bestowed upon anyone in accor- 
dance with their vain desires, whether they are Muslims or Jews or Christians. 
People are judged by their deeds, and rewarded or punished accordingly. 

b (127) It is stated here that a decision regarding the doing of good to 
women, to weak children and to orphans has already been given (see 4: 1-10). The 
words "and what is recited to you in the Book is concerning widowed women, 
whom you do not give what is appointed for them while you are not inclined to 
marry them" refer to 4:3. The meaning is that the order given in 4:3 in the words 
"if you fear that you cannot do justice to orphans marry such women as seem 
good to you" relates to orphans of the women (or to widows) whom their share in 
inheritance was denied, both their share and the share of their orphan children, nor 
were people inclined to marry them owing to the burden which they brought with 
them in the shape of their children. So the permission was given that they may 
marry such women, even up to four. Widows and their orphaned children used to 
receive no share of inheritance. The Quran brought about a great change: it re- 
quired the giving of inheritance both to women and their orphaned children, and it 
also recommended that such women should be taken in marriage.

ill-usage from her husband or desertion, there is no blame on the 
two of them if they effect a reconciliation between them. And 
reconciliation is better. And greed is met with in (people's) minds. 
And if you do good (to others) and keep your duty, surely Allah is 
ever Aware of what you do. 129 And you cannot do justice between 
wives, even though you wish (it), but do not be disinclined (from 
one) with total disinclination, so that you leave her in suspense. 
And if you are reconciled and keep your duty, surely Allah is ever 
Forgiving, Merciful. 130 And if they separate, Allah will render 
them both free from want out of His ampleness. And Allah is ever 
Ample-giving, Wise. 

131 And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and 
whatever is in the earth. And certainly We charged those who were 
given the Book before you, and (We also charge) you, to keep 
your duty to Allah. And if you disbelieve, surely to Allah belongs 
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And Allah 
is ever Self-sufficient, Praiseworthy. 132 And to Allah belongs what- 
ever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And Allah is 
sufficient as having charge of affairs. 133 If He please, He will take 
you away, O people, and bring others. And Allah is ever Powerful 
to do that. i 34 Whoever desires the reward of this world — then 
with Allah is the reward of this world and the Hereafter. And 
Allah is ever Hearing, Seeing. 

Section 20: Hypocrisy condemned 

135 O you who believe, be maintainers of justice, bearers of 
witness for Allah, even if it is against your own selves or (your) 
parents or near relatives — whether he is rich or poor, Allah has a 
better right over them both." So do not follow (your) low desires, 
that you deviate. And if you distort (the truth) or turn away (from 
it), surely Allah is ever Aware of what you do. 



a (135) "Allah has a better right over them" means that they should be dealt 
with justly. Thus, neither ties of kinship and love nor considerations of fear, 
favour, or compassion should make one swerve a hair's breadth from the truth. 



4:136' END OF THE HYPOCRITES 1 3 1 

136 O you who believe, believe in Allah and His Messenger 
and the Book which He has revealed to His Messenger and the 
Book which He revealed before. And whoever disbelieves in Allah 
and His angels and His Books and His messengers and the Last 
Day, he indeed strays far away. 137 Those who believe then 
disbelieve, again believe and again disbelieve, then increase in 
disbelief, Allah will never forgive them nor guide them in the 
(right) way. a 138 Give news to the hypocrites that for them is a 
painful punishment — 139 those who take disbelievers for friends 
rather than believers. Do they seek for might from them? Might 
surely belongs wholly to Allah. 

140 And indeed He has revealed to you in the Book that when 
you hear Allah's messages disbelieved in and mocked at, do not 
sit with them until they enter into some other discourse, for then 
indeed you would be like them. Surely Allah will gather together 
the hypocrites and the disbelievers all in hell — 141 those who wait 
(for misfortunes) for you. Then if you have a victory from Allah 
they say: Were we not with you? And if there is a chance for the 
disbelievers, they say: Did we not prevail over you and defend you 
from the believers? So Allah will judge between you on the day of 
Resurrection. And Allah will by no means give the disbelievers a 
way against the believers. 

Section 21 : End of the Hypocrites 

142 The hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, and He will pay 
them back their deceit. And when they stand up for prayer, they 
stand up sluggishly — they do it only to be seen by people and 



a (137) Allah's not guiding them is the consequence of their own actions. 
They wavered first but in the end became firm in disbelief. 

b (140) See 6:68 which was revealed at Makkah. Muslims are told to leave 
the assembly where truth is derided. Criticism is quite a different thing and a 
Muslim should always be ready to meet any criticism of his religion. (Editor 's 
Note: Thus the response when faced with mere ridicule of Islam is to withdraw, 
temporarily, from that company of people and rejoin them later when they stop 
their mocking. It is therefore entirely wrong to believe that Muslims are required 
to attack physically, still less kill, those who deride their religion.) 



132 4. WOMEN • 4 : 143 

they remember Allah but little, 143 wavering between that (and this) 
— (belonging) neither to these nor to those." And whomsoever 
Allah leaves in error, you will not find a way for him. 144 you 
who believe, do not take the disbelievers for friends instead of the 
believers. Do you desire to give Allah a manifest proof against 
yourselves? 145 The hypocrites are surely in the lowest depths of 
the Fire, and you will find no helper for them, 146 except those who 
repent and amend and hold fast to Allah and are sincere in their 
obedience to Allah — these are with the believers. And Allah will 
soon grant the believers a mighty reward. 147 Why should Allah 
punish you if you are grateful and believe? And Allah is ever 
Multiplier of rewards, Knowing.

148 Allah does not love the public utterance of hurtful speech, 
«■ except by one who has been wronged. c And Allah is ever Hearing, 
Knowing. 149 If you do good openly or keep it secret or pardon an 
evil, Allah surely is ever Pardoning, Powerful. 

150 Those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers and 
desire to make a distinction between Allah and His messengers 
and say: We believe in some and disbelieve in others; and desire 
to take a course in between — 151 these are truly disbelievers; and 
We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment. 
152 And those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make 
no distinction between any of them, to them He will grant their 
rewards. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 6 



a (143) The reference in "that and this" is to belief and disbelief. 

b (147) The word shakir, usually meaning thankful, when used as an attri- 
bute of the Divine Being signifies One Who multiplies rewards to His servants. 

c (148) The use of defamatory speech of every kind regarding others is stric- 
tly forbidden, but justification for it may exist in case a person has in some way 
been wronged. 

rf(149) If you pardon the evil which anyone has done to you, Allah will 
pardon your evils, and grant you even good reward; He is not only Pardoning, but 
also Powerful to grant good reward. 

e (152) To make distinction between Allah and His messengers means to 
believe in one and not in the other. Islam requires the acceptance of all prophets 
who were raised for the regeneration of mankind, and hence a denial of any one of 



4:153' TRANSGRESSIONS OF THE JEWS 133 

Section 22: Transgressions of the Jews 

153 The People of the Book ask you to bring down to them a 
Book from heaven; indeed they demanded of Moses a greater thing 
than that, for they said: Show us Allah manifestly. So destructive 
punishment overtook them on account of their wrongdoing. Then 
they took the calf (for a god), after clear signs had come to them, 
but We pardoned this. And We gave Moses clear authority. 154 And 
We raised the mountain above them at their covenant. And We 
said to them: Enter the gate submissively. And We said to them: 
Do not violate the Sabbath; and We took from them a firm 
covenant. 

155 Then for their breaking their covenant and their disbelief 
in the messages of Allah and their killing the prophets unjustly 
and their saying, Our hearts are securely covered; no, Allah has 
sealed them on account of their disbelief, so they do not believe 
but a little; " 156 and for their disbelief and for their uttering against 
Mary a grievous slander; 157 and for their saying: We have killed 
the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah, and they 
did not kill him, nor did they cause his death on the cross, c but he 

the prophets named in the Quran takes a person out of the category of believers 
and places him among the disbelievers. 

a (155) The incidents referred to in verses 153-155 have been mentioned in 
detail in 2:51-71; see the footnotes there. 

b (156) The slander referred to was that Mary was guilty of fornication. 

c (157-1) The words used here do not negative that Jesus was nailed to the 
cross; they negative his having expired on the cross as a result of being nailed to 
it. That Jesus died a natural death is plainly stated in 5:117. The Gospels contain 
clear testimony showing that Jesus Christ escaped death on the cross. For example, 
Jesus remained on the cross for a few hours only (Mark 15:25, John 19:14) but 
death by crucifixion was always slow. When the side of Jesus was pierced, blood 
rushed out and this was a certain sign of life (John 19:34). Jesus was not buried 
but was given into the charge of a wealthy disciple of his, who lavished care on 
him and put him in a spacious tomb hewn in the side of a rock (Mark 15:46). 
When the tomb was seen on the third day, the stone was found to have been 
removed from its mouth (Mark 16:4), which would not have been the case if there 
had been a supernatural rising. Jesus Christ prayed the whole night before his 
arrest to be saved from the accursed death on the cross, and he also asked his 
disciples to pray for him. He seems to have even received a promise from God to 



134 4. WOMEN • 4 : 158 

was made to appear to them as such." And certainly those who 
differ concerning it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge 
about it, but only follow a conjecture, and they did not kill him for 
certain; 158 rather, Allah exalted him in His presence. And Allah is 
ever Mighty, Wise. 159 And there is none of the People of the Book 
but will believe in this before his death; and on the day of 
Resurrection he will be a witness against them. c 

160 So for the wrongdoing of the Jews, We forbade them the 
good things which had been made lawful for them, and for their 
hindering many (people) from Allah's way. 161 And for their taking 
usury — though indeed they were forbidden it — and their 
devouring the property of people falsely. And We have prepared 
for the disbelievers from among them a painful punishment. 162 But 
the firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in 

be saved, and it was to this promise that he referred when he cried out on the 
cross: "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?" The statements made in 
the Quran corroborate the testimony found in the Gospels. Jesus did not die on the 
cross, nor was he killed as were the two thieves who were crucified with him, but 
to people he appeared as if he were dead. 

a (157-2) These words may bear two interpretations: he was made to be like 
it to them or the matter was made dubious to them. The story that someone else 
was made to resemble Jesus is not borne out by the words of the Quran, which 
could only mean, if an object were mentioned, that Jesus was made to resemble 
someone, not that someone was made to resemble Jesus. 

b (158) For "exaltation" see 3:55 footnote 2. Being exalted in the Divine 
presence was opposed to being killed on the cross. Deuteronomy 21:23 explains 
this, for there we have, he who is hanged is accursed of God. If Jesus had died on 
the cross he would have been accursed; hence the statement made here — he was 
not killed on the cross and accursed but he was exalted in the Divine presence. 

c (159) Both Jews and Christians necessarily believe in the death of Jesus on 
the cross, while according to the Quran they have really no sure knowledge of it. 
The belief of the Jews is that since Jesus died on the cross he was accursed of 
God, and hence he cannot be a prophet. Following quite a different line of argu- 
ment, Christians believe that Jesus died on the cross and was accursed, but that 
unless Jesus were accursed he could not take away the sins of those that believe in 
him. Hence the belief of both Jews and Christians is that Jesus died on the cross, 
and the meaning of the verse is clear, i.e., every Jew and Christian, despite having 
no sure knowledge at all, must believe before his death that Jesus died on the 
cross.

what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you, 
and those who keep up prayer and give the due charity and the 
believers in Allah and the Last Day — these it is to whom We 
shall give a mighty reward. 

Section 23: Previous Revelation and the Quran 

163 Surely We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah 
and the prophets after him, and We revealed to Abraham and 
Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and Jesus and Job and 
Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and We gave to David a scripture. 
164 And (We sent) messengers We have mentioned to you before 
and messengers We have not mentioned to you. And to Moses 
Allah addressed His word, speaking (to him) — 165 messengers, 
bearers of good news " and warners, so that the people may have 
no plea against Allah after the (coming of) messengers. And Allah 
is ever Mighty, Wise. 166 But Allah bears witness by what He has 
revealed to you that He has revealed it with His knowledge, and 
the angels (also) bear witness. And Allah is sufficient as a witness. 

167 Those who disbelieve and hinder (others) from Allah's 
way, they indeed have gone astray, straying far. 168 Those who dis- 
believe and act unjustly, Allah will never forgive them, nor guide 
them to a path, 169 except the path of hell, to abide in it for a long 
time. And that is easy to Allah. 

170 O mankind, the Messenger has indeed come to you with 
truth from your Lord, so believe, it is better for you. And if you 
disbelieve, then surely to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens 
and the earth. And Allah is ever Knowing, Wise. 171 People of 
the Book, do not exaggerate in the matter of your religion nor 
speak anything about Allah but the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son 
of Mary, is only a messenger of Allah and His word* which He 



a (165) The good news which these messengers brought relates as much to 
the peace and happiness which is granted to the righteous as to the advent of one 
who, coming at the end, should unite the qualifications of all the prophets in his 
own person, and accordingly make the nations of the earth as one nation. 

b (171-1) Kalima, or word, is here equivalent to prophecy, in which sense it

communicated to Mary and a mercy from Him. a So believe in 
Allah and His messengers. And do not say, Three. Refrain (from 
it), it is better for you. Allah is only one God. Far be it from His 
glory to have a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens 
and whatever is in the earth. And sufficient is Allah as having 
charge of affairs. 

Section 24: Prophethood of Jesus 

172 The Messiah does not disdain to be a servant of Allah, 
nor do the angels who are near to Him. And whoever disdains His 
service and is proud, He will gather them all together to Himself. 
173 Then as for those who believe and do good, He will pay them 
fully their rewards and give them more out of His grace. And as 
for those who disdain and are proud, He will punish them with a 
painful punishment, and they will find for themselves besides Allah 
no friend nor helper. 

174 O people, manifest proof has indeed come to you from 
your Lord and We have sent down to you a clear light. 17S Then as 
for those who believe in Allah and hold fast by Him, He will admit 
them to His mercy and grace, and guide them to Himself on a right 
path.

sion concerning the person who has neither parents nor children. 

is frequently used in the Quran. Jesus is called a prophecy because he was born in 
accordance with a prophecy from God. 

a (171-2) Ruh also means mercy, as translated here. It also signifies inspira- 
tion or Divine revelation, and if this significance is adopted it would be an expla- 
nation of the foregoing words, i.e. His prophecy which He communicated to Mary. 
Even if we take spirit to be the meaning of the word ruh, it does not take Jesus 
beyond the limits of mortality, because according to the Quran the spirit of God is 
breathed into every human being (32:9). Moreover, the words used here can only 
mean a spirit from Him and not the spirit from Him. 

b (171-3) The doctrine of Trinity is plainly rejected here. There are not three 
persons in Godhead, but only one: Allah is only one God. The Quran nowhere 
says that the Christian Trinity is formed of Jesus, Mary, and God, although it no 
doubt refers to the Roman Catholic doctrine of the worship of Mary in 5:1 16. 



4 : 176 • PROPHETHOOD OF JESUS 137 

If a man dies (and) he has no son and he has a sister, hers is half of 
what he leaves, and he shall be her heir if she has no son. But if 
there are two (sisters), they shall have two-thirds of what he leaves. 
And if there are (both) brothers and sisters, then for the male is the 
like of the portion of two females. Allah makes clear to you, in 
case you go astray. And Allah is Knower of all things." 



a (176) The rule given here supplements the law of inheritance as given at 
the commencement of this chapter. Here there are neither children nor parents and 
therefore the whole of the inheritance goes to the brothers and the sisters. Rever- 
sion to the law of inheritance just after speaking of Jesus has perhaps a deeper 
meaning. It is a fact that no prophet appeared among the Israelites after Jesus, and 
therefore his death really left Israel without a spiritual head who should rise to the 
eminence of prophethood. The spiritual kingdom which was promised to 
Abraham, and which hitherto remained in the house of Israel, was now taken from 
the Israelites and made over to the brother nation, the Ishmaelites. This would 
also explain the words addressed to Moses: "The Lord your God will raise up for 
you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brethren" (Deuteronomy, 
18:15). 



Chapter 5 

Al-Ma'idah Food 

The name of this chapter refers to the demand for food, or physical sus- 
tenance, by the followers of Jesus and the granting of Jesus' prayer for his 
earlier and later followers (verses 1 12-1 15). Not only physical food, but God 
sent down for them spiritual food in the form of the Quran, which "perfected" 
religion (v. 3). The chapter deals with the deviation of the Jews and Chris- 
tians from the truth and their hostility towards Islam. It contains directions 
for Muslims on several points and warns them to avoid the errors into which 
previous nations fell. It ends with a refutation of the doctrine of Jesus' divinity 
and gives hope of the deliverance of his followers from this wrong belief. 
This chapter was mainly revealed in 5-7 A.H. However, v. 3, speaking of the 
perfection of religion in Islam, was revealed during the Holy Prophet's last 
pilgrimage to Makkah in 10 A.H.

Thus respect for law, religious as well as temporal, is taught here.

in connection with the security of the Ka'bah in verses 94-96, so that even wild 
animals are secure during this time.

these ceremonies are performed are also known by this name.

Sacred Month, nor the offerings, nor the victims with garlands," 
nor those repairing to the Sacred House seeking the grace and 
pleasure of their Lord. And when you are free from pilgrimage 
obligations, then hunt. And do not let hatred of a people — 
because they hindered you from the Sacred Mosque — incite you 
to transgress. And help one another in righteousness and piety, 
and do not help one another in sin and aggression, and keep your 
duty to Allah.' Surely Allah is Severe in retribution. 

3 Forbidden to you is what dies of itself, and blood, and flesh 
of swine, and that on which any other name than that of Allah has 
been invoked, and the strangled (animal), and that beaten to death, 
and that killed by a fall, and that killed by goring with the horn, 
and what wild beasts have eaten — except what you slaughter; 
and what is sacrificed on stones set up (for idols), 8 and (it is for- 
bidden) that you seek to divide by arrows; that is a transgression. 
This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so 
do not fear them, and fear Me. This day have I perfected for you 
your religion and completed My favour to you and chosen for you 



a (2-2) Hady or "offering" means what is driven (to Makkah). Qald'id or 
"victims with garlands" means necklaces or what is put upon the neck of an ani- 
mal that is brought as an offering to Makkah for sacrifice. Only camels are made 
to wear garlands, while hady includes all kinds of animals brought as offering. 

b (2-3) The principle laid down here requires from Muslims equal treatment 
for all nations, for those whom we hate as well as for those whom we love. Only 
this principle of Islam can serve as the basis for an international code for the 
modern world and an international law. 

c (2-4) Editor 's Note: Muslims ought only to cooperate with one another in 
matters of goodness, and are forbidden to help each other in wrongdoing against 
others. This injunction prohibits the evils of blind patriotism and unconditional 
support for one's own people even when they commit injustices against others. 

d (3-1) The meaning is that if an animal partly eaten by wild beasts is found 
while yet alive, and is slaughtered in the proper manner, its flesh is allowed. 

e (3-2) Certain stones were set up around the Ka'bah, over or near which it 
was customary for the idolaters to kill animals as offerings to certain idols. 

/(3-3) This prohibits dividing the flesh of slaughtered animals by means of 
certain arrows with which the idolatrous Arabs played a game of chance.

inclining wilfully to sin, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

4 They askyou as to what is allowed them. Say: The good 
things are allowed to you, and what you have taught the beasts 
and birds of prey, training them to hunt — you teach them of what 
Allah has taught you; so eat of what they catch for you and 
mention the name of Allah over it; and keep your duty to Allah. 
Surely Allah is Swift in reckoning. 5 This day (all) good things are 
made lawful for you. And the food of those who have been given 
the Book is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. c And 
so are the chaste from among the believing women and the chaste 
from among those who have been given the Book before you, 
when you give them their dowries, taking (them) in marriage, not 
fornicating nor taking them for lovers in secret. And whoever 



a (3-4) This verse was revealed towards the close of the Holy Prophet's life, 
and it is held by all authorities that no precept was revealed after this. It is a clear 
testimony to the perfection of religion in Islam, no such claim being made by any 
other book or religion. Just before the Holy Prophet Muhammad, Jesus had said: 
"I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. However, 
when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth" (John, 
16:12-13). The Prophet Muhammad was thus the last of the prophets, because 
religion being perfected, no prophet was needed after him. 

b (4) Game killed by means of beasts and birds of prey taught to hunt is 
allowed. When the beast or the bird is sent after the prey, the name of Allah 
should be mentioned. Game killed by an arrow or by a shot is allowed, subject to 
the same condition. If the game is not killed before it falls into the hands of the 
hunter, it should be slaughtered; if it is already killed, it is lawful in that condition. 

c (5-1) Thus animals slaughtered by the Jews or the Christians are allowed 
when slaughtered in the name of God. However, any food which is clearly prohi- 
bited cannot become lawful because it is offered by a Jew or a Christian. 

d (5-2) In Islam intermarriages with idol-worshippers are totally prohibited 
(2:221), but in the case of a people whose religion is based on a revealed book, in 
which category fall almost all the nations of the world, the taking of their women 
in marriage is expressly allowed. The giving away of Muslim women in marriage 
to followers of other religions is not, however, expressly mentioned, and practice 
from the earliest times is against it. {Editor 's Note: A Jewish or Christian woman 
marrying a Muslim man would enter a household where her prophets and scrip- 
tures are believed in; while in the converse case a Muslim woman would be 
entering a household where the Prophet Muhammad and the Quran are not

among the losers. 

Section 2: Duty of Uprightness 

6 O you who believe, when you rise up for prayer, wash your 
faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads, and 
(wash) your feet up to the ankles. And if you are under an obliga- 
tion," then wash (your body). And if you are sick, or on a journey, 
or one of you has come from the toilet, or you have had (sexual) 
contact with women, and you cannot find water, then resort to pure 
earth and wipe your faces and your hands with it. Allah does not 
desire to place a burden on you but He wishes to purify you, and 
that He may complete His favour on you, so that you may give 
thanks. 

7 And remember Allah's favour on you and His covenant with 
which He bound you when you said: We have heard and we obey. 
And keep your duty to Allah. Surely Allah is Knower of what is in 
the hearts. 

8 O you who believe, be upright for Allah, bearers of witness 
with justice; and do not let hatred of a people incite you not to act 
equitably. Be just; that is nearer to observance of duty. And keep 
your duty to Allah. Surely Allah is Aware of what you do. 9 AUah 
has promised to those who believe and do good deeds: For them is 
forgiveness and a mighty reward. 10 And those who disbelieve and 
reject Our messages, such are the companions of the flaming fire.

a people had determined to stretch out their hands against you, but 
He withheld their hands from you; and keep your duty to Allah. 
And on Allah let the believers rely. 6

the People of the Book only under the condition that the two of them follow the 
same code of sexual morality as would apply if both of them were Muslims.)

and to exterminate the Muslims on occasions too numerous to mention.

Section 3: Christian Violation of the Covenant 

12 And certainly Allah made a covenant with the Children of 
Israel, and We raised up among them twelve chieftains." And Allah 
said: Surely I am with you. If you keep up prayer and give the due 
charity and believe in My messengers and assist them and offer to 
Allah a goodly gift, I will certainly cover your evil deeds, and 
make you enter Gardens in which rivers flow. But whoever among 
you disbelieves after that, he indeed strays from the right way. 
13 But on account of their breaking their covenant We cursed them 
and hardened their hearts. They alter words from their places and 
neglect a portion of what they were reminded of. And you will 
always discover treachery in them excepting a few of them — so 
pardon them and forgive. Surely Allah loves those who do good 
(to others). 14 And with those who say, We are Christians, We 
made a covenant, but they neglected a portion of what they were 
reminded of, so We stirred up enmity and hatred among them to 
the day of Resurrection/ And Allah will soon inform them of what 
they did. 

15 O People of the Book, indeed Our Messenger has come to 
you, making clear to you much of what you concealed of the Book 
and passing over much. Indeed, there has come to you from Allah, 



a (12) See the Bible, Book of Numbers, 1:5-16 and 1:44. 

b (14-1) The covenant, made through Jesus, was to accept the Prophet when 
he appeared. Jesus told his followers: "I still have many things to say to you, but 
you cannot bear them now. However, when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he 
will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but what- 
ever he hears he will speak" (John 16:12-13). 

c (14-2) The prophecy that there shall always be hatred and enmity between 
the various Christian peoples has proved true in all ages, and never more clearly 
than in modern times with the World Wars in Europe. 

d (15-1) There were many truths which the Jews and the Christians had lost, 
their scriptures not having remained free from corruption, and many which were 
in their books but which they did not act upon. Those which were of permanent 
value were revealed in the Quran, but others — referred to in passing over much 
— that only suited the requirements of the earlier times were not now needed.

a Light and a clear Book," 16 by which Allah guides such as follow 
His pleasure into the ways of peace, and brings them out of dark- 
ness into light by His will, and guides them to the right path. 

17 They indeed disbelieve who say: Surely, Allah — He is the 
Messiah, son of Mary. Say: Who then could control anything as 
against Allah when He wished to destroy the Messiah, son of 
Mary, and his mother and all those on the earth? And Allah's is 
the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between 
them. He creates what He pleases. And Allah is Powerful over all 
things. 

18 And the Jews and the Christians say: We are the sons of 
Allah and His beloved ones. c Say: Why does He then punish you 
for your sins? Rather, you are mortals from among those whom 
He has created. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom 
He pleases.'' And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the 
earth and all that is between them, and to Him is the eventual 
coming. 19 People of the Book, indeed Our Messenger has come 
to you explaining to you after a cessation of the messengers, 6 in 
case you say: No bearer of good news came to us nor a warner. So 
indeed a bearer of good news and a warner has come to you. And 
Allah is Powerful over all things. 



a (15-2) The Light is the Holy Prophet, and the Book, the Quran. 

b (17) The meaning is that Jesus and Mary, and all those who were then on 
the earth, tasted equally of death; hence Jesus was a mortal and not God. 

c (18-1) In the Gospels it is said: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they 
shall be called the children of God" (Matthew, 5:9). The Christians think they are 
the people spoken of here. The Jews considered themselves as the favourite nation, 
because they thought they were the only nation chosen by God for the gift of 
Divine revelation, to the exclusion of all other nations of the world. 

d (18-2) It is in accordance with Divine laws that forgiveness and punish- 
ment are exercised, and the alleged atonement of Jesus brought no change in this. 

e (19) Several centuries had elapsed since the appearance of any prophet in 
any country when the great Arabian Prophet made his appearance. No nation in 
the world claims the appearance of any messenger in it between the advent of 
Jesus Christ and that of the Holy Prophet Muhammad. The world was, as it were, 
preparing itself for the advent of the greatest of all prophets, who was to be a 
messenger to all the nations of the world.

Section 4: Israelites' Violation of the Covenant 

20 And when Moses said to his people: My people, remember 
the favour of Allah to you when He raised prophets among you 
and made you kings and gave you what He did not give to any 
other of the nations." 21 My people, enter the Holy Land which 
Allah has ordained for you and do not turn your backs, for then you 
will turn back losers. 22 They said: Moses, in it are a powerful 
people, and we shall not enter it until they go out from it; if they 
go out from it, then surely we will enter. 23 Two men of those who 
feared, on whom Allah had bestowed a favour, said: Enter upon 
them by the gate, for when you enter it you will surely be victo- 
rious; and put your trust in Allah, if you are believers. ' 24 They 
said: Moses, we will never enter it so long as they are in it; go 
therefore you and your Lord, and fight; surely here we sit. 25 He 
said: My Lord, I have control of none but my own self and my 
brother; so distinguish between us and the transgressing people. 
26 He said: It will surely be forbidden to them for forty years — 
they will wander about in the land. e So do not grieve for the trans- 
gressing people. 

Section 5: Cain and Abel 

27 And relate to them with truth the story of the two sons of 
Adam, when they offered an offering, but it was accepted from 
one of them and was not accepted from the other. He said: I will 
certainly kill you. (The other) said: Allah accepts only from the 
dutiful. 28 If you stretch out your hand against me to kill me I shall 



a (20) The reference need not be to the earlier history of the Israelites, but to 
their history as dating from the time of Moses, for the advent of Moses had 
brought about an entire change both in their spiritual and political status. 

b (23) These were Joshua and Caleb. See Numbers, 14:6-9. 

c (26) See Numbers 14:23. The forty years spoken of here represent the life 
of that generation. 

d (27) The reference is apparently to the story of Cain and Abel. Compare 
Genesis 4:3-12. But the story may be taken allegorically, where the Israelites may 
be taken for the aggressive and sinful brother and the Ishmaelites, as represented 
by the Holy Prophet, for the righteous one. 



5 : 29 • CAIN AND ABEL 145 

not stretch out my hand against you to kill you. Surely I fear 
Allah, the Lord of the worlds: 29 I would rather that you should 
bear the sin against me and your own sin, a thus you would be one 
of the companions of the Fire; and that is the recompense of the 
unjust. 30 At length his mind made it easy for him to kill his 
brother, so he killed him; then he became one of the losers. 31 Then 
Allah sent a crow scratching the ground to show him how to cover 
the dead body of his brother. He said: Woe is me! Am I not able to 
be as this crow and cover the dead body of my brother? So he 
became regretful. 

32 For this reason We prescribed for the Children of Israel 
that whoever kills a person, unless it is for manslaughter or for 
mischief in the land, it is as though he had killed all mankind. 
And whoever saves a life, it is as though he had saved the lives of 
all mankind. And certainly Our messengers came to them with clear 
arguments, but even after that many of them commit excesses in 
the land. 33 The only punishment of those who wage war against 
Allah and His Messenger and strive to make mischief in the land c 
is that they should be murdered, or crucified, or their hands and 
their feet should be cut off on opposite sides, or they should be 



a (29) The words "the sin against me" are literally "my sin" but here mean 
the sin committed against me, i.e. the sin of murder. By "your sin" is meant his 
previous sin on account of which his offering was not accepted. The righteous 
brother tells the wicked one that even after knowing that he intended to kill him 
he would not be the first to raise his hand against him and kill him, but he would 
rather that the guilty one should go on adding to his sins. 

b (32) The reference is generally understood to be to the gravity of the crime 
of murder. 

c (33-1) This has generally been accepted as referring to armed robbers and 
murderers who cause disorder and loss of life and property in a settled state of 
society, and not to those who actually wage war. The punishment to be inflicted in 
any particular case would depend upon the circumstances of the case, as well as 
the time and place where the crime was committed. (Editor 's Note: Some recent 
commentators suggest that these words do not convey commands to apply these 
punishments as legal penalties, but describe the natural consequences that occur in 
society as a result of the actions of the perpetrators of such crimes.)

imprisoned. This shall be a disgrace for them in this world, and in 
the Hereafter they shall have a grievous punishment, 34 except those 
who repent before you overpower them; so know that Allah is 
Forgiving, Merciful. 

Section 6: Punishment of Offenders 

35 O you who believe, keep your duty to Allah, and seek 
means of nearness to Him, and strive hard in His way that you may 
be successful. 36 Those who disbelieve, even if they had all that is 
in the earth, and as much as it again, to ransom themselves with it 
from the punishment of the day of Resurrection, it would not be 
accepted from them; and theirs is a painful punishment. 37 They 
would desire to come forth from the Fire, and they will not come 
forth from it, and theirs is a lasting punishment. 

38 And (as for) the man and the woman addicted to theft, cut 
off their hands as a penalty for what they have earned — an 
exemplary punishment from Allah. And Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
39 But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms, Allah 
will turn to him (mercifully). Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
40 Do you not know that Allah is He to Whom belongs the king- 
dom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He pleases, 



a (33-2) These words literally mean they should he banished from the earth, 
but are mostly accepted as meaning imprisonment. Deportation is also included if 
we take "earth" as meaning a particular country. 

b (38) The cutting off of hands may be taken metaphorically or literally. If 
taken metaphorically, it would simply mean restraining the thief by imprisonment 
or otherwise. If taken literally, it must be emphasized that it is the maximum 
punishment, and whether it is inflicted would depend on the circumstances of the 
case. This punishment is called exemplary, and exemplary punishment could only 
be inflicted where the crime is very serious or the offender is a habitual criminal. 
The next verse shows that the punishment of cutting off the hand is only for a 
criminal who does not reform, i.e. for the habitual offender. Moreover, what is 
required is repentance and reform. To give a man a chance to reform it is 
necessary that he should be given freedom of action before the more serious 
punishment is inflicted. I translate the word al-sariq as meaning one addicted to 
theft, not only for the reasons given above but also because an explanatory read- 
ing of this word is al-sarriq, which is a noun of intensiveness, from the same root.

and forgives whom He pleases. And Allah is Powerful over all 
things. 

41 O Messenger, do not let those grieve you who hasten to 
disbelief, from among those who say with their mouths, We 
believe, and their hearts do not believe, and from among those 
who are Jews — they are listeners for the sake of a lie, listeners 
for another people who have not come to you." They alter words 
after they are put in their (proper) places, saying: If you are given 
this, take it, and if you are not given this, be cautious. And he for 
whom Allah intends temptation, you control nothing for him 
against Allah. Those are they whose hearts Allah does not intend 
to purify. For them is disgrace in this world, and for them a 
grievous punishment in the Hereafter. 42 Listeners for the sake of a 
lie, devourers of forbidden things, so if they come to you, judge 
between them or turn away from them. And if you turn away from 
them, they cannot harm you at all. And if you judge, judge 
between them with equity. Surely Allah loves the equitable. 
43 And how do they make you a judge and they have the Torah in 
which is Allah's judgment? Yet they turn away after that! And 
these are not believers. 

Section 7: The Quran and Previous Scriptures 

44 Surely We revealed the Torah, having guidance and light. e 



a (41) The meaning is that they listen, but their object is only to invent lies 
and to give false reports to people who have not come to the Holy Prophet. 

b (42) By the agreement drawn up between the various nationalities of 
Madinah on the advent of the Holy Prophet there (see 2:84 footnote), all disputes 
were to be referred to the Holy Prophet, but the Jews had by this time become so 
inimical to the Prophet that he is allowed to refuse to judge between them. In case 
he judged between them, he is still told to judge with equity. To be equitable, 
despite their severe enmity, shows that the Prophet had reached the highest point 
of moral rectitude to which man can attain. 

c (44-1) Verses 44-47 do not provide evidence of the purity of the text of the 
Bible as we have it. That the Torah was a Divine revelation containing light and 
guidance has never been denied. What is denied is that that light and guidance 
were kept intact throughout the ages. It is further denied that these two books 
were meant for the whole world and for all ages.

By it did the prophets who submitted themselves (to Allah) judge 
for the Jews, and the rabbis and the doctors of law, because they 
were required to guard the Book of Allah," and they were wit- 
nesses of it. So do not fear the people and fear Me, and do not take 
a small price for My messages. And whoever does not judge by 
what Allah has revealed, those are the disbelievers. 45 And We 
prescribed to them in it that life is for life, and eye for eye, and 
nose for nose, and ear for ear, and tooth for tooth, and for wounds 
retaliation. But whoever forgoes it, it shall be an expiation for him. c 
And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, those are 
the wrongdoers. 

46 And We sent after them in their footsteps Jesus, son of 
Mary, verifying what was (already) before him of the Torah; and 
We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light, and 
verifying what was before it of the Torah, and a guidance and an 
admonition for the dutiful. 47 And let the People of the Gospel judge 
by what Allah has revealed in it. And whoever does not judge by 
what Allah has revealed, those are the transgressors. 



a (44-2) They were required to guard the Book of God but nonetheless 
alterations were made in it as stated in 2:75 and 2:79. 

b (44-3) By judging is not meant only the judging of civil or criminal cases, 
but judging in all matters of religion, so that those who did not judge the revela- 
tion of the Holy Prophet by what was revealed in the Torah were disbelievers. 
The adoption of the words what Allah has revealed instead of the Torah is signifi- 
cant. It shows that the whole of the Torah as existing then was not looked upon by 
the Quran as being the Divine revelation. 

c (45) If a man forgoes his right to an act of reprisal against his brother, this 
shall be an expiation for any wrong he may have done. 

d (46) The description of the Gospel as containing light and guidance 
conveys the same significance as the similar statement regarding the Torah in v. 
44. In addition it is stated that the Gospel verified the Torah despite the fact that it 
introduces many new doctrines in place of those given in the Mosaic law. This 
clearly shows that by verification is meant only corroboration of the general prin- 
ciples and broad doctrines of the faith, such as the unity of God and equitable 
dealing with people, or the declaration by one prophet of the truth of a previous 
prophet, as the declaration of the truth of Moses by Jesus and of both by the Holy 
Prophet. It is in this sense that the Quran is spoken of as verifying the Torah and 
the Gospel. 



5 : 48 • QURAN AND PREVIOUS SCRIPTURES 149 

48 And We have revealed to you the Book with the truth, 
verifying what is (already) before it of the Book and a guardian 
over it," so judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and 
do not follow their low desires, (turning away) from the truth that 
has come to you. For everyone of you We appointed a law and a 
way. And if Allah had pleased He would have made you a single 
people, but that He might try you in what He gave you. e So vie 
with one another in good works. To Allah you will all return, so 
He will inform you of that in which you differed; 49 and that you 
should judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do 
not follow their low desires, and be cautious of them that they do 
not seduce you from part of what Allah has revealed to you. Then 
if they turn away, know that Allah desires to afflict them for some 
of their sins. And surely many of the people are transgressors. 50 Is 
it then the judgment of ignorance that they desire? And who is 
better than Allah to judge for a people who are sure? 



a (48-1) Being a guardian over all previous revelation shows that whatever 
was of permanent value in the previous scriptures has been preserved in the Quran. 
The previous books contained a light and guidance for the people for whom they 
were meant, and they were commanded to judge by those books, but the Quran is 
now the Book which judges all truth, wherever it may have been. 

b (48-2) The appointment of a law and a way for everyone refers to the 
giving of different laws to different nations in accordance with their requirements 
before the revelation of the Quran, which fulfilled the requirements of all nations 
and all ages. Thus the Quran here recognizes the principle to which it refers fre- 
quently, that prophets were raised among every people, for which see particularly 
10:47, 13:7 and 35:24. 

c (48-3) One significance is that man is placed above the whole of creation 
in that he has been granted discretionary powers. Hence, people follow different 
ways, adopting different sects. If man had not been granted these powers, all 
humans would have been a single people, but then man's better qualities would 
not have been manifested. The words may, however, also mean "if Allah pleases 
He will make you a single people", referring to the ultimate destiny of the human 
race. In fact all people are now growing to the consciousness that they are all but 
one nation. (Editor's Note: These words, along with what follows in this verse, 
also indicate that all religions, though they are different, set before their adherents 
the same goal of doing good works, and therefore the followers of each religion 
should try to excel followers of other religions, or vie with them, in the doing of 
good works. That is how God tries adherents of every religion in this life.)

Section 8: Relations of Muslims with Enemies 

51 O you who believe, do not take the Jews and the Christians 
for friends. They are friends of each other. And whoever among 
you takes them for friends he is indeed one of them. Surely Allah 
does not guide the unjust people." 52 But you see those in whose 
hearts is a disease, hastening towards them, saying: We fear that a 
calamity may befall us.* Maybe Allah will bring the victory or a 
commandment from Himself/ so they will regret what they hid in 
their souls. 53 And those who believe will say: Are these they who 
swore by Allah with their most forcible oaths that they were 
surely with you? Their deeds will be fruitless, so they will be 
losers. 

54 O you who believe, if anyone of you should turn back 
from his religion, then Allah will bring a people whom He loves 
and who love Him, humble towards the believers, mighty against 
the disbelievers, striving hard in Allah's way and not fearing the 
censure of any censurer. This is Allah's grace — He gives it 
to whom He pleases. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing. 



a (51) All non-believers, whatever their own differences, had made common 
cause against Islam; this is what is meant by their being friends of each other. 
Muslims are warned that they should not expect help or friendship from any party 
of them, whether Jews, Christians, or idolaters. It would have been weakness of 
faith in the ultimate triumph of Islam if, from fear of a powerful enemy, they had 
sought help and friendship here and there among a hostile people, as the next 
verse shows. See 60:7-9 which make it clear that the prohibition against friendly 
relations with the disbelievers was only temporary, to be operative only so long as 
the war continued. Those verses settle conclusively that friendly relations between 
Muslims and non-Muslims, as such, are not prohibited. 

b (52-1) By hastening towards them is meant hastening to make friendship 
with them or seeking their help, fearing a Muslim reverse. 

c (52-2) Bringing about a commandment refers to the establishment of the 
rule of Islam, by which is meant the dominance of Islam, there being a further 
reference to the spiritual conquests of Islam in v. 54. 

d (54) Muslims were severely persecuted while at Makkah and their troubles 
at Madinah increased manifold owing to the presence of warring tribes on all 
sides. Yet they faced all these hardships with the greatest perseverance, and cases 
of apostasy were rare.

believe, those who keep up prayer and give the due charity, and 
they bow down. 56 And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger 
and those who believe for friend — surely the party of Allah, they 
shall triumph. 

Section 9: Those who mock 

57 O you who believe, do not take for friends those who take 
your religion as a mockery and a sport, from among those who 
were given the Book before you and the disbelievers; and keep 
your duty to Allah if you are believers." 58 And when you call to 
prayer they take it as a mockery and a sport. That is because they 
are a people who do not understand. 

59 Say: O People of the Book, do you find fault with us for 
only that we believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us 
and what was revealed before, while most of you are trans- 
gressors? 60 Say: Shall I inform you of those worse than this in 
retribution from Allah? They are those whom Allah has cursed 
and upon whom He brought His wrath and of whom He made apes 
and swine, and who serve the devil. These are in a worse plight 
and further astray from the straight path. 61 And when they come to 
you, they say, We believe, and surely they come in unbelief and 
they go forth in it. And Allah knows best what they conceal. 
62 And you see many of them hastening to (commit) sin and trans- 
gression, and their devouring unlawful gain. Certainly evil is what 
they do. 63 Why do not the rabbis and the doctors of law prohibit 
them from their sinful utterances and their devouring unlawful 
gain? Certainly evil are the works they do. 



a (57) Muslims were prohibited from having friendly relations with those 
who mocked their religion and their Prophet. Friendship with such people would 
indeed have led to a similar bent of mind. (Editor 's Note: This again makes clear 
that friendship is only disallowed with disbelievers when they behave in a hostile 
way towards Islam. Muslims are nowhere required to attack physically or punish 
those who mock their religion, but only withdraw friendship temporarily.) 

b (63) Editor's Note: It is for their committing of evil deeds, the sins prohibi- 
ted in their own scriptures, that the Jews are here condemned. Verses 65 and 66

64 And the Jews say: The hand of Allah is tied up. Their own 
hands are fettered and they are cursed for what they say. No, both 
His hands are spread out." He disburses as He pleases. And what 
has been revealed to you from jour Lord will certainly make many 
of them increase in inordinacy and disbelief. And We have cast 
among them enmity and hatred till the day of Resurrection. 
Whenever they kindle a fire for war Allah puts it out, and they 
strive to make mischief in the land. And Allah does not love the 
mischief-makers. 65 And if the People of the Book had believed 
and kept their duty We would certainly have removed from them 
their evils, and made them enter gardens of bliss. 66 And if they had 
observed the Torah and the Gospel and what is revealed to them 
from their Lord, they would certainly have eaten from above them 
and from beneath their feet. Some of them keep to the moderate 
course; but most of them — evil is what they do. e 



make it clear that Jews and Christians should not have violated the good teachings 
of their own scriptures and that there were some of them who did not. 

a (64-1) Muslims as a community were mostly poor people who accepted 
the truth. Jews on the other hand carried on business and were rich, hence they 
taunted Muslims, saying that Allah's hand was fettered. See also 3:181. The words 
"both His hands are spread out" indicate that God will enrich Muslims materially 
as well as spiritually. 

b (64-2) The casting of enmity among them may relate to the enmity 
between the Jews and the Christians, because both are again and again referred to 
in this chapter. {Editor 's Note: That enmity has existed throughout their history, 
culminating in the atrocities against the Jews in Europe in the 20th century.) 

c (66) If they had observed the Torah and the Gospel which contained clear 
prophecies of the Prophet's advent, they would have believed in the revelation of 
the Quran as well. The eating from above is in reference to spiritual blessings and 
eating from beneath their feet signifies the earthly provisions; i.e., they would 
have had abundance of both. The attitude of liberality adopted by Islam towards 
even its most implacable foes is remarkable. Despite their strong enmity to Islam, 
some Jews and Christians are described as keeping to the moderate course. 
(Editor 's Note: It may also be meant that if Jews and Christians had acted on the 
moral teachings of their respective scriptures they would at least have not opposed 
the Prophet Muhammad, still less tried to destroy Islam.) 



5 : 67 • CHRISTIAN DEVIATION FROM THE TRUTH 153 

Section 10: Christian Deviation from the Truth 

67 O Messenger, deliver what has been revealed to you from 
your Lord; and if you do not, you have not delivered His message. 
And Allah will protect you from people. Surely Allah does not 
guide the disbelieving people." 

68 Say: O People of the Book, you follow no good till you 
observe the Torah and the Gospel and what is revealed to you 
from your Lord. And surely what has been revealed to you from 
your Lord will make many of them increase in inordinacy and dis- 
belief; so do not grieve for the disbelieving people. 69 Surely those 
who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabians and the 
Christians — whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and 
does good — they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve. 

70 Certainly We made a covenant with the Children of Israel 
and We sent to them messengers. Whenever a messenger came to 
them with what their souls did not desire, some (of them) they 
called liars and some they (even) sought to kill. 71 And they 
thought that there would be no affliction,* so they became blind 
and deaf; then Allah turned to them (mercifully) but many of them 
(again) became blind and deaf. c And Allah is Seer of what they do. 



a (67) The promise is given here that the Holy Prophet will remain under 
Divine protection as against the innumerable dangers that threatened him from all 
quarters and the numerous plots against his life. But it also refers to the Prophet' s 
spiritual protection. God protects prophets by creating them pure from every sin 
in their very nature, keeping them firm in trials, sending down tranquillity upon 
them and protecting their hearts against evil. 

b (71-1) Although they had been repeatedly warned of the afflictions which 
would befall them, they still thought that, being a favoured nation, they would not 
suffer punishment for their evil deeds. They had been subjected to great sufferings 
at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian rulers who followed him, 
large numbers having been slain and the rest taken prisoners. And again they suf- 
fered at the hands of Titus. See v. 78 where this affliction is spoken of as coming 
after David and Jesus. 

c (71-2) Allah's turning mercifully to them signifies the advent of Jesus, and 
their becoming blind and deaf a second time refers to their rejection of him. 



154 5. FOOD «5:72 

72 Certainly they disbelieve who say: Allah, He is the Messiah, 
son of Mary. And the Messiah said: O Children of Israel, serve 
Allah, my Lord and your Lord." Surely whoever sets up partners 
with Allah, Allah has forbidden to him the Garden and his abode 
is the Fire. And for the wrongdoers there will be no helpers. 
73 Certainly they disbelieve who say: Allah is the third of the three. 
And there is no God but One God. And if they do not refrain from 
what they say, a painful punishment will surely befall such of 
them as disbelieved 74 Will they not then turn to Allah and ask His 
forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

75 The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a messenger — 
messengers had indeed passed away before him. And his mother 
was a truthful woman. They both used to eat food. See how We 
make the messages clear to them, then see how they are turned 
away (from truth)! 76 Say: Do you serve besides Allah that which 
controls for you neither harm nor benefit? And Allah — He is the 
Hearing, the Knowing. 77 Say: O People of the Book, do not 
exaggerate in the matter of your religion unjustly, nor follow the 



a (72) "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve" 
(Matthew, 4:10). 

b (73-1) The well-known Christian doctrine of the Trinity is here plainly 
referred to. It should be noted that the name of Mary is never mentioned in 
connection with the doctrine of the Trinity. But as the Christians, especially the 
Roman Catholics, invested Mary with Divine character, as being the mother of 
God, the Quran often mentions her along with Jesus as being an ordinary mortal. 

c (73-2) The doctrine of the Atonement has slowly and gradually made the 
Christian world forget God altogether, and material advancement and the 
acquisition of worldly power has become their only concern. They first sought to 
subjugate the whole world, and, having done that, they are now seeking to 
overpower each other. Their mutual hatred and enmity as a punishment for their 
violation of the covenant of God has been already clearly spoken of in v. 14, and 
again in v. 64, as also in an earlier revelation: "And on that day We shall let some 
of them surge against others" (18:99). 

d (75) Feeling hungry and partaking of food shows that both Jesus and his 
mother were ordinary mortals. Every living thing needs food; it is only the 
Supreme Being Who has no need of it. As Jesus is clearly spoken of as eating 
food while alive, he could not remain alive without food, and this verse thus 
negatives the allegation that Jesus is still alive.

and went astray from the right path. a 

Section 1 1 : Christian Nearness to Islam 

78 Those who disbelieved from among the Children of Israel 
were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary. This 
was because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits. 79 They did 
not forbid one another the hateful things they did. Evil indeed was 
what they did. 80 Ybu see many of them befriending those who 
disbelieve. Certainly evil is what their souls send ahead for them, 
so that Allah is displeased with them, and in punishment will they 
abide. 81 And if they believed in Allah and the Prophet c and what 
is revealed to him, they would not take them for friends, but most 
of them are transgressors. 82 Fou will certainly find the most 
violent of people in enmity against the believers to be the Jews 
and the idolaters; and you will find the nearest in friendship to the 
believers to be those who say, We are Christians. That is because 



a (77) The exaggeration spoken of here refers to the Christian doctrine 
raising a mortal to the dignity of Godhead. The Christians are here told that in 
making this doctrine the basis of their religion they have only followed an erro- 
neous doctrine preached by people before them. Recent criticism has shown that 
the Christians have only followed previous idolatrous nations in ascribing a son to 
God. This subject has been fully discussed in The Sources of Christianity by the 
late Khwaja Kamal-ud-Din. 

b (78) After Moses, David and Jesus, who represent the highest achievement 
of Israelite prophethood in temporal and spiritual glory, spoke of the advent of the 
Holy Prophet in unmistakable terms. The curse is used here in its original sense of 
being removed further off from Divine mercy. Both prophets had warned the Jews 
that their transgressions called for Divine punishment which should soon overtake 
them if they did not mend their ways. The time of both was followed by a great 
affliction overtaking the Jews, in the respective depredations of the Babylonian 
kings and the destruction wrought by Titus. 

c (81) By al-Nabl or the Prophet in the Quran is always meant the Holy 
Prophet Muhammad, and he is often spoken of and addressed as al-Nabi or al- 
Rasul, the Prophet or the Messenger. In fact, he is referred to as the Prophet or 
that Prophet in earlier prophecy as well (John 1:21 ,25). The Jews professed belief 
in the Unity of God, yet they made a common cause with the idolatrous 
Quraish to uproot Islam which was a religion of pure monotheism.

83 And when they hear what has been revealed to the 
Messenger you see their eyes overflow with tears because of the 
truth they recognize. They say: Our Lord, we believe, so write us 
down with the witnesses.* 84 And what (reason) have we that we 
should not believe in Allah and in the Truth that has come to us, 
while we earnestly desire that our Lord should make us enter with 
the righteous people? 85 So Allah rewarded them for what they 
said, with Gardens in which rivers flow, to abide in them. And 
that is the reward of the doers of good. 86 And those who dis- 
believe and reject Our messages, such are the companions of the 
flaming fire. 

Section 12: Warning of Sins of Previous People 

87 O you who believe, do not forbid the good things which 
Allah has made lawful for you, nor exceed the limits. Surely Allah 



a (82) The Christians were nearer to Islam than the Jews, not only because 
the Muslims accepted Jesus as a prophet of God, but because there were still 
among them many people who feared and worshipped God. In the Holy Prophet's 
own time, the Negus, Christian Emperor of Abyssinia, accepted Islam; Heraclius, 
the Byzantine ruler, was favourably disposed towards it; and even the Christian 
deputation of Najran towards the end of the Prophet's life was impressed with the 
Prophet's arguments. But the words here are more of a prophetical nature. In the 
early history of Islam, Christians in Egypt, North Africa, Syria, Persia and other 
countries, accepted Islam in very large numbers and at present, too, when Islam is 
being presented to the West, the Christians are receiving the message with an 
open heart. 

b (83) This refers to the Christians who believed. An important such person- 
age was the Negus of Abyssinia, in whose dominions the Muslims found shelter 
in the early days of the Prophet's mission, when compelled to flee from Makkah 
on account of the severe persecutions of the Quraish. When the portion of the 
chapter of the Quran entitled 'Mary' dealing with Jesus Christ was read out to 
him, the words so impressed him that he wept and said that Jesus was not one 
whit more than the Quran described him to be. That he subsequently became a 
true convert to Islam is clearly shown by a funeral service having been held for 
him by the Holy Prophet when news of his death reached Madinah.

lawful and good (things) that Allah has given you, and keep your 
duty to Allah, in Whom you believe. 89 Allah will not call you to 
account for what is vain in your oaths, but He will call you to 
account for the making of deliberate oaths; so its expiation* is the 
feeding often poor persons with the average (food) you feed your 
families with, or their clothing, or the freeing of a slave. But 
whoever does not find (means) should fast for three days. This is 
the expiation of your oaths when you swear. And keep your oaths. 
Thus does Allah make clear to you His messages that you may 
give thanks.

(sacrificing to) stones set up and (dividing by) arrows e are only an 
uncleanness, the devil's work; so shun it that you may succeed/ 
91 The devil desires only to create enmity and hatred among you by

a (87) Muslims are told on the one hand not to follow the self-imposed 
restrictions of Christian monks and priests, and at the same time they are warned 
against depriving themselves of Divine blessings by falling into evil habits. 

b (89) The oaths referred to are in relation to vows, etc., by which one 
forbids oneself what is otherwise lawful. The injunction at the end of this verse, 
keep your oaths, also shows that oaths cannot be violated generally, and therefore 
expiation is only allowed in the case of oaths by which a person deprives himself 
of some lawful thing or of an occasion of virtue, as in 2:226. 

c (90-1) For "stones set up" and "dividing by arrows" see 5:3 footnotes 2 
and 3. 

d (90-2) This verse totally prohibits all intoxicants and games of chance; and 
besides, by classing them with sacrifices to stones set up for idols and dividing by 
arrows, subjects them to the prohibition of 5:3. It is related that when this verse 
was revealed a crier proclaimed in the streets of Madinah that wine was prohibi- 
ted, and in response to this every jar of wine in a Muslim house was emptied, so 
that wine flowed in the streets (Bukhari, 46:20). Never in the history of the world 
was such a deep-rooted evil as drink so suddenly yet so completely eradicated. 

e (91) Only one very clear reason is here given why intoxicants and games 
of chance are forbidden. Elsewhere it is clearly stated that in intoxicants and 
games of chance there is a great sin (2:219).

they keep their duty and believe and do good deeds, then keep 
their duty and believe, then keep their duty and do good (to others). 
And Allah loves the doers of good. 

Section 13: Inviolability of the Ka'bah 

94 O you who believe, Allah will certainly try you in respect 
of some game which your hands and your lances can reach, that 
Allah may know who fears Him in secret. Whoever exceeds the 
limit after this, for him is a painful punishment. 95 you who 
believe, do not kill game while you are on pilgrimage.* And who- 
ever among you kills it intentionally, the compensation of it is the 
like of what he killed, from the cattle, as two just persons among 
you judge, as an offering to be brought to the Ka'bah, or the 
expiation of it is the feeding of the poor or equivalent of it in 
fasting, that he may taste the unwholesome result of his deed. 
Allah pardons what happened in the past. And whoever returns (to 
it), Allah will punish him. And Allah is Mighty, Lord of retri- 
bution. 96 Lawful to you is the game of the sea and its food, e a 
provision for you and for the travellers, and the game of the land 
is forbidden to you so long as you are on pilgrimage, and keep 
your duty to Allah, to Whom you shall be gathered. 



a (93) The verse speaks of those who died before the prohibition came. But 
even if it is taken generally, it would not justify doing what is unlawful, because 
one who believes, does good deeds, and keeps his duty will not approach any pro- 
hibited thing. In three times mentioning belief and regard for duty, the reference is 
to the threefold duty of man, viz., to Allah, to himself, and to others. 

b (95) The prohibition to kill game when on pilgrimage, mentioned in verses 
94-96, is a token of respect for the security of the Ka'bah (see v. 97), in addition 
to being a measure necessary for the safety of life in such a large gathering. 

c (96) By the game of the sea is meant all water game, whether sea, river, 
pond, or lake. The food of the sea is here distinguished from its game, and means 
what is found having been left by the sea or river on dry land, without needing to 
be caught.

that Allah is Knower of all things. 98 Know that Allah is Severe in 
retribution and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. "The duty of the 
Messenger is only to deliver the message. And Allah knows what

Section 14: Some Directions for Muslims 

101 O you who believe, do not ask about things which, if 
made known to you, would give you trouble; and if you ask about

to you. Allah pardons this; and Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing/

disbelievers in them. 



a (97-1) The word Ka 'bah comes from the root meaning it swelled or 
became prominent, and it is so called because of its prominence, or it is a pro- 
phetical name showing that it shall forever have eminence in the world. Al-Bait 
al-Haram (The Sacred or Inviolable House), used here, is also one of its names, 
and among the Arabs it was known as Bait Allah, or the House of Allah. 

b (97-2) This is a prophetic announcement that the Ka'bah will forever 
remain a support or stay for mankind, where pilgrims will flock from all parts of 
the world. The words "That is that you may know that Allah knows whatever is in 
the heavens and whatever is in the earth" indicate that the fulfilment of this pro- 
phecy in all future ages will be a sign of the great knowledge of Allah, Who 
pronounced it at a time when the Ka'bah was hardly known beyond the borders of 
Arabia; see 3:97. 

c (101) Islam prohibited questions relating to details on many points which 
would require this or that practice to be made obligatory, and much was left to 
individual will or the circumstances of the time and place. The exercise of judg- 
ment occupies a very important place in Islam and this gives ample scope to 
different nations and communities to frame laws for themselves to meet new and 
changed situations. The Holy Prophet also discouraged questions on details in 
which a Muslim could choose a way for himself.

who goes astray cannot harm you when you are on the right way. 
To Allah you will all return, so He will inform you of what you

106 O you who believe, call to witness between you, when 
death draws near to one of you, at the time of making the will, two 
just persons from among you, or two others from among others 
than you, if you are travelling in the land and the calamity of 
death befalls you. You should detain them after the prayer. Then if 
you doubt (them), they shall both swear by Allah (saying): We 
will not take for it a price even for a relative, nor will we hide the 
testimony of Allah, c for then certainly we shall be sinners. 107 If it 
is discovered that they are guilty of a sin, two others shall stand up 
in their place from among those against whom the first two have 
been guilty of a sin; so they shall swear by Allah: Certainly our 
testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have 
not exceeded the limit, for then surely we should be unjust. 
108 Thus it is more probable that they will give true testimony or 
fear that other oaths will be taken after their oaths. And keep your 
duty to Allah and listen. And Allah does not guide the trans- 
gressing people. 



a (103) The liberation of certain animals in honour of idols was a practice 
among the Arabs, and as Islam uprooted every vestige of idolatry, this practice is 
condemned here. The terms bahirah, sd'ibah, wasilah and hami referred to vari- 
ous types of camels and goat. 

b (106-1) The words "others than you" show that the evidence of the follow- 
ers of other religions is admissible according to the Quran, who may be chosen as 
witnesses by Muslims. 

c (106-2) "The testimony of Allah" stands for the testimony which Allah has 
enjoined to be borne uprightly.

We have no knowledge. Surely You are the great Knower of the

My favour to you and to your mother, when I strengthened you 
with the Holy Spirit; you spoke to people in the cradle and in old 
age, and when I taught you the Book and the Wisdom and the 
Torah and the Gospel, and when you determined out of clay a 
thing like the form of a bird by My permission, then you breathed 
into it and it became a bird by My permission; and you healed the

dead by My permission; and when I withheld the Children of 
Israel from you when you came to them with clear arguments —

a (114-1) The word 'id used here means a festival, the literal significance 
being an ever-recurring happiness or source of enjoyment. 

b (114-2) This passage seems to refer to the well-known prayer for daily 
bread, which Jesus appears to have included in the famous Lord's prayer on 
account of the earthly inclinations of his disciples. The food of the earth has no 
doubt been granted in abundance to Christians, but this has deprived them of the 
heavenly food. The Muslim's prayer in the opening chapter of the Quran craves 
not for bread but for the right path. The form of the prayer here, that it should be 
an ever-recurring happiness, shows clearly that the prayer was not for a table 
laden with provisions, as is generally supposed. As to its being sent down from 
heaven, it should be borne in mind that, in the language of the Quran, everything 
is with God and is sent down to people; see 15:21. 

c (115) The terrible calamities which the two World Wars brought to huma- 
nity, and especially to the Christian nations, are unprecedented in human history. 
The calamities which have befallen the world today are due to the mad race for 
bread and for the wealth of this world. The neglect of the higher values of life and 
running blindly after material comforts has already brought to the world a ruin 
which it has never witnessed before. 

rf(116) From this description of Mary being taken for a god by Christians, 
some critics of the Quran conclude that it has mistakenly considered the Trinity to 
consist of the three persons — God, Jesus and Mary. However, the doctrine of the 
Trinity is not mentioned here, while the divinity of Mary is not mentioned where 
the Quran speaks of the Trinity. See 4:171 footnote 3 and 5:73 footnote 1. As to 
Mary being taken for a god, the catechism of the Roman Church includes the 
following doctrines: "That she is truly the mother of God, and the second Eve, by 
whose means we have received blessing and life; that she is the mother of Pity 
and very specially our advocate; that her images are of the utmost utility"

what is in Your mind. Surely You are the great Knower of the 
unseen. 117 I said to them nothing but what You commanded me: 
Serve Allah, my Lord and your Lord; and I was a witness of them 
so long as I was among them, but when You caused me to die You 
were the Watcher over them. And You are Witness of all things." 
m If You punish them, surely they are Your servants; and if You 
protect them, surely You are the Mighty, the Wise. 119 Allah will 
say: This is a day when their truth will profit the truthful ones. For 
them are Gardens in which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. 
Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with 
Allah. That is the mighty achievement. 120 AUah's is the kingdom 
of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them; and He is 
Powerful over all things. 



a (117) This verse is a conclusive proof that Jesus died a natural death, and 
is not now alive in heaven. Here Jesus says that so long as he was among his 
followers he was a witness of their condition, and he did not find them holding the 
belief in his divinity. The logical conclusion of this statement is that the false 
doctrine of his divinity was introduced into the Christian faith after his death, 
after "You caused me to die"; see further 3:55 footnote 1. A saying of the Holy 
Prophet is recorded in which the Holy Prophet speaks concerning himself in the 
very words which are here put into the mouth of Jesus. He said that he would be 
shown on the day of Resurrection some of his followers who had gone against his 
teachings, and "I would say what the righteous servant said: I was a witness of 
them so long as I was among them, but when You caused me to die, You were the 
Watcher over them" (Bukhari, 60:8). 

b (118) The words tagkfir la-hum {protect them ox forgive them) refer to 
their final protection which will be granted to the Christian nations through accep- 
tance of Islam. If the forgiveness of sins was meant, the Divine attributes referred 
to would have been those speaking of forgiveness and mercy, as the Forgiving, 
the Merciful. Instead of that the attributes referred to are the Mighty, the Wise, 
which generally indicate that some great purpose would be achieved and a trans- 
formation would be brought about. 



Chapter 6 

Al-An'am Cattle 

The name of this chapter refers to certain superstitious and idolatrous practices 
of the pre-Islamic Arabs (v. 142-144) which were to be abolished to establish 
the doctrine of Divine Unity. The chapter deals with this doctrine at length, 
presents evidence to prove its truth and declares its ultimate triumph over 
idolatry and all other kinds of polytheism. This chapter was revealed at 
Makkah in the last year of the phase of the Holy Prophet's life there. 



Section 1 : Ultimate Triumph of Divine Unity 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, 
and made darkness and light. Yet those who disbelieve set up 
equals to their Lord." 2 He it is Who created you from clay, then 
He decreed a term. And there is a term named with Him; still you 
doubt.* 3 And He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth. He 
knows your secret (thoughts) and your open (words), and He knows 
what you earn.' 



a (1) The words that Allah is the Maker of darkness and light are directed 
against the dualistic doctrine of the Magian religion, which holds light and dark- 
ness to be two co-eternal principles. The religion of Islam is the purest mono- 
theism, and thus it holds that the ultimate cause of all things is the Great Maker of 
the heavens and the earth. Pure monotheism holds out before mankind the bright 
hope that, as goodness is inherent in the Divine Being, it is also the goal to which 
the creation moves on; while dualism considers the prevalence of evil to be 
necessary. 

b (2) The first term is that of life and the second the Resurrection. All 
humans are here said to be created from clay, which means, in the case of Adam 
as well as human beings generally, that the earth is the original source, and dust 
the first stage, of life. 

c (3) Life in Resurrection, spoken of in the previous verse, is here stated to 
be the result of man's own actions, which, whether done secretly or openly, are 
known to God. It is out of what you earn that He shapes a new life for you.

6 : 4 • ULTIMATE TRIUMPH OF DIVINE UNITY 1 65 

4 And no message comes to them of the messages of their 
Lord but they turn away from it. 5 So they rejected the truth when 
it came to them, but soon will come to them the news of what they 
mocked. 6 Do they not see how many a generation We destroyed 
before them, whom We had established in the earth as We have 
not established you, and We sent clouds pouring abundant rain on 
them, and We made rivers flow beneath them? Then We des- 
troyed them for their sins, and raised up after them another 
generation. 

7 And if We had sent down to you a writing on paper, then 
they had touched it with their hands, those who disbelieve would 
have said: This is nothing but clear enchantment." 8 And they say: 
Why has not an angel been sent down to him? And if We send 
down an angel, the matter would be decided and then they would 
not be given respite. 9 And if We had made him an angel, We 
would certainly have made him a man, and (thus) made confused 
to them what they confuse. c 10 And messengers before you were 
indeed mocked, but that which they derided befell those of them 
who scoffed/ 



a (7) If truth had been sent down to man in the physical form of a book, and 
had not been revealed to the mind of man, it could not bring about a transforma- 
tion in the minds of human beings. But even if it had taken a physical shape, they 
would have called it an enchantment, and still rejected it. 

b (8) They wanted to see the spiritual reality of the angel in a physical form. 
The presence of angels was felt by the righteous in the transformation which they 
worked in their hearts but the hearts of the wicked were impervious to all good, 
and hence the only form in which the angels could make their presence felt to 
them was by punishing them for their evil deeds. Hence the coming of the angels 
to the guilty is always spoken of in the Quran as being synonymous with the 
infliction of the punishment with which they were threatened. Compare 2:210 and 
v. 158 of this chapter. 

c (9) If an angel were made a messenger to mankind, he would doubtless 
appear in the form of a man as the physical eye cannot see angels. Thus there 
would still be the same confusion in their minds as when a human being was en- 
trusted with the Divine message. Moreover only a human being could serve as a 
model for people. 

d (10) They ridiculed the idea of the Prophet and the believers being trium- 
phant. Truth had always triumphed, they are told, and it would triumph even now.

Section 2: Greatness of Divine Mercy 

11 Say: Travel in the land, then see what was the end of the 
rejectors. 12 Say: To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and 
the earth? Say: To Allah. He has ordained mercy on Himself." He 
will certainly gather you on the day of Resurrection — there is no 
doubt about it. Those who have lost their souls, they will not 
believe. 13 And to Him belongs whatever dwells in the night and 
the day. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing. 

14 Say: Shall I take for a friend other than Allah, the Origina- 
tor of the heavens and the earth, and He feeds and is not fed? Say: 
I am commanded to be the first of those who submit. And do not 
be of those who set up partners (with Allah). 15 Say: Surely I fear, 
if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of a grievous day. 16 He from 
whom it is averted on that day, Allah indeed has had mercy on 
him. And this is a manifest achievement. 17 And if Allah touch you 
with affliction, there is none to remove it but He. And if He touch 
you with good, He is Powerful over all things. 18 And He is the 
Supreme, above His servants. And He is the Wise, the Aware. 

19 Say: What thing is of most weight in testimony? Say: Allah 
is witness between you and me. And this Quran has been revealed 
to me that with it I may warn you and whomsoever it reaches. c Do 
you really bear witness that there are other gods with Allah? Say: I 
do not bear witness. Say: He is only One God, and surely I am 
innocent of what you set up (with Him). 20 Those whom We have 
given the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons. Those 
who have lost their souls, they will not believe. 



a (12) The words He has ordained mercy on Himself 'imply that mercy is in 
fact His very nature. The evidence of Divine mercy is manifest in the physical 
world: He has created all things for the benefit of man. Would He not deal equally 
mercifully with man in his spiritual needs and send a revelation to guide him? 

b (17) The meaning is: Allah, being All-powerful, will bring good to you. 

c (19) The Holy Prophet was thus a warner, not for the Arabs only, but for 
all people whom the Quran may reach, i.e. for the whole world. 

d (20) For as they recognize their sons, see 2: 146 and footnote. 



6:21' POLYTHEISTS' WITNESS AGAINST THEMSELVES 167 

Section 3: Polytheists' Witness against themselves 

21 And who is more unjust than one who forges a lie about 
Allah, or calls His messages a lie? Surely the wrongdoers will not 
be successful. 22 And on the day We gather them all together, then 
We shall say to those who set up partners (with Allah): Where are 
your associate-gods whom you asserted? 23 Then their excuse 
would be nothing but that they would say: By Allah, our Lord! we 
did not set up partners. 24 See how they lie against their own souls, 
and what they forged shall fail them! 25 And some of them listen to 
you and We have cast veils over their hearts so that they do not 
understand it and a deafness into their ears. And (even) if they see 
every sign they will not believe in it. a So much so that when they 
come to you they only dispute with you — those who disbelieve 
say: This is nothing but stories of the ancients. 

26 And they forbid (others) from it, and they keep away from 
it; and they ruin none but their own souls while they do not per- 
ceive. 27 And if you could see when they are made to stand before 
the Fire, and say: If only we were sent back, we would not reject 
the messages of our Lord but would be from among the believers. 
28 No, what they concealed before will become manifest to them. 
And if they were sent back, they would certainly go back to what 
they are forbidden, and surely they are liars. 29 And they say: 
There is nothing but our life of this world and we shall not be 
raised again. 30 And if you could see when they are made to stand 
before their Lord! He will say: Is not this the truth? They will say: 
Certainly, by our Lord! He will say: Taste then the punishment 
because you disbelieved. 



a (25) Veils were cast over their hearts because they would not believe even 
if they saw all the signs. As the words that follow show, they came to the Prophet, 
not for the purpose of listening to and pondering over what he said, but to dispute 
with him. The veils were due to their own actions; see 2:10 and footnote. 

b (28) The evil consequences of their deeds were hidden in this life, but they 
will become manifest in the life after death. And since, if they were sent back, the 
evil consequences of evil deeds would again be hidden from the physical eye they 
would revert to evil deeds. 



168 6. CATTLE -6:31 

Section 4: Rejection of the Truth 

31 They are losers indeed who reject the meeting with Allah, 
until when the hour comes upon them suddenly," they will say: 
O our grief for our neglecting it! And they bear their burdens on 
their backs. Now surely evil is what they bear! 32 And this world's 
life is but an idle sport and play. And certainly the abode of the 
Hereafter is better for those who keep their duty. Do you not then 
understand? 33 We know indeed that what they say grieves you, for 
surely they do not call you a liar, but the wrongdoers deny the 
messages of Allah. 34 And messengers indeed were rejected before 
you, but they were patient when rejected and persecuted, until Our 
help came to them. And there is none to change the words of 
Allah. c And there has already come to you some information about 
the messengers. 35 And if their turning away is hard on you, then, if 
you can, seek an opening into the earth or a ladder to heaven, to 
bring them a sign!'' And if Allah pleased, He would certainly have 
gathered them all to guidance, so do not be from among the igno- 
rant. 36 0nly those accept who listen. And (as for) the dead, Allah 
will raise them, then to Him they will be returned. 6 



a (31) By the hour is meant their doom, as well as the hour of the final judg- 
ment. 

b (33) The Holy Prophet was known among them as al-Amln, i.e., the 
Faithful or the Truthful one. His worst enemies at the height of their enmity 
admitted that he had never told a lie. It was after he received the Divine revelation 
that he was called a liar, and hence it was really a denial of the Divine revelation, 
not a denial as to the Prophet's truthfulness. 

c (34) The context shows that by the words of Allah here are meant the 
prophecies foretelling the triumph of Truth and the overthrow of all opposition. 

d (35) By sign is meant a sign that should bring all to guidance. Their doom 
was pronounced, and that word must be fulfilled, as affirmed in the previous 
verse; but the demand of the people to be overawed into an immediate submission 
to the Prophet by a sign was not in accordance with the Divine Law. 

e (36) Those addressed by the Holy Prophet are here divided into two classes: 
(1) those who listen: they accept him and become believers; (2) those who are 
spiritually dead and pay no heed to his warning. Even the latter are not to be 
despaired of, for Allah will raise them too to spiritual life. Their being returned to 
Allah stands here for their ultimate acceptance of the Truth. 



6 : 37 • CONSEQUENCES OF REJECTION 169 

37 And they say: Why has not a sign been sent down to him 
from his Lord? Say: Surely Allah is Able to send down a sign, but 
most of them do not know." 38 And there is no animal in the earth, 
nor a bird that flies on its two wings, but (they are) communities 
like yourselves. We have not neglected anything in the Book. Then 
to their Lord will they be gathered. 39 And those who reject Our 
messages are deaf and dumb, in darkness. Whom Allah pleases He 
leaves in error. And whom He pleases He places on the right way. 
40 Say: See, if the punishment of Allah overtake you or the hour 
come upon you, will you call on others than Allah, if you are 
truthful? 41 No, Him you call upon, so He removes that for which 
you pray, if He pleases, and you forget what you set up as partners 
(with Him). 

Section 5: Consequences of Rejection 

42 And indeed We sent (messengers) to nations before you 
then We seized them with distress and affliction that they might 
humble themselves. 43 Yet why did they not, when Our punishment 
came to them, humble themselves? But their hearts hardened and 
the devil made all that they did seem good to them. 44 Then, when 
they neglected what they had been admonished with, We opened 
for them the gates of all things. c Until, when they rejoiced in what 
they were given, We seized them suddenly; then they were in 



a (37) Allah did send the very sign demanded, as we find the Arabs sub- 
mitting to the Holy Prophet almost in a body after the conquest of Makkah. 

b (38) Other creatures are all provided for by Allah as human beings are, so 
far as physical needs are concerned. But man's nature aspires to something higher, 
and it is to satisfy that spiritual craving that prophets are sent. This verse, more- 
over, points, as it were, to two classes of people — those who, like beasts, are 
wholly bent on earth and cannot rise, and those who rise like birds, soaring 
upward to the higher spiritual regions. The concluding words of the verse — then 
to their Lord will they be gathered — are in reference to mankind and, as com- 
pared with other animals, point to the Higher life, the life eternal in God. There is 
no mention here or anywhere else in the Quran of the lower animals being raised 
to a new life for Judgment. 

c (44) By opening the gates of all things is meant that all comforts of life 
were made accessible to them. 



170 6. CATTLE -6:45 

utter despair! 45 So the roots of the people who did wrong were cut 
off. And praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds." 

46 Say: Have you considered that if Allah should take away 
your hearing and your sight and seal your hearts, who is the god 
besides Allah that can bring it to you? See how We repeat the 
messages yet they turn away! 47 Say: See, if the punishment of 
Allah should overtake you suddenly or openly, will any be des- 
troyed but the wrongdoing people? 48 And We do not send 
messengers but as bearers of good news and warners; then whoever 
believes and acts aright, they shall have no fear, nor shall they 
grieve. 49 And as for those who reject Our messages, punishment 
will afflict them because they transgressed. 50 Say: I do not say to 
you, I have with me the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the 
unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel; I follow only what 
is revealed to me. Say: Are the blind and the seeing alike? Do you 
not then reflect? 

Section 6: Reward of Believers 

51 And warn with it those who fear that they will be gathered 
to their Lord — there is no protector for them, nor any intercessor 
besides Him — so that they may keep their duty. 52 And do not 
drive away those who call upon their Lord, morning and evening, 
desiring only His pleasure. Neither are you accountable for them 
at all, nor are they accountable for you at all, that you should drive 
them away and thus be one of the wrongdoers. c 53 And thus do We 



a (45) By cutting off the roots is meant the destruction of the ringleaders in 
particular. 

b (50) Appearing among a superstitious and ignorant people, the Holy 
Prophet could have claimed any supernatural powers for himself. But he told them 
plainly that he was a man who had no treasures, nor did he lay claim as a man to 
know the secrets of the future, nor did he profess to be any more than a mortal. 
Allah had revealed His will to him, and he faithfully followed and translated into 
practice everything that he received from on High. And as he himself was, so he 
wanted others to be. The unique greatness of the Prophet lies in the fact that he 
never tried to put himself before people as superhuman. 

c (52) This verse was revealed when some leading Quraish expressed their 



6:54' DIVINE JUDGMENT 171 

try some of them by others so that they say: Are these they upon 
whom Allah has conferred benefit from among us? " Does not 
Allah best know the grateful? 54 And when those who believe in 
Our messages come to you, say: Peace be on you, your Lord has 
ordained mercy on Himself, (so) that if anyone of you does evil in 
ignorance, then turns after that and acts aright, then He is For- 
giving, Merciful. 55 And thus do We make distinct the messages so 
that the way of the guilty may become clear. 

Section 7: Divine Judgment 

56 Say: I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon 
besides Allah. Say: I do not follow your low desires, for then 
indeed I should go astray and should not be of the guided ones. 
57 Say: Surely I have manifest proof from my Lord and you call it a 
lie. I do not have with me (the power to bring) what you seek to 
hasten. The judgment is only Allah's. He relates the truth and He 
is the Best of deciders. 58 Say: If I had with me (the power to 
bring) what you seek to hasten, the matter would have certainly 
been decided between you and me. And Allah best knows the 
wrongdoers. 

59 And with Him are the treasures of the unseen — none 
knows them but He. And He knows what is in the land and the 
sea. And no leaf falls but He knows it, nor is there a grain in the 
darkness of the earth, nor anything green or dry, but (it is all) in a 
clear book. 60 And He it is Who takes your souls at night, and He 

willingness to accept the Prophet if the poorer Muslims were not allowed to 
remain in his company at the time. The poor and the rich are here brought to the 
same level; they have equal claims to learn and practise the truth. Truth is equally 
accessible to all. To the religion of Islam, no aristocracy is known. Before the 
Great Master the differences of rank, wealth and colour sink into insignificance, 
and therefore before Allah's Messenger, as before Allah Himself, they must all 
stand upon one level. Everyone is answerable for what he does is the golden prin- 
ciple preached by Islam. 

a (53) The simple and decisive answer given above no doubt wounded the 
pride of the wealthy Quraish, who were required to sit along with the poor slaves 
whom they never treated as human beings, and thus they were tried. 

b (59) The clear book is the great law of cause and effect. The falling of the

knows what you earn by day, then He raises you up in it that an 
appointed term may be fulfilled. Then to Him is your return, then 
He will inform you of what you did. 

Section 8: Divine Judgment 

61 And He is the Supreme above His servants, and He sends 
keepers over you; until when death comes to one of you, Our 
messengers cause him to die, and they are not remiss. 62 Then are 
they sent back to Allah, their Master, the True one. Now surely 
His is the judgment and He is swiftest in taking account. 

63 Say: Who is it that delivers you from the calamities of the 
land and the sea? (When) you call upon Him, in humility and in 
secret: If He deliver us from this, we will certainly be of the 
grateful ones. 64 Say: Allah delivers you from this and from every 
distress, yet you set up partners (with Him). 65 Say: He has the 
power to send on you a punishment from above you or from 
beneath your feet, or to throw you into confusion, (making you) of 
different factions, and make some of you taste the violence of 
others. See how We repeat the messages that they may under- 
stand!" 



leaf indicates that its power to draw nourishment has come to an end; thus do 
individuals and nations fall. The grain in the darkness of the earth stands for the 
mission of the Prophet, for that grain was destined to sprout forth, growing into a 
tree of exceptional proportions. The "green" indicates those people that prosper 
and the "dry" those that must fall off. 

a (65) The three forms of punishment were witnessed by the Holy Prophet's 
opponents later on. A punishment from above took the form of a storm during the 
well-known battle of the Allies, when an army between ten and twenty thousand 
strong took to flight on account of a great storm; a punishment from beneath took 
the form of a drought which brought great affliction upon the people of Makkah 
for seven years; while they were made to taste the violence at the hands of the 
Muslims in the battles which they themselves started and which brought about the 
final disruption of the power of the Quraish. Applied to the modern West, the 
punishment from above and punishment from below are, respectively, the tyranny 
of the bourgeois and the tyranny of the proletariate. The capitalists first tyrannized 
labour and then communism wreaked vengeance on the capitalists. To these two 
punishments is now added a third. The whole world is divided into parties which 
aim at each other's destruction and the violence of man against man has reached a

66 And your people call it a lie and it is the Truth. Say: I am 
not put in charge of you. 67 For every prophecy is a term, and you 
will soon come to know (it). a 68 And when you see those who talk 
nonsense about Our messages, withdraw from them until they 
enter into some other discourse. And if the devil cause you to 
forget, then do not sit after recollection with the unjust people. 
69 And those who keep their duty are not accountable for them at 
all but (theirs) is only to remind; perhaps they may guard against 
evil. 

70 And leave those who take their religion for a play and an 
idle sport, and whom this world's life has deceived, and remind 
(people) with this (message) in case a soul be destroyed for what it 
has earned. It has besides Allah no friend nor intercessor, and 
though it offer every compensation, it will not be accepted from it. 
Those are they who are destroyed for what they earn. For them is 
a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment, because they 
disbelieved. 

Section 9: Abraham's Argument for Divine Unity 

71 Say: Shall we call, besides Allah, on that which does not 
benefit us nor harm us, and shall we be turned back on our heels 
after Allah has guided us? Like one whom the devils cause to 
follow his low desires, in bewilderment in the earth — he has 
companions who call him to the right way (saying), Come to us. 
Say: Surely the guidance of Allah, that is the (true) guidance. And 
we are commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds, 72 and that 
you should keep up prayer and keep your duty to Him. And He it 
is to Whom you shall be gathered. 73 And He it is Who created the 



peak unthought of by the world. Whole cities with their millions of residents are 
turned into graves in the twinkling of an eye, and this wholesale destruction of 
man by man is considered as the greatest feat of material civilization. 

a (67) The prophecy of the vanquishment of the powerful opponents of 
Islam is declared with even greater emphasis than in the earlier stage of the Pro- 
phet's mission, despite the apparent triumph of opposition to his cause which had 
succeeded in scattering the few people who accepted Islam.

heavens and the earth with truth. And when He says, Be, it is. fl His 
word is the truth and His is the kingdom on the day when the 
trumpet is blown.* The Knower of the unseen and the seen; and 
He is the Wise, the Aware. 

74 And when Abraham said to his sire, Azar: c Do you take 
idols for gods? Surely I see you and jour people in manifest error. 
75 And thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens 
and the earth and that he might have certainty. d 76 So when the 
night overshadowed him, he saw a star. He said: Is this my Lord? e 
So when it set, he said: I do not love the setting ones. 77 Then when 
he saw the moon rising, he said: Is this my Lord? So when it set, 



a (73-1) These words are generally used when the bringing about of a great 
change — a change which seems to be impossible to people — is meant. 

b (73-2) The reference may be either to the Resurrection when human beings 
will be raised to be brought to judgment, or the great spiritual resurrection which 
was to be brought about through the Holy Prophet when the whole of Arabia was 
destined to receive a new life, the life spiritual, or perhaps to the still greater spiri- 
tual resurrection when the whole of humanity was destined to receive a new life 
through the triumph of Islam. 

c (74) Whether Azar was the father of Abraham, or his grandfather or uncle, 
is a much disputed point. The word ab means a father as well as an ancestor, and 
in 2:133 it is applied to an uncle because there Ishmael is spoken of as an ab of 
Jacob. Abraham's father (walid) is indicated in 14:41 to be a believer, while the 
sire (ab) is elsewhere mentioned as having stuck to idolatry till his death (9:114). 
Hence I prefer sire as the significance of the word. 

d (75) Showing Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth signifies 
granting him an insight into the Divine laws of nature working in the kingdom of 
the heavens and the earth. This insight had convinced him that Allah was the real 
controller of the universe, while the sun, the moon, the stars and other heavenly 
bodies, were only His creation and subject to His laws. 

e (76) These words, which literally mean this is my Lord, do not contain 
Abraham's conviction. The words are either uttered by way of surprise or, as trans- 
lated here, the phrase may be interrogatory, expressing disapproval. It should be 
borne in mind that Abraham never worshipped idols or the heavenly bodies like 
his people. He has already been spoken of in v. 74 as denouncing the idol-worship 
of his people, and in v. 75 as possessing certainty of faith in One God. Further on, 
we find it clearly stated in v. 83 that what is related here was an argument by 
which Abraham tried to convince his people that they worshipped false deities, 
which were themselves subject to Divine laws. 



6:78' ABRAHAM'S ARGUMENT FOR DIVINE UNITY 1 75 

he said: If my Lord had not guided me, I should certainly be of the 
people who are in error. 78 Then when he saw the sun rising, he 
said: Is this my Lord? Is this the greatest? So when it set, he said: 
My people, I am clear of what you set up (with Allah). 79 Surely I 
have turned myself, being upright, wholly to Him Who originated 
the heavens and the earth, and I am not of those who set up partners 
(with Allah). 

80 And his people disputed with him. He said: Do you dispute 
with me respecting Allah and He has guided me indeed? And I do 
not fear in any way those that you set up with Him, unless my 
Lord please. My Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. 
Will you not then be mindful? 81 And how should I fear what you 
have set up (with Him), while you do not fear to set up partners 
with Allah for which He has sent down to you no authority? 
Which then of the two parties is surer of security, if you know? 
82 Those who believe and do not mix up their faith with wrong- 
doing — for them is security and they go aright. 

Section 10: Prophets among Abraham's Descendants 

83 And this was Our argument which We gave to Abraham 
against his people. We exalt in degrees whom We please. Surely 
your Lord is Wise, Knowing. 84 And We gave him Isaac and Jacob. 
Each did We guide; and Noah did We guide before, and of his 
descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses 
and Aaron. And thus do We reward those who do good (to others), 
85 and Zacharias and John and Jesus and Elias; each one (of them) 
was of the righteous, 86 and Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot; 
and each one (of them) We made to excel the people; 87 and some 
of their fathers and their descendants and their brethren. And We 
chose them and guided them to the right way. 

88 This is Allah's guidance with which He guides whom He 
pleases of His servants. And if they had set up partners (with Him), 
all that they did would have been fruitless. 89 These are they to 



176 6. CATTLE -6:90 

whom We gave the Book and authority and prophecy. " Therefore 
if these disbelieve in it, We have indeed entrusted it to a people 
who are not disbelievers in it. 90 These are they whom Allah guided, 
so follow their guidance. Say: I do not ask you for any reward for 
it. It is nothing but a Reminder for the nations. 

Section 1 1 : Truth of Divine Revelation 

91 And they do not honour Allah with the honour due to Him, 
when they say: Allah has not revealed anything to a mortal. c Say: 
Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and a gui- 
dance to people — you make it into (scattered) papers, which you 



a (89) Each one of the prophets was given three things. The first was the 
Kitdb, the Book, or the Divine revelation which the prophet was granted to guide 
people aright. The second is called hukm, which means authority to judge. This 
shows that every prophet received authority directly from God, and it was by 
Divine authority that he judged his people. The third is nubuwwat, which means 
prophethood or the gift of prophecy. The Book contains directions for guidance of 
the people and nubuwwat is the prophetical part which is meant to strengthen faith. 
Thus the Holy Prophet Muhammad was granted the gift of prophecy long before 
he was granted the Book which began with the words, Read in the name of your 
Lord (96: 1). Further there is a vast number of his prophecies which are contained 
in the Hadith and which do not form a part of the Book, the Quran. 

b (90) The Prophet is told to follow the guidance of all the earlier prophets 
because his message was for all the nations to whom previous prophets had sepa- 
rately come. Hence the Quran is called a Reminder, showing that it was meant for 
all the nations, to whom it was a reminder of what they had received before. The 
Prophet is, in fact, here told that he was now the representative of all the prophets 
that had gone before him, and therefore possessed all the excellences which were 
granted to those prophets separately. 

c (91-1) The words Allah has not revealed anything to a mortal may mean a 
total denial of God revealing Himself to man or simply a denial of revelation to 
the Holy Prophet. The Jews and the Christians are told in this verse that the same 
God Who revealed a book to Moses, containing a clear prophecy of a prophet like 
him, has now in fulfilment of that prophecy sent the like of Moses. Their only 
answer to that clear prophecy was that they would not mention it or talk of it at all 
— and you conceal much. The deniers of Divine revelation are also told, more 
generally, that the proof of revelation was in the knowledge which it gave — you 
are taught what neither you nor your fathers knew. 

rf(91-2) The book was not kept intact, hence its description as scattered 
papers.

show and you conceal much? And you are taught what neither you 
nor your fathers knew. Say: Allah. Then leave them sporting in 
their idle talk. 92 And this is a Blessed Book We have revealed, 
verifying what is (already) before it, and that you may warn the 
mother-town " and those around it. And those who believe in the 
Hereafter believe in it, and they keep a guard over their prayers. 

93 And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against 
Allah, or says, Revelation has been granted to me, while nothing 
has been revealed to him; and he who says: I can reveal the like of 
what Allah has revealed? ' And if you could see when the wrong- 
doers are in the agonies of death and the angels stretch forth their 
hands, (saying): Yield up your souls. This day you are awarded a 
punishment of disgrace because you spoke against Allah other 
than truth, and (because) you scorned His messages. 94 And cer- 
tainly you have come to Us one by one as We created you at first, 
and you have left behind your backs what We gave you. And We 
do not see with you your intercessors about whom you asserted 
that they were (Allah's) partners in respect to you. Certainly the 
ties between you are now cut off and what you asserted has failed 
you. 

Section 12: Ultimate Triumph of the Truth 

95 Surely Allah causes the grain and the date-stone to germi- 
nate. He brings forth the living from the dead and He is the bringer 
forth of the dead from the living. That is Allah. How are you then 
turned away (from truth)! e 96 He is the cleaver of the daybreak; 



a (92) Umm al-Qura or the mother of the towns is the title by which Makkah 
is known. The reason is not only that it was both the political and the spiritual 
centre of Arabia, but also because it was destined to be the universal spiritual 
centre — the real mother of the whole world. 

b (93) These words declare the Holy Prophet free of having forged a lie 
against Allah. The claim "I can reveal the like of what Allah has revealed" are the 
words of those who refuse to believe in the truth of Divine revelation. 

c (95) The preaching of the Holy Prophet is likened to the sowing of the seed 
which, though to all appearance it is lost in the earth, soon springs forth into a 
large tree. The bringing forth the living from the dead is the bringing forth a living

follow the right way by them in the darkness of the land and the

single soul, then there is (for you) an abode and a repository/

from it green (foliage), from which We produce clustered grain; 
and of the date-palm, of the sheaths of it, come forth clusters (of 
dates) within reach; and gardens of grapes and the olive and the 
pomegranate, alike and unlike. Look at the fruit of it when it bears 
fruit and the ripening of it. Surely there are signs in this for a 
people who believe! i°°And they regard the jinn to be partners with 
Allah, and He created them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons 
and daughters without knowledge. Glory be to Him, and supreme- 
ly exalted is He above what they ascribe (to Him)! 



people from the spiritually dead Arabs, and the bringing forth the dead from the 
living alludes to the spiritual death of those who had been previously granted spiri- 
tual life through Divine revelation. 

a (96) The darkness prevailing in the earth would soon be dispelled, and 
would give place to light, even as, with the break of the morning, darkness gives 
place to light. 

b (97) The Holy Prophet is likened to the sun, and those who receive light 
from him and transmit it to others are likened to the stars. The analogy is that He 
Who makes light to guide you physically could not have neglected your spiritual 
guidance. 

c (98) The abode may indicate this life and the repository the grave. 

d (100) The reference is either to the dualistic doctrine of the Magi, who 
thought that while Allah was the creator of good, the devil was the creator of evil, 
or to the Arab belief that the jinn had a hand in the transaction of their affairs, or 
in bringing them good fortune or ill luck. 



6:101' GRADUAL PROGRESS 179 

Section 13: Gradual Progress 

101 Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth! How 
could He have a son when He has no consort? And He created 
everything, and He is the Knower of all things." 102 That is Allah, 
your Lord. There is no god but He, the Creator of all things; there- 
fore serve Him, and He has charge of all things. 103 Vision cannot 
comprehend Him, and He comprehends (all) vision; and He is the 
Knower of subtleties, the Aware. 

104 Clear proofs have indeed come to you from your Lord; so 
whoever sees, it is for the good of his own soul; and whoever is 
blind, it is to its harm. And I am not a keeper over you. 105 And 
thus do We repeat the messages, and that they may say, 7ou have 
studied; and that We may make it clear to a people who know. 
106 Follow what is revealed to you from jour Lord — there is no 
god but He; and turn away from those who set up partners (with 
Allah). 107 And if Allah had pleased, they would not have set up 
others (with Him). And We have not appointed you a keeper over 
them, and you are not in charge of them. 

108 And do not abuse those whom they call upon besides 
Allah, in case, exceeding the limits, they abuse Allah through 
ignorance. c Thus to every people have We made their deeds seem 
good; then to their Lord is their return so He will inform them of 
what they did. 109 And they swear their strongest oaths by Allah 
that if a sign comes to them they would certainly believe in it. 
Say: Signs are with Allah. And what should make you know that 
when they come they do not believe? 110 And We turn their hearts 



a (101) This verse and those that follow describe the transcendental Unity of 
the Divine Being. To attribute a son to Him is to acknowledge that He had a con- 
sort; otherwise the word son will have to be taken simply as a metaphor. 

b (103) The physical vision of man, working as it does only within narrow 
limits and being able only to see bodies, cannot comprehend the Infinite One. He 
is the all-pervading Spirit, and can be seen only with the spiritual eye. 

c (108) Here Muslims are forbidden to abuse even the idols of other people, 
though their worship is condemned in the strongest terms. 

rf(109) Many signs of the Holy Prophet's truth had appeared while he was

and their sights, just as they did not believe in it the first time; and 
We leave them in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on." 

Section 14: Idolaters' Opposition 

111 And even if We send down to them the angels and the 
dead speak to them and We bring together all things before them, 
they would not believe unless Allah please, but most of them are 
ignorant. 112 And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy, 
the devils from among the people and the jinn, some of them 
inspiring others with gilded speech to deceive (them)^ And if your 
Lord pleased, they would not do it, so leave them alone with what 
they forge — 113 And that the hearts of those who do not believe in 
the Hereafter may incline to it, and that they may be pleased with 
it, and that they may earn what they are earning. 

114 Shall I then seek a judge other than Allah, when He it is 
Who has sent down to you the Book fully explained. And those 

still at Makkah, but they still went on demanding signs. The reply, "signs are with 
Allah", means that the sign which they demanded would be shown and that Allah 
had the power to show all kinds of signs. But even then they would not believe. 
The first sign of the overthrow of the power of the Quraish appeared in the battle 
of Badr, but they did not believe even then. 

a (110) The turning of their hearts and sights is Allah 's leaving them in their 
inordinacy, as explained by the verse itself. And even this is due to their own 
action in rejecting the truth. When an attitude of enmity is assumed towards the 
truth, the heart becomes estranged from it, and this growing estrangement is term- 
ed the turning away of the heart from it. 

b (111) There are always some people who turn a deaf ear to every argu- 
ment, and it is of such leaders of evil that this verse speaks; see next verse. The 
coming of the angels stands for the execution of the decree of their punishment. 
The speaking of the dead refers either to the raising of the spiritually dead to life 
(see v. 122), or to the evidence of those who had passed away before the Prophet, 
being given through their writings. And lastly, by the bringing together of all 
things is meant the bringing together of things relating to their punishment. The 
meaning is that some of the opponents are so blind that the clearest of signs or 
proofs would not convince them. 

c (112) By the people and the jinn here are apparently meant the ordinary 
people and the leaders, suggesting to each other varnished tales of falsehood. See 
later v. 128 footnote 1 for a fuller discussion of the word /mo.

whom We have given the Book know that it is revealed by your 
Lord with truth, so do not be one of the disputers. 115 And the word 
of jour Lord has been accomplished truly and justly. There is 
none who can change His words; and He is the Hearer, the 
Knower." 116 And if you obey most of those in the earth, they will 
lead you astray from Allah's way. They follow nothing but con- 
jecture, and they only lie. 117 Surely jour Lord — He knows best 
who goes astray from His way, and He knows best the guided 
ones. 

118 Eat, then, of that on which Allah's name has been men- 
tioned, if you are believers in His messages. 119 And what reason 
have you that you should not eat of that on which Allah's name is 
mentioned, when He has already made plain to you what He has 
forbidden to you — except what you are compelled to. c And 
surely many lead (people) astray by their low desires through 
ignorance. Surely jour Lord — He best knows the transgressors. 
120 And avoid open sins and secret ones. Surely they who earn sin 
will be rewarded for what they have earned. 121 And do not eat of 
that on which Allah's name has not been mentioned, and that is 
surely a transgression. 2 And certainly the devils inspire their friends 



a (115) The word signifies the prophetic word; see 6:34 footnote. 

b (118) The establishment of the doctrine of Divine Unity, which is the object 
of this chapter, required the abolition of all idolatrous practices, among which was 
the practice of slaughtering animals in the names of idols. It is allowed to Mus- 
lims to slaughter animals for food, but Allah's name must be mentioned when the 
animal is slaughtered. This is also a reminder to man that this act of the taking of 
a life, even though it is the life of an animal, is made lawful only by Divine per- 
mission, for the attainment of a necessary purpose. 

c (119) The reference in these words is to what is said in an earlier revela- 
tion; see 16:115. The same subject is again referred to in 6:145, as also in 2:173 
and in greater detail in 5:3, both of these being revelations at Madinah. 

d (120) The Muslim is here commanded to consider open and secret sins to 
be equally hateful. In fact there are very few people who commit open sins as 
compared with those who are guilty of secret sins. 

e (121) These words are explained by the majority as containing only a pro- 
hibition against the eating of that which is slaughtered in the name of others than 
Allah.

to contend with you; and if you obey them, you will surely be 
those who set up partners (with Allah). 

Section 15: The Chief Opponents 

122 Is he who was dead, then We raised him to life and made 
for him a light by which he walks among the people, like him 
whose likeness is that of one in darkness from which he cannot 
come forth? a Thus their doings are made to seem good to the dis- 
believers. 123 And thus have We made in every town the leaders of 
its guilty ones, that they may make plans in it. And they plan only 
against themselves, and they do not perceive. 124 And when a message 
comes to them they say: We will not believe till we are given the 
like of what Allah's messengers are given. Allah best knows where 
to place His message. Humiliation from Allah and severe punish- 
ment will surely befall the guilty for their planning. 

125 So whomsoever Allah intends to guide, He expands his 
breast for Islam, and whomsoever He intends to leave in error, He 
makes his breast close (and) narrow as though he were ascending 
upwards. Thus does Allah lay uncleanness on those who do not 
believe. 126 And this is the path of jour Lord, (a) straight (path). 
Indeed We have made the messages clear for a people who are 
mindful. 127 Theirs is the abode of peace with their Lord, and He is 
their Friend because of what they do. 

128 And on the day when He will gather them all together: 
O assembly of jinn, e you took away a great part of the people. And 



a (122) These words explain what is meant by the raising of the dead to life 
through the prophets. Through the Quran the dead were raised to life and given a 
light by which they showed the way to others. The concluding words of the verse 
show that, despite witnessing this great transformation, the leaders of mischief went 
on opposing the Truth as if it were a good deed. 

b (125) The concluding words of the verse show that uncleanness of the 
heart, which makes a person's breast close and narrow, as though he were ascen- 
ding upwards, is the result of a man's own disbelief and rejection of the truth. 

c (128-1) The word jinn is derived from janna, meaning he covered or 
concealed or hid ox protected. The class of beings that goes under this name stands 
in the Quran for the spirits of evil or the beings that invite man to evil, as opposed

their friends from among the people will say: Our Lord, some of 
us profited by others and we have reached our appointed term 
which You appointed for us. He will say: The Fire is your abode 
— you shall abide in it, except as Allah please." Surely your Lord 
is Wise, Knowing. 129 And thus do We make some of the wrong- 
doers to befriend others on account of what they earn. 

Section 16: Evils of Idolatry 

130 O community of jinn and people, did not messengers come 
to you from among you, relating to you My messages and warning 
you of the meeting of this day of yours? They will say: We bear 
witness against ourselves. And this world's life deceived them, 
and they will bear witness against themselves that they were 
disbelievers. 131 This is because your Lord would not destroy towns 
unjustly while their people are negligent. c 132 And for all are 
degrees according to their doings. And your Lord is not heedless 
of what they do. 133 And your Lord is the Self-sufficient One, the 
Lord of mercy. If He please, He may remove you, and make whom 



to the angels, who invite him to good, both being alike invisible to the human eye. 
But there is a wider use of the word in Arabic literature as well as in the Quran. 
One signification of the word is explained under 72:1. But the word is also 
applied in the Quran to powerful leaders who, through their importance and 
detachment from the masses, do not mix freely with them, so they remain distant 
or "hidden from their eyes". Verses 129-131 show that by the jinn here are meant 
the human leaders of evil. 

a (128-2) The words except as Allah please indicate that those in hell shall 
after all be delivered from it. 

b (130) By calling the jinn and people a single community, the Quran has 
made it clear that the jinn and the people spoken of here are not two different 
classes of beings. Again, the jinn and the people are told that messengers had 
come to them from among them, i.e. from among jinn and people. But as the only 
messengers spoken of in the Quran and other reliable histories of prophets are 
those who belong to mankind, it follows that the jinn spoken of here belong to 
mankind, and not to any other class of creation. 

c (131) That is, while the reminder and the warning had not yet come to 
them. Or, the words mean that it is not for negligence that nations are destroyed; it 
is only when they become wrongdoers and spread mischief in the world that they 
are overtaken by punishment in this life. 



184 6. CATTLE -6:134 

He pleases successors after you, just as He raised you up from the 
offspring of other people. 134 Surely what you are promised will 
come to pass, and you cannot escape (it). i 3s Say: My people, act 
according to your ability, I too am acting; so you will soon come 
to know for whom is the (good) end of the abode. Surely the 
wrongdoers will not succeed. 

136 And they set apart a portion for Allah out of what He has 
created of crops and cattle, and say: This is for Allah — so they 
assert — and this for our associate-gods. Then that which is for 
their associate-gods does not reach Allah, and that which is for 
Allah reaches their associate-gods. Evil is what they judge. " 
137 And thus their associate-gods have made it seem good to many 
idolaters the killing of their children, that they may cause them to 
perish and obscure for them their religion. And if Allah had 
pleased, they would not have done it, so leave them alone with 
what they forge. 

138 And they say: Such and such cattle and crops are prohi- 
bited — none shall eat them except such as we please — so they 
assert — and cattle whose backs are forbidden, and cattle on 
which they would not mention Allah's name c — forging a lie 
against Him. He will recompense them for what they forge. 
i 39 And they say: What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is 
reserved for our males, and forbidden to our wives, and if it be 



a (136) It was a custom among the Arab idolaters to set apart certain portions 
of the produce of their fields and their cattle, one portion for Allah and another 
portion for the idols. The portion for idols was always applied to their use, but the 
portion set apart for Allah, though ordinarily spent to feed the poor and the needy, 
was in certain cases diverted to the use of the idols. The portion for the idols was 
handed over to the priests. 

b (137) This refers to the practice of killing or burying alive the female 
children, and also to the human sacrifices to idols, as they sometimes vowed that, 
if they had a number of sons, they would sacrifice one of them to an idol. By 
introducing these superstitious and evil customs they were making confused and 
obscure the true religion — the religion of the service of One God. 

c (138) That is, such as were sacrificed in the name of idols. All these along 
with what is said in the next two verses are denounced as being idolatrous prac- 
tices.

stillborn, they are partners in it. He will reward them for their (false) 
attribution. Surely He is Wise, Knowing. 140 They are losers indeed 
who kill their children foolishly without knowledge, and forbid 
what Allah has provided for them, forging a lie against Allah. They 
indeed go astray, and are not guided. 

Section 17: Idolaters' Self-imposed Prohibitions 

141 And He it is Who produces gardens, trellised and 
untrellised, and palms and seed-produce of which the fruits are of 
various sorts, and olives and pomegranates like and unlike. Eat of 
its fruit when it bears fruit, and pay the due of it on the day of its 
reaping, and do not be extravagant. Surely He does not love the 
extravagant; 142 and of the cattle (He has created) some for burden 
and some for slaughter. Eat of what Allah has given you and do 
not follow the footsteps of the devil. Surely he is your open enemy 

— 143 eight in pairs — of the sheep two and of the goats two. Say: 
Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or what the 
wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge, if 
you are truthful;" 144 and of the camels two and of the cows two. 
Say: Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or what 
the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses 
when Allah enjoined you this? Who is then more unjust than he 
who forges a lie against Allah to lead people astray without know- 
ledge? Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. 

Section 18: Prohibited Foods 

145 Say: I do not find in what is revealed to me anything 
forbidden for an eater to eat of, except if it is what dies of itself, or 
blood poured forth, or flesh of swine — for that surely is unclean 

— or what is a transgression, other than the name of Allah having 
been invoked on it. But whoever is driven by necessity, not desiring 



a (143) The Arabs considered those animals which were otherwise lawful 
for them to be unlawful in particular cases. These practices, which were all super- 
stitious, resulting from idol-worship, are here condemned. 

b (145) The reason for the prohibition of what dies of itself and blood and

nor exceeding the limit, then surely jour Lord is Forgiving, 
Merciful. 146 And to those who are Jews We forbade every animal 
having claws, and We forbade them the fat of oxen and sheep, 
except such as was on their backs or the entrails or what was 
mixed with bones. This was a punishment We gave them on 
account of their rebellion, and We are surely Truthful. 147 But if 
they reject you, then say: Your Lord is the Lord of all-encompass- 
ing mercy; and His punishment cannot be averted from the guilty 
people. 

148 Those who set up partners (with Allah) say: If Allah 
pleased we would not have set up partners (with Him) nor our 
fathers, nor would we have made anything unlawful. Thus did 
those before them reject (the truth) until they tasted Our punish- 
ment. Say: Have you any knowledge so you would bring it forth 
to us? You only follow a conjecture and you only tell lies. 149 Say: 
Then Allah's is the conclusive argument; so if He had pleased, He 
would have guided you all. i 50 Say: Bring your witnesses who 
bear witness that Allah forbade this. If they bear witness, then do 
not bear witness with them. And do not follow the low desires of 



swine's flesh is that these things are physically unclean, while the reason for the 
prohibition of animals on which other than Allah's name is invoked is that all 
things are to be avoided which are in any way associated with idolatry. 

a (147) The all-encompassing mercy of Allah is mentioned even in speaking 
of those who rejected the Holy Prophet. It was because of the mercy of Allah that 
the disbelievers were not destroyed immediately; but as punishing the "guilty" is 
in itself a mercy towards the weak and the oppressed, they are warned that they 
will not escape punishment if they persist in their evil ways. 

b (149) The previous verse records the statement of the disbelievers: "If 
Allah pleased we would not have set up partners with Him". The reply is that 
Allah reveals His will through His chosen messengers, so bring forth any Divine 
revelation that you possess sanctioning idolatry. The argument is here carried on 
further. Allah does not mislead people, but, in fact, He sends His prophets to 
guide them into the right path. His pleasure is therefore that everyone should walk 
in the right path and serve only one Master. That is the conclusive argument against 
the false assertion of the idolaters. The guidance of Allah is, moreover, brought 
through prophets, and people are never compelled to accept the right way; much 
less could they be compelled to follow the wrong course. Man was created with a 
will free within certain limits to act as he pleases.

Allah's covenant. This He enjoins on you that you may be mind- 
ful; 153 and (know) that this is My path, the right one, so follow it, 
and do not follow (other) ways, for they will lead you away from 
His way. This He enjoins on you that you may keep your duty. 
154 Again, We gave the Book to Moses to complete (Our blessings)

with their Lord. 

Section 20: The Goal for the Faithful 

155 And this is a Book We have revealed, full of blessings; so 
follow it and keep your duty that mercy may be shown to you, 
156 in case you say that the Book was revealed only to two parties 



a (152-1) That is, unless you do it with the object of improving it or making 
it profitable. Wages of the guardian may be paid from it, for which see 4:6. 

b (152-2) Islam requires a person to be so upright as not to be led away by 
the ties of relationship. Truth is not to be sacrificed to any interest but every interest 
must be sacrificed to truth. 

c (154) By all things are meant all those things needed for the guidance of 
the Israelites.

before us and we were truly unaware of what they read," 157 or, you 
say: If the Book had been revealed to us, we would have been 
better guided than they. So indeed clear proof has come to you 
from your Lord, and guidance and mercy. Who is then more 
unjust than he who rejects Allah's messages and turns away from 
them? We reward those who turn away from Our messages with 
an evil punishment because they turned away. 

158 They only wait that the angels should come to them, or 
that your Lord should come,' or that some of the signs of your 
Lord should come. On the day when some of the signs of your 
Lord come, its faith will not benefit a soul which did not believe 
before, nor earned good through its faith.^ Say: Wait; we too are 
waiting. 159 As for those who split up their religion and became 
sects, you have no concern with them. Their affair is only with 
Allah, then He will inform them of what they did. 160 Whoever 
brings a good deed will have tenfold like it, and whoever brings 
an evil deed, will be recompensed only with the like of it, and they 
shall not be wronged. 



a (156) As in Arabia there lived only the Jews and the Christians besides the 
idolaters, the Arabs spoke of only two parties to whom the Book was given. 

b (158-1) For a similar expression see 2:210. Also v. Ill and note. Similar 
words occur also in 16:33: "They only wait that the angels should come to them 
or that your Lord's command should come to pass". Here the words are that your 
Lord should come. Thus the coming of the Lord carries the same significance as 
the coming to pass of His command, or the execution of His decree, i.e. the final 
doom of the opponents. The coming of the angels stands for the smaller visita- 
tions or distresses the opponents witnessed in the battles which they fought to 
annihilate Islam, in which the coming of angels is spoken of; see 3:125-126, 8:9. 

c (158-2) The only time when faith does not benefit a soul is the approach of 
death, and hence I am of opinion that by "some of the signs of your Lord" are 
meant clear signs of approach of death. A person's death is in one sense also his 
resurrection: "Whoever dies, his resurrection comes to pass" (Mishkat, 26:6). 

d (160) No other sacred book gives such prominence to the quality of mercy 
in the Divine Being. While evil must have its evil consequence, it is only its like, 
but virtue brings a tenfold reward. According to a saying of the Holy Prophet, evil 
is pardoned or recompensed with its like, while good brings from a tenfold to a 
seven-hundredfold reward (Bukhari, 81:33). Thus the verse mentions only the 
maximum punishment of evil and the minimum reward of good. 



6:161' THE GOAL FOR THE FAITHFUL 1 89 

161 Say: As for me, my Lord has guided me to the right path 
— a right religion, the faith of Abraham, the upright one, and he 
was not of those who set up partners (with Allah). 162 Say: My 
prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are surely for 
Allah, the Lord of the worlds — 163 no partner has He. And this am 
I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit." 164 Say: 
Shall I seek a Lord other than Allah, while He is the Lord of all 
things? And no soul earns (evil) but against itself. Nor does a 
bearer of burden bear another's burden. Then to your Lord is 
your return, so He will inform you of that in which you differed. 
i 65 And He it is Who has made you successors in the land and 
exalted some of you in rank above others, that He may try you by 
what He has given you. Surely your Lord is Quick in retribution, 
and He is surely the Forgiving, the Merciful. e 



a (163) The idea of entire submission to the Divine Being conveyed in the 
word Islam finds its perfect manifestation in the Holy Prophet, who is the first of 
the Muslims. Above even the noblest object that a person can set for himself stands 
the love of the Divine Being. It is the highest goal of human life, and every Muslim 
is taught to set that goal before himself. 

b (164) In these words the Christian doctrine of atonement is rejected by the 
Quran. Elsewhere we have: "That no bearer of burden bears another's burden, and 
that man can have nothing but what he strives for" (53:38-39). Every person who 
is born is called a bearer of burden, not because he is a sinner, but because he 
starts life with certain responsibilities of his own. 

c (165) With the highest goal of life before them, Muslims are now told that 
they were going to be made rulers in the land. Their exaltation above others, how- 
ever, was not due to their wealth or to their political power but simply to the fact 
that they submitted themselves to God, that their prayers and their sacrifices were 
not for their nation or their country but for God, Who was the Rabb, the Nourisher 
to perfection, of the whole of humanity. Hence they were a people who had the 
betterment of the whole of humanity in view. But even they are told, in the con- 
cluding words of the verse, that if they fall off and follow evil ways they will be 
requited, though the forgiveness and mercy of the Divine Being will ultimately 
take them by the hand. 



Chapter 7 
Ai-A'raf The Elevated Places 

The title of this chapter is taken from the mention of The Elevated Places (v. 
46) on which stand the perfect righteous servants of Allah. The main theme 
of this chapter is the truth of Divine revelation. It illustrates this by referring 
to the histories of several prophets, warning that the opponents of the Holy 
Prophet would meet the same fate as the opponents of the earlier prophets if 
they did not mend their ways. The chapter goes on to relate the history of 
Moses, as the Prophet Muhammad appeared in the likeness of Moses accord- 
ing to prophecies in the Torah. Towards the end, it gives the essence of the 
last and present chapter. This chapter was revealed at Makkah, just prior to 
the Emigration of the Holy Prophet. 



Section 1: Opponents' Doom 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Best Knower, the Truthful. a 2 A Book 
revealed to you — so let there be no worry in your heart con- 
cerning it — that you may warn with it, and a Reminder to the 
believers. c 3 Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord 
and do not follow besides Him any guardians; little mindful are 
you! 

4 And how many a town have We destroyed! So Our punish- 
ment came to it by night or while they slept at midday. 5 Yet their 



a (1) Of the four letters alif, lam, mim, and sad, the first three are the same as 
at the commencement of ch. 2, for which see 2:1 footnote; while sad stands for 
Sadiq, meaning Truthful, Whose promise would not fail. 

b (2-1) This parenthetical passage is introduced to console the Holy Prophet, 
who at this time was encountering the greatest opposition and was surrounded by 
difficulties on all sides. 

c (2-2) The Quran is called a reminder because, being in consonance with 
human nature, it is a reminder of what is imprinted on human nature. It may, how- 
ever, have the alternative meaning of honour or eminence, for which see 2: 1 52.

cry, when Our punishment came to them, was nothing but that 
they said: Surely we were wrongdoers. 6 Then certainly We shall 
question those to whom messengers were sent, and We shall ques- 
tion the messengers, 7 then surely We shall recount to them with 
knowledge, and We are never absent. 

8 And the judging on that day will be just; so as for those 
whose good deeds are heavy, they are the successful. 9 And as for 
those whose good deeds are light, those are they who ruined their 
souls because they disbelieved in Our messages. 10 And certainly 
We established you in the earth and made in it means of livelihood 
for you; little thanks you give! 

Section 2: The Devil's Opposition to Man 

11 And We indeed created you, then We fashioned you, then 
We said to the angels: Be submissive to Adam. So they sub- 
mitted, but not IblTs; he was not of those who submitted. 12 He 
said: What hindered you from submitting when I commanded 
you? He said: I am better than he; You have created me of fire, 
while him You did create of dust. c 13 He said: Then get forth from 
this (state), for it is not for you to behave proudly in it. Go forth, 



a (6) Those to whom messengers were sent will be questioned as to how 
they treated the messengers, and the latter as to how they were received. 

b (11) That what is stated here of Adam is true of all mankind is made clear 
by the opening words of this verse. Human beings are created first, then fashion- 
ed, then the order is given to the angels to make submission to Adam, who in this 
sense typifies a human being. Thus the angels are really required to make sub- 
mission to every human being. 

c (12) Not only is Adam created from dust, but all human beings are spoken 
of as being similarly created; see 3:59 footnote, and see also 18:37, 22:5 and 
30:20. As a contrast to man's creation from dust, the devil claims to have been 
created from fire. There may be a reference here to the nature of the temperaments 
of the two classes, human beings and devils. The Quran says elsewhere: "Man is 
created of haste" (21:37), which means that he is hasty. In like manner the devil's 
creation of fire may mean that he is made of a fiery temperament, while the 
perfect man is humble and meek, being created of dust, which stands for humility 
and meekness. Elsewhere it is stated that the jinn were created of fire (15:27), and 
also that Iblls was one of the jinn (18:50). 



192 7. THE ELEVATED PLACES • 7 : 14 

therefore, surely you are a degraded one. 14 He said: Grant me 
respite till the day when they are raised." 15 He said: Surely jou are 
granted respite. 

16 He said: As You have judged me to be in error, I will 
certainly lie in wait for them in Your straight path, 17 then I shall 
certainly come upon them from in front of them and from behind 
them, and from their right and from their left; and You will not 
find most of them thankful. 18 He said: Get out of it, despised, 
driven away. Whoever of them will follow you, I will certainly fill 
hell with you all. 

19 And (We said): O Adam, dwell you and jour wife in the 
garden, and eat from wherever you wish, but do not go near this 
tree or you would be from among the unjust. 20 But the devil made 
an evil suggestion to them that he might make manifest to them 
their shame that had been hidden from them,' and he said: Your 
Lord has only forbidden you this tree that you may not become 
angels or become immortals. 21 And he swore to them both: Surely 
I am a sincere adviser to you — 22 thus he caused them to fall by 
deceit. So when they had tasted of the tree, their shame became 
manifest to them, and they both began to cover themselves with 
the leaves of the garden. c And their Lord called to them: Did I not 
forbid you that tree, and say to you that the devil is surely your 
open enemy? 23 They said: Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves; 



a (14) The devil's grip continues only so long as man is not spiritually raised 
to life. The raising here stands for the spiritual resurrection of man. If the final 
Resurrection is meant, the significance would be that the devil would mislead man 
so long as man lives on this earth. 

b (20) The devil's suggestions always lead man to the disclosure of his 
shame. 

c (22) The covering with the leaves of the garden is the desire to make up by 
human effort any fault that may have been committed. The clothing that guards 
against evil, which is spoken of in v. 26 as being the best clothing, explains the 
meaning of covering here. Divine revelation points out to man the true way, 
enabling him to cover himself or guard himself against evil. And, further, the state- 
ment in v. 27, pulling off from them both their clothing that he might show them 
their shame shows that covering with the leaves of the garden is an allegorical 
statement; see v. 27 footnote 1. 



7 : 24 • WARNING AGAINST THE DEVIL'S INSINUATIONS 1 93 

and if You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we shall 
certainly be from among the losers. 24 He said: Go forth — some 
of you are enemies of others. And there is for you in the earth an 
abode and a provision for a time. 25 He said: In it shall you live, 
and in it shall you die, and from it shall you be raised. 

Section 3: Warning against the Devil's Insinuations 

26 O children of Adam, We have indeed sent down to you 
clothing to cover your shame and (clothing) for beauty; and 
clothing that guards against evil — that is the best." This is of the 
messages of Allah that they may be mindful. 27 children of 
Adam, do not let the devil seduce you, as he expelled your parents 
from the garden, pulling off from them both their clothing that he 
might show them their shame. He surely sees you, he as well as 
his company, from where you do not see them. Surely We have 
made the devils to be the friends of those who do not believe/ 

28 And when they commit an indecency they say: We found 
our fathers doing this, and Allah has commanded us to do it. Say: 
Surely Allah does not command indecency. Do you say of Allah 
what you do not know? 29 Say: My Lord commands (the doing of) 
justice. And set upright your faces at every time of prayer and call 
on Him, being sincere to Him in obedience. As He brought you 



a (26) Clothing at first simply served to cover shame; with further progress 
people sought to embellish their persons with it; but there is yet a third kind of 
clothing, says the Quran, which is the best, and that is the clothing of piety, 
literally the clothing that guards one against evil. It indicates a further step in the 
progress of man, for virtue is an embellishment of the mind, and when man has 
seen the good of embellishing his person, he will soon be aware of the necessity 
of embellishing his mind. 

b (27-1) That the clothing for the body is not meant here is clear from the 
fact that all men and women are warned against a similar attack of the devil. As to 
the clothing of which Adam was divested, there remains no doubt, when it is seen 
that the devil tries to divest every child of Adam of the same clothing: it is the 
clothing that guards against evil. 

c (27-2) It is because they do not believe in the Truth that the devils are 
made their friends. Those who sever their connection with the Source of purity 
must fall into impurity. 



194 7. THE ELEVATED PLACES • 7 : 30 

into being, so shall you return. 30 Some has He guided, and others 
— error is justly their due." Surely they took the devils for friends 
instead of Allah, and they think that they are rightly guided. 
31 children of Adam, attend to your adornment at every time of 
prayer, and eat and drink and do not be extravagant; surely He 
does not love the extravagant. 

Section 4: Messengers sent for Uplift of Humanity 

32 Say: Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah, c which 
He has brought forth for His servants, and the good provisions? 
Say: These are for the believers in the life of this world, purely 
(theirs) on the day of Resurrection. Thus do We make the mess- 
ages clear for a people who know. 33 Say: My Lord forbids only 
indecencies, such of them as are apparent and such as are con- 
cealed, and sin and unjust rebellion, and that you set up with Allah 
partners for which He has sent down no authority, and that you 
say of Allah what you do not know. 

34 And every nation has a term; so when its term comes they 
cannot postpone it an hour, nor can they bring it forward. 
35 children of Adam, if messengers come to you from among 
you relating to you My messages, then whoever guards against evil 
and acts aright — they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve. 



a (30) Error is justly their due because they have taken the devils for their 
friends. Whoever continues to follow the devil must surely remain in error. 

b (31) Attending to one's adornment carries a double significance here. It 
requires adorning oneself physically, i.e. being clean and clothed appropriately for 
prayer, especially for the Friday and 'Id gatherings. But what is specially aimed at 
is adornment in a spiritual sense. A Muslim must attend to inner beautification, 
for prayer is really meant as an aid to the beauty of the soul. He must come to 
prayer with a heart free from all impurities and full of the highest aspirations and 
noblest sentiments. 

c (32-1) By the adornment of Allah is meant the adornment which Allah has 
made lawful for people to avail themselves of. 

d (32-2) In the life of this world the believer and the disbeliever equally 
benefit by the good things, but in the life after death all good shall be exclusively 
for those who have accepted and acted on the right principles. 



7:36' MESSENGERS SENT FOR UPLIFT OF HUMANITY 1 95 

36 And those who reject Our messages and turn away from them 
haughtily — these are the companions of the Fire; they shall abide 
in it. 

37 Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against 
Allah or rejects His messages? These — their portion of the Book 
shall reach them; a until when Our messengers come to them caus- 
ing them to die, they say: Where are those you used to call upon 
besides Allah? They would say: They are gone away from us. And 
they shall bear witness against themselves that they were disbelie- 
vers. 38 He will say: Enter into the Fire among the nations of jinn 
and people that have passed away before you. Every time a nation 
enters, it curses its sister; until when they all follow one another 
into it, the last of them will say with regard to the first of them: c 
Our Lord, these led us astray, so give them a double punishment 
of the Fire. He will say: Each one has double but you do not 
know. 39 And the first of them will say to the last of them: You 
have no preference over us, so taste the punishment for what you 
earned. 

Section 5: Those who accept the Message 

40 Those who reject Our messages and turn away from them 
haughtily, the doors of heaven will not be opened for them, nor 
will they enter the Garden until the camel pass through the eye of 
the needle. And thus do We reward the guilty. 41 They shall have a 



a (37) That is, the punishment promised in the Book will overtake them. 

b (38-1) By the sister nation is meant the nation which resembles it in its 
deeds. 

c (38-2) By the last and Has first are meant here the common people and the 
leaders, because, though the words would bear both interpretations, i.e. the last 
and the first in time or the last and the first in position, the latter significance is 
corroborated by similar expressions in several other places, such as 2:166, 14:21, 
34:31-33,40:47, etc. 

d (38-3) The common people would desire that the leaders should suffer a 
double torment, for their own sins as well as for having misled others. They are 
told that if the leaders were guilty of misleading them, they themselves deserved a 
double punishment for having blindly followed the leaders.

bed of hell and over them coverings (of it). And thus do We 
recompense the wrongdoers. 42 And as for those who believe and 
do good — We do not impose on any soul a duty beyond its scope 
— they are the owners of the Garden; in it they abide. 43 And We 
shall remove whatever of bitterness is in their hearts — rivers 
flow beneath them. And they say: All praise is due to Allah, Who 
guided us to this! And we would not have found the way if Allah 
had not guided us. Certainly the messengers of our Lord brought 
the truth. And it will be cried out to them: This is the Garden 
which you are made to inherit for what you did. 

44 And the owners of the Garden call out to the companions 
of the Fire: We have found what our Lord promised us to be true; 
have you, too, found what your Lord promised to be true? They will 
say: Yes. Then a crier will cry out among them: The curse of Allah 
is on the wrongdoers, 45 who hinder (people) from Allah's way and 
seek to make it crooked, " and they are disbelievers in the Here- 
after. 46 And between them is a veil. And on the Elevated Places 
are men who know all by their marks.' And they call out to the 
owners of the Garden: Peace be on you! They have not yet entered 
it, though they hope.'' 47 And when their eyes are turned towards 
the companions of the Fire, they say: Our Lord, do not place us 
with the unjust people/ 



a (45) By seeking to make Allah's way crooked is meant that they suggest 
doubts regarding the Truth. 

b (46-1) The veil which here separates the wicked from the righteous and on 
account of which the former fail to see the bliss which the latter enjoy will assume 
a perceptible form in the next life. Thus it is not distance that separates heaven 
from hell but only a veil, and they hear and even see one another. 

c (46-2) The men spoken of here as being on the elevated places (the title of 
this chapter, Al-A 'raf) are the same righteous servants of Allah who are distinctly 
mentioned in 56:10-11: "And the foremost are the foremost — these are drawn 
near to Allah". Besides this, the prophets are again and again spoken of as a class 
by themselves, being witnesses over their people. 

d (46-3) They are, as it were, standing at the door of the Garden, ready to 
enter it. 

e (47) Thus do pray those who hope to enter paradise. 



7 : 48 • HELPLESSNESS OF OPPONENTS 197 

Section 6: Helplessness of Opponents 

48 And the owners of the Elevated Places call out to men 
whom they recognize by their marks, saying: Of no avail were to 
you your amassings a and your arrogance. 49 Are these they about 
whom you swore that Allah would not bestow mercy on them? 
Enter the Garden; you have no fear, nor shall you grieve. 50 And 
the companions of the Fire call out to the owners of the Garden: 
Pour on us some water or some of what Allah has provided for 
you. They say: Surely Allah has forbidden them both to the 
disbelievers, 51 who take their religion for an idle sport and a play, 
and this world's life deceives them. So this day We shall forsake 
them, as they neglected the meeting of this day of theirs, and as 
they denied Our messages. 

52 And certainly We have brought them a Book which We 
make clear with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for a people 
who believe. 53 Do they wait only for its final sequel? On the day 
when its final sequel comes, those who neglected it before will say: 
Indeed the messengers of our Lord brought the truth. Are there 
any intercessors on our behalf so that they should intercede for us? 
Or could we be sent back so that we should do (deeds) other than 
those which we did? Indeed they have lost their souls, and what 
they forged has failed them. 

Section 7: The Righteous will prosper 

54 Surely your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and 
the earth in six periods/ and He is established on the Throne 



a (48) The word used may mean either your amassing worldly wealth, or it 
may mean your multitude or strength in numbers. 

b (53) By final sequel is meant the ultimate state of the perfect manifestation 
of truth by the fulfilment of the prophecies, the end ox the ultimate consequence. 

c (54-1) The word yaum means not only day but also a period, whatever 
period it may be. The six periods of time in which the heavens and the earth are 
created refer in fact to the six stages in which they have grown to their present 
condition. In the case of the earth these six stages are detailed in 41:9-10. 



198 7. THE ELEVATED PLACES • 7 : 55 

of Power." He makes the night cover the day, which it pursues 
incessantly. And (He created) the sun and the moon and the stars, 
made subservient by His command. Surely His is the creation and 
the command. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds! 55 Call on 
your Lord humbly and in secret. Surely He does not love the 
transgressors. 56 And do not make mischief in the earth after its 
reformation, and call on Him, fearing and hoping. Surely the mercy 
of Allah is near to the doers of good.' 

57 And He it is Who sends forth the winds bearing good news 
before His mercy; till, when they bear a laden cloud, We drive it 
to a dead land, then We send down water on it, then bring forth 
thereby fruits of all kinds. Thus do We bring forth the dead that 
you may be mindful/ 58 And the good land — its vegetation comes 



a (54-2) The true significance of the word 'arsh is power or control of the 
creation. It is not a physical throne for sitting on. The phrase "He is established 
on the Throne of Power ( 'arsh)" is used in the Quran here and on six other occa- 
sions, viz., in 10:3, 13:2, 20:5, 25:59, 32:4 and 57:4. It is invariably used after 
mentioning the creation of the heavens and the earth and in relation to the Divine 
control of His creation and the law and order to which the universe is made to 
submit by its great Author, as shown by the words that follow here, His is the 
creation and the command. The meaning is that after creating the universe, God 
has not left it to run its course independently of Him, but He it is Whose command 
holds sway and Who regulates the affairs as He has planned them. 

b (54-3) In the words Rabh al- 'alamin ("Lord of the worlds") there is also a 
deeper reference to the spiritual evolution of man which is being worked out 
under the Divine plan, and the 'arsh is mentioned specially in this connection, as 
man's perfection does not consist in the working of the material laws which 
prevail in the universe but in the spiritual laws which are needed for his per- 
fection. In 40:15 the Lord of the 'arsh is clearly stated to be the Sender of revela- 
tion to man to bring about his spiritual perfection. In 40:7 it is added: "Those who 
bear the 'arsh and those around it celebrate the praise of their Lord and believe in 
Him and ask protection for those who believe". The bearers of the 'arsh or the 
Throne of Power are, in fact, the bearers of the Divine message. 

c (56) The feeling which should be entertained towards Allah should be a 
combination of fear and hope, of awe as well as love, because the fear of His dis- 
pleasure ennobles the mind no less than the hope of His mercy. 

d (57-1) His mercy represents the rain in the physical world. 

e (57-2) The bringing forth of the spiritually dead to life through the revela- 
tion of the Quran is always likened to the bringing of the dead earth to life by rain.

inferior — (its vegetation) comes forth but scantily. Thus do We 
repeat the messages for a people who give thanks. a 

Section 8: Noah 

59 Certainly We sent Noah to his people, so he said: My 
people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. Indeed I 
fear for you the punishment of a grievous day. 60 The chiefs of his 
people said: Surely we see you in clear error. 61 He said: My people, 
there is no error in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the 
worlds. 62 I deliver to you the messages of my Lord, and I offer 
you good advice, and I know from Allah what you do not know. 
63 Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord 
through a man from among you, that he may warn you and that 
you may guard against evil, and that mercy may be shown to you? 

64 But they called him a liar, so We delivered him and those 
with him in the ark, and We drowned those who rejected Our 
messages. Surely they were a blind people! c 



The wind bearing the good news was the movement towards Islam, which was 
daily becoming more and more powerful. 

a (58) Revelation is here likened to the rain and the good or bad nature of 
man to good or inferior land. If some people do not benefit by the revelation, it is 
just as some lands do not benefit by rain. 

b (59) Having warned the opponents of the evil consequences of their oppo- 
sition to the Holy Prophet, several illustrations are now given from sacred history, 
showing how those people were dealt with who refused to listen to the voice of 
the warners. The object is not to narrate history as such, but to bring out common 
characteristics of the histories of different nations, to mention incidents which 
contain prophetical allusion to the Holy Prophet's life and to illustrate the general 
warnings made regarding the ultimate consequences of the rejection of Truth. The 
Quran relates the broad facts that every prophet preached Divine Unity, every 
prophet laid stress on the doing of good, every prophet was received with severe 
opposition, and that every prophet ultimately succeeded in establishing the truth. 

c (64) See further 1 1 :37 — 48 and 23:27-29. The Quran does not support the 
idea of a world deluge, for it states here that Noah was sent only to his people, not 
to all nations. Only the people to whom Noah was sent called him a liar, and only 
those were drowned who rejected the message of Allah delivered through Noah.

Section 9: Hod 

65 And to Ad (We sent) their brother Hud." He said: My 
people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. Will you 
not then guard against evil? 66 The chiefs of those who disbelieved 
from among his people said: Certainly we see you in folly, and we 
certainly think you to be a liar. 67 He said: My people, there is no 
folly in me, but I am a messenger of the Lord of the worlds. 
68 I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and I am a faithful 
adviser to you. 69 Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you 
from your Lord through a man from among you that he may warn 
you? And remember when He made you successors after Noah's 
people and increased you in excellence of make. So remember 
the bounties of Allah, that you may be successful. 70 They said: 
Have you come to us that we may serve Allah alone, and give up 
what our fathers used to serve? Then bring us what you threaten us 
with, if you are truthful. 71 He said: Indeed uncleanness and wrath 
from your Lord have come upon you. Do you dispute with me 
about names which you and your fathers have named? c Allah has 
not sent any authority for them. So wait; I too am waiting along 
with you. 

72 So We delivered him and those with him by mercy from 
Us, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our messages 
and were not believers. 



a (65) Ad was the grandson of Aram (mentioned in 89:7), who was a grand- 
son of Noah, and the tribe of Ad spoken of here is called the first Ad (53:50), as 
distinguished from the tribe of Thamud, which is called the second Ad. This tribe 
lived in the desert of al-Ahqaf (46:21) which is marked on the maps of Arabia and 
extends from Oman to Hadramaut. 

The male member of a tribe is generally spoken of as their brother, as here 
HOd is called. The prophet Hud is the Eber of the Bible, because Hud is said to be 
the grandson of Arphaxad, the grandson of Noah. Compare Genesis 10:24 for 
Eber's genealogy. 

b (69) By making them khulafa ' or successors is meant that they were made 
a ruling nation and possessors of a vast kingdom. 

c (71) The reference here is to their deities. 

d (72) They were destroyed by a storm (69:7). 



7 : 73 • SALIH AND LOT 201 

Section 10: Salih and Lot 

73 And to Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih." He said: 
My people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. Clear 
proof has indeed come to you from your Lord. This is Allah's she- 
camel — a sign for you — so leave her alone to pasture in Allah's 
earth, and do her no harm or a painful punishment will afflict you. 
74 And remember when He made you successors after Ad and 
settled you in the land — you make mansions on its plains and 
carve out houses in the mountains. So remember Allah's bounties 
and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief. 75 The arro- 
gant chiefs of his people said to those who were weak, to those 
who believed from among them: Do you know that Salih is one 
sent by his Lord? They said: Surely we are believers in that with 
which he has been sent. 76 Those who were arrogant said: Surely 
we are disbelievers in what you believe. 

77 Then they hamstrung the she-camel and revolted against 
their Lord's commandment, and said: Salih, bring us what you 
threaten us with, if you are one of the messengers. 78 So the earth- 
quake seized them, and they were motionless bodies in their abodes. 
79 So he turned away from them and said: My people, indeed I 
delivered to you the message of my Lord and gave you good advice, 
but you do not love good advisers. c 

80 And (We sent) Lot, when he said to his people: Do you 



a (73-1) Ad and Thamud, though two nearly related tribes, were separated 
both as regards time and place. Thamud is known after a grandson of Aram, the 
grandson of Noah. Historical traces of it are met with in Ptolemy. The tribe flouri- 
shed more than two hundred years after Ad, and occupied the territory known as 
al-Hijr (15:80), and the plain known by the name of Wadi-1-Qura, which forms 
the southern boundary of Syria and the northern one of Arabia. Salih was a des- 
cendant in the sixth generation after Thamud. 

b (73-2) It is called Allah 's she-camel because it was given as a sign from 
Allah. It was an ordinary she-camel, which was given as a sign to a people. Their 
slaying of it was a sign that they would neither accept the truth, nor cease persecu- 
ting Salih and his followers. 

c (79) This evidently refers to the survivors from the great disaster. 

d (80) Lot is one of those prophets who have been maligned in the Bible. He

commit foul deeds which no one in the world did before you? 
81 Surely you come to males with lust instead of females. Indeed, 
you are a people exceeding bounds. 82 And the answer of his people 
was only that they said: Turn them out of your town; surely they 
are a people who aspire to purity! 83 So We delivered him and his 
followers, except his wife — she was among those who remained 
behind. 84 And We rained upon them a rain. a See, then, what was 
the end of the guilty! 

Section 1 1 : Shuaib 

85 And to Midian (We sent) their brother Shuaib. He said: 
My people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. Clear 
proof indeed has come to you from your Lord, so give full measure 
and weight and do not diminish to people their things^ nor make 
mischief in the land after its reform. This is better for you, if you 
are believers. 86 Nor lie in wait on every road, threatening and 
turning away from Allah's way him who believes in Him and 
seeking to make it crooked. And remember when you were few, 
then He multiplied you, and see what was the end of the mischief- 
makers! 87 And if there are some of you who believe in what I am 
sent with, and others who do not believe, then wait patiently till 
Allah judges between us; and He is the Best of judges. 

88 The arrogant chiefs of his people said: We will certainly 
3- turn you out, Shuaib, and those who believe with you from our 
town, or you shall come back to our religion. He said: Even though 
we dislike (it)? 89 Indeed we should have forged a lie against Allah, 



was considered a righteous servant by Abraham (Genesis, 18:23), but a little 
further on in the same book we are told that Lot was guilty of incestuous inter- 
course with his daughters. The record there has evidently been manipulated. 

a (84) The punishment which overtook the people of Lot is frequently called 
rain, while in 11:82 and 15:74 stones are said to have been rained down upon 
them. See also 54:34. It was a volcanic eruption combined with an earthquake. 

b (85-1) Shuaib was a descendant of Abraham in the fifth generation. It is 
generally supposed to be another name for Jethro of the Bible (Exodus, 3:1). 

c (85-2) The injunction do not diminish to people their things stands for not 
depriving or defrauding people of their rights.

if we go back to your religion after Allah has delivered us from it. 
And it is not for us to go back to it, unless Allah our Lord please. 
Our Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. In Allah do 
we trust. Our Lord, decide between us and our people with truth, 
and You are the Best of deciders. 90 And the chiefs of his people, 
who disbelieved, said: If you follow Shuaib, you are surely losers. 

91 So the earthquake overtook them, and they were motion- 
less bodies in their homes — 92 Those who called Shuaib a liar 
were as though they had never dwelt there — those who called 
Shuaib a liar, they were the losers. 93 So he turned away from them 
and said: My people, indeed I delivered to you the messages of 
my Lord and I gave you good advice; how, then, should I be sorry 
for a disbelieving people? 

Section 12: Makkans warned of Punishment 

94 And We did not send a prophet to a town but We seized its 
people with distress and affliction that they might humble them- 
selves." 95 Then We changed the evil for good, till they became 
affluent and said: Distress and happiness did indeed touch our 
fathers. So We took them by surprise while they did not perceive. 
96 And if the people of the towns had believed and kept their duty, 
We would certainly have opened for them blessings from the 
heavens and the earth. But they rejected, so We seized them for 
what they earned. 97 Are the people of the towns, then, secure from 
Our punishment coming to them by night while they sleep? 
98 0r, are the people of the towns secure from Our punishment 
coming to them in the morning while they play? "Are they 
secure from Allah's plan? But none feels secure from Allah's plan 
except the people who perish. 



a (94) That the histories of the nations are meant as a warning to all oppo- 
nents of truth is evident. It is also plain that even afflictions and distress sent on a 
people are meant for their spiritual betterment, that they might humble themselves. 

b (98) The playing may be taken either literally or it may indicate the 
worldly engagements in which they were occupied to the utter neglect of higher 
aspirations.

Section 13: Moses sent to Pharaoh with Signs 

100 Is it not clear to those who inherit the earth after its 
(former) residents that, if We please, We would afflict them for 
their sins, and seal their hearts so they would not hear? 101 Such 
were the towns some of whose news We have related to you. And 
certainly their messengers came to them with clear arguments, but 
they would not believe what they had rejected before. Thus does 
Allah seal the hearts of the disbelievers. 102 And We did not find in 
most of them (faithfulness to) covenant; and We found most of 
them to be transgressors. 

103 Then, after them, We sent Moses " with Our messages to 
Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they disbelieved them. See, then, what 
was the end of the mischief-makers! 104 And Moses said: O Pharaoh, 
surely I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds, i° 5 worthy of 
not saying anything about Allah except the truth. I have come to 
you indeed with clear proof from your Lord, so let the Children of 
Israel go with me. i° 6 He said: If you have come with a sign, 
produce it, if you are truthful. 107 So he threw down his staff, then 
lo! it was an obvious snake. 108 And he drew forth his hand, and lo! 
it was white to the onlookers. 



a (103) The history of Moses is here taken up in detail. The Holy Prophet 
Muhammad had more in common with Moses than with any other prophet, and he 
is called the like of Moses in the Mosaic prophecies. 

b (108) It is nowhere stated that whenever Moses threw down his rod it 
turned into a snake. Only on two occasions the rod is stated to have turned into a 
snake: (1) when Moses held communion with God before going to Pharaoh; 
(2) when he first came before Pharaoh, or when Pharaoh summoned the enchan- 
ters to his help. On the first of these occasions the rod was seen turning into a 
snake by Moses alone, when he was in a state of vision — the state in which a 
prophet is temporarily transported to a spiritual sphere. On the latter occasion 
others besides Moses witnessed the change, but it is a fact that the effect of 
inspired vision is sometimes so strong that others besides the seer partake in it. 

Whatever their real nature, these miracles of Moses were not mere play. The 
great truth underlying the rod or staff turning into a snake was that the followers 
of Moses, as represented by his rod, would prevail over their enemies; and the sig- 
nificance underlying the whitening of Moses' hand was that his arguments would 
shine forth with clearness. 



7 : 109 • PHARAOH SUMMONS ENCHANTERS 205 

Section 14: Pharaoh summons Enchanters 

109 The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: Surely this is a 
skilful enchanter! 110 He intends to turn you out of your land. 
(Pharaoh said:) What do you advise? m They said: Put him off and 
his brother, and send heralds into the cities, 112 to bring to you 
every skilful enchanter. 

113 And the enchanters came to Pharaoh, saying: We must 
surely have a reward if we prevail. 114 He said: Yes, and you shall 
certainly be among those who are near (to me). 

115 They said: Moses, will you throw, or shall we (be the first 
to) throw? 116 He said: You throw. So when they threw, they decei- 
ved the people's eyes and overawed them, and they produced a 
mighty enchantment. 117 And We revealed to Moses: Throw down 
jour staff. Then lo! it swallowed up their lies. 118 So the truth was 
established, and what they did became null. 119 There they were 
defeated, and they went back humiliated. 

120 And the enchanters fell down prostrate — 121 They said: 
We believe in the Lord of the worlds, 122 the Lord of Moses and 
Aaron. 123 Pharaoh said: You believe in Him before I give you per- 
mission! Surely this is a plot which you have plotted in the city, to 
turn out of it its people, but you shall know! n4 I shall certainly cut 
off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, then I shall crucify 
you all together! 125 They said: Surely to our Lord do we return. 
m And you take revenge on us only because we believed in the 
messages of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord, pour out 
on us patience and cause us to die in submission (to You)! " 



a (126) The Bible does not speak of the magicians as believing in the Divine 
mission of Moses when they were vanquished, but according to Rabbinical litera- 
ture, some Egyptians accompanied Moses when he departed from Egypt. It should 
be noted that the magicians could not have believed unless they had heard the 
arguments of Moses as to the existence of God and as to a life after death in 
which they now believed so staunchly that they were ready to sacrifice their very 
lives for their faith. It shows that Moses had explained the essential religious 
truths to the whole gathering before he showed the signs.

Section 15: Persecution of Israelites continues 

127 And the chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: Will you leave 
Moses and his people to make mischief in the land and forsake 
you and your gods? He said: We will kill their sons and spare their 
women, and surely we are dominant over them. 128 Moses said to 
his people: Ask help from Allah and be patient. Surely the land is 
Allah's — He gives it for an inheritance to such of His servants as 
He pleases. And the end is for those who keep their duty. 129 They 
said: We were persecuted before you came to us and since you 
have come to us. He said: It may be that your Lord will destroy 
your enemy and make you rulers in the land, then He will see how 
you act. a 

Section 16: Moses shows more Signs 

130 And certainly We overtook Pharaoh's people with droughts 
and shortage of fruits that they might be mindful. 131 But when 
good befell them they said: This is due to us. And when evil 
afflicted them, they attributed it to the ill-luck of Moses and those 
with him. Surely their evil fortune is only from Allah, but most of 
them do not know. 132 And they said: Whatever sign you may 
bring us to charm us with it — we shall not believe in you. 133 So 
We sent upon them widespread death, and the locusts and the lice 
and the frogs and the blood — clear signs. But they behaved 
haughtily and they were a guilty people. 

134 And when the plague fell upon them, they said: Moses, 
pray for us to your Lord as He has made promise with you. If you 
remove the plague from us, we will certainly believe in you and 
will let the Children of Israel go with you. 135 But when We re- 
moved the plague from them till a term which they should attain, 



a (129) By the land is meant the Promised Land, for it was there that Moses 
was taking them. Their being made rulers in the land was conditional upon their 
doing good; this is suggested in the concluding words of the verse. 

b (131) Their evil fortune is from Allah means that the misfortunes which 
they were made to suffer were brought about by Allah as a result of their own evil 
deeds.

lo! they broke (their promise)." 136 So We exacted retribution from 
them and drowned them in the sea, because they rejected Our 
signs and were heedless of them. 137 And We made the people who 
were considered weak to inherit the eastern lands and the western 
ones which We had blessed. And the good word of your Lord was 
fulfilled in the Children of Israel — because of their patience. 
And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people had produced and 
what they had built. 

138 And We took the Children of Israel across the sea. Then 
they came to a people who were devoted to their idols. They said: 
Moses, make for us a god as they have gods. e He said: Surely you 
are an ignorant people! 139 (As to) these, what they are engaged in 
shall be destroyed and what they do is futile. 140 He said: Shall I 
seek for you a god other than Allah, while He has made you excel 
(all) created things? i 41 And when We delivered you from Pharaoh's 
people, who subjected you to severe torment, killing your sons and 
sparing your women. And in it there was a great trial from your 
Lord. 

Section 17: Moses receives the Law 

142 And We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed 
them with ten, so the appointed time of his Lord was complete 



a (135) A reference to Exodus, ch. 8—11, will show that Pharaoh again and 
again broke his promise to let the Children of Israel go — promises which he 
made on condition that a certain affliction should be removed. 

b (137) The land that was blessed is none other than the Holy Land, for 
which a Divine promise was given to Abraham. The good word referred to here is 
that contained in Genesis 17:8. The eastern and the western lands might signify 
the eastern and the western tracts of the Holy Land, or the lands on the eastern 
and western sides of the Jordan. 

c (138) The Israelites undoubtedly came across idolatrous nations in their 
wanderings. They themselves had idolatrous leanings: "...the people gathered 
together to Aaron, and said to him, Come, make us gods that shall go before us" 
(Exodus, 32:1). Many other anecdotes show a similar tendency to idol-worship. 

rf(140) Moses' argument against idolatry is the one to which the Quran 
repeatedly calls attention, namely, that man, being as it were the lord of creation 
under God, and excelling the whole of creation, should not take objects lower 
than himself as his gods. 



208 7. THE ELEVATED PLACES • 7 : 143 

forty nights. And Moses said to his brother Aaron: Take my place 
among my people, and act well and do not follow the way of the 
mischief-makers. 143 And when Moses came at Our appointed time 
and his Lord spoke to him, he said: My Lord, show me (Yourself) 
so that I may look at You. He said: Fou cannot see Me, but look at 
the mountain; if it remains firm in its place, then will you see Me. 
So when his Lord manifested His glory to the mountain, He made 
it crumble and Moses fell down fainting." Then when he recovered, 
he said: Glory be to You! I turn to You, and I am the first of the 
believers. 144 He said: O Moses, surely I have chosen you above 
the people by My messages and My words. So take hold of what I 
give you and be of the grateful ones. 

145 And We ordained for him in the tablets admonition of 
every kind and clear explanation of all things. So take hold of 
these (teachings) with firmness and command your people to take 
hold of the best of these. I shall show you the abode of the trans- 
gressors. 146 I shall turn away from My messages those who are 
unjustly proud in the earth. And if they see every sign, they will 
not believe in it; and if they see the way of rectitude, they do not 
take it for a way; and if they see the way of error, they take it for a 
way. This is because they reject Our messages and are heedless of 
them. 147 And those who reject Our messages and the meeting of 



a (143) The words You cannot see Me negative the seeing of the Divine 
Being with the physical eye. Moses' request seems to have been based on the 
elders' demand spoken of in 2:55. I venture, however, another explanation. What 
Moses wanted to see was the great manifestation of Divine glory which was reser- 
ved for the Holy Prophet Muhammad. In fact, both Moses and Jesus were not 
equal to the task which was reserved for the Prophet Muhammad. Jesus said that 
he could not teach his followers all things, but that when the Comforter made his 
appearance he would guide them into all truth. That Moses was unequal to the 
Holy Prophet's task was clearly demonstrated by his falling down in a swoon 
when he beheld the Great Manifestation. 

b (145-1) The words admonition of every kind and explanation of all things 
cannot be taken generally, but are limited by the requirements of the time in which 
Moses appeared. 

c (145-2) The meaning is that a time will come to the Israelites when they 
will become transgressors, i.e. they will not keep the Divine commandments. 



7 : 148 • ISRAELITES WORSHIP A CALF 209 

the Hereafter — their deeds are fruitless. Can they be rewarded 
except for what they do? 

Section 18: Israelites worship a Calf 

148 And Moses' people made of their ornaments a calf after 
him — a (lifeless) body, having a lowing sound." Could they not 
see that it did not speak to them, nor guided them in the way? 
They took it (for worship) and they were unjust. 149 And when they 
repented and saw that they had gone astray, they said: If our Lord 
have not mercy on us and forgive us, we shall certainly be losers. 

150 And when Moses returned to his people, angry, grieved, 
he said: Evil is what you have done after me! Did you hasten on 
the judgment of your Lord? And he threw down the tablets and 
seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards him. (Aaron) 
said: Son of my mother, the people reckoned me weak and had 
almost killed me. So do not make the enemies to rejoice over me 
and do not count me among the unjust people. 151 (Moses) said: 
My Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us to Your 
mercy, and You are the most Merciful of those who show mercy.' 

Section 19: The Torah and the Prophet's Advent 

152 Those who took the calf (for a god) — wrath from their 
Lord, and disgrace in this world's life, will surely come upon them. 



a (148) The word jasad means a body, as well as red or intensely yellow. 
The former meaning indicates that the calf was a mere lifeless body, yet it was so 
made that it gave a lowing sound like that of a calf. The other meaning also pro- 
vides a true description of the calf as it was made of gold ornaments. 

b (149) The Israelites' repentance, though mentioned first, was subsequent to 
Moses' return (2:54). The order here connects the repentance with the sin. 

c (151) Aaron's excuse and Moses' acceptance of it show clearly that Aaron 
was quite innocent, having had a share neither in making the calf nor in wor- 
shipping it. The Bible account, which makes a righteous prophet of God guilty of 
the most heinous crime, must be rejected as untrue. That forgiveness was not 
sought for any fault in connection with calf-worship is clear from the fact that 
Moses joins himself with Aaron in the prayer given in this verse. Forgiveness 
here, as frequently elsewhere in the Quran, is equivalent to the Divine protection 
which everyone should seek against the shortcomings of human nature. 



210 7. THE ELEVATED PLACES "7:153 

And thus do We recompense those who invent lies. 153 And those 
who do evil deeds, then repent after that and believe — your Lord 
after that is surely Forgiving, Merciful. 154 And when Moses' anger 
calmed down, he took up the tablets; and in the writing thereof 
was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord. 

155 And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our 
appointment." So when the earthquake struck them, he said: My 
Lord, if You had pleased, You would have destroyed them before 
and myself (too). Will You destroy us for what the foolish among 
us have done? It is only Your trial. You cause to perish by it 
whom You please and guide whom You please. You are our Pro- 
tector, so forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are the Best 
of those who forgive. 156 And ordain for us good in this world's 
life and in the Hereafter, for surely we turn to You. He said: I 
afflict with My punishment whom I please, and My mercy encom- 
passes all things. So I ordain it for those who keep their duty and 
give the due charity, and those who believe in Our messages — 
1S7 those who follow the Messenger-Prophet, the Umml, c whom 
they find mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel. He enjoins 



a (155) Exodus 24: 1 speaks of Moses having taken up seventy elders of 
Israel along with him, though they were forbidden to "come near the Lord", and 
on this occasion Moses was in the mountain forty days and forty nights (Exodus, 
24:18). Although the Bible also speaks of Moses as going to the mountain for 
forty days and forty nights after the incident of the calf-worship (Exodus, 34:28), 
the Quran refers only to the first occasion. 

b (156) No attribute of God receives such prominence in the Quran as the 
attribute of mercy — My mercy encompasses all things. Even punishment is a 
phase of Divine mercy because it seeks to correct the evil-doers. 

c (157-1) UmmT means one who neither writes nor reads a writing. Hence 
the Arabs are called an ummT people, and the UmmT Prophet is either the prophet 
of the ummT people (i.e. the Arabs) because he was like them, or he was so called 
because he himself did not know reading and writing. But according to some, the 
prophet is called UmmT because he came from the Umm al-Qura, i.e. Makkah, 
which is the Metropolis of Arabia. 

d (157-2) There are many prophecies regarding the advent of the Holy Pro- 
phet in the Bible. The Torah and the Gospel are specially mentioned here because 
Moses and Jesus were respectively the first and the last of the Israelite prophets. 
Deuteronomy 18:15-18 speaks very clearly of the raising of a prophet, who shall

good things and prohibits for them impure things, and removes 
from them their burden and the shackles which were on them. So 
those who believe in him and honour him and help him, and 
follow the light which has been sent down with him — these are 
the successful. 

Section 20: Divine Favours on Israelites 

158 Say: O mankind, surely I am the Messenger of Allah to

believes in Allah and His words, and follow him so that you may 
be guided aright. 

159 And of Moses' people is a party who guide with truth and 
with it they do justice.* i fi0 And We divided them into twelve 
tribes, as nations. And We revealed to Moses when his people

or the Arabs, while Deuteronomy 33:2 speaks of the shining forth of the manifes- 
tation of the Lord, i.e. his coming in full glory "from Mount Paran". The Gospel 
is full of prophecies of the advent of the Holy Prophet; Matthew 21 :33^44, Mark 
12:1-11, Luke 20:9-18, where the Lord of the vineyard comes after the son (i.e. 
Jesus) is maltreated, and Matthew 13:31-32, John 1:21, John 14:16, John 14:26 
all contain such prophecies. 

a (158) As against the various prophets spoken of in this chapter, every one 
of whom was sent to his people, the Prophet Muhammad is here spoken of as hav- 
ing been sent to all people, to the whole of mankind. Thus the appearance of the 
Prophet Muhammad was a turning point in the history of humanity. The day of 
the national prophet was over and a new era had dawned in which the whole of 
humanity was ultimately to be united under one spiritual head. The idea of nation- 
ality had to give place to the broader idea of one humanity, and the basis of it was 
laid by the Quran. 

b (159) Thus the Quran recognizes that there were good people among the 
Jews. See also v. 168.

own souls. 

161 And when it was said to them: Dwell in this town and eat 
from it wherever you wish, and make petition for forgiveness, and 
enter the gate submissively, We shall forgive you your wrongs. 
We shall give more to the doers of good. 162 But those who were 
unjust among them changed it for a word other than that which 
they were told, so We sent upon them a pestilence from heaven

When they violated the Sabbath, when their fish came to them on 
their Sabbath day on the surface, and when it was not their 
Sabbath they did not come to them. Thus did We try them because 
they transgressed. 164 And when some of them said: Why do you 
preach to a people whom Allah would destroy or whom He would 
punish with a severe punishment? They said: To be free from 
blame before your Lord, and that perhaps they may guard against 
evil. 165 So when they neglected what they had been reminded of, 
We delivered those who forbade evil and We overtook those who 
were wrongdoers with an evil punishment because they trans- 
gressed. 

166 So when they revoltingly persisted in what they had been 
forbidden, We said to them: Be (as) apes, despised and hated.

b (163) The city referred to here is generally recognized as being Ela, which 
was situated on the Red Sea. The incident alluded to is mentioned as an instance 
of the Jewish violation of the Sabbath. The fish appeared on the surface of the 
water on the Sabbath because they had a sense of security on that day. This was a 
temptation for the people to break the law.

are otherwise. And We tried them with blessings and misfortunes 
that they might turn. 

169 Then after them came an evil generation who inherited the 
Book, taking the frail goods of this low life and saying: It will be 
forgiven us. And if (more) such good came to them, they would 
take it (too). a Was not a promise taken from them in the Book that 
they would not speak anything about Allah but the truth? And 
they study what is in it. And the abode of the Hereafter is better 
for those who keep their duty. Do you not then understand? 
170 And as for those who hold fast by the Book and keep up prayer 
— surely We do not waste the reward of the reformers. m And 
when We shook the mountain over them as if it were a covering, 
and they thought that it was going to fall down upon them: Hold 
on firmly what We have given you, and bear in mind what is in it, 
so that you may guard against evil. 4 

Section 22: Evidence of Divine Impress on Man's Nature 

172 And when jour Lord brought forth from the children of 
Adam, from their loins, their descendants, and made them bear 
witness about themselves: Am I not your Lord? They said: Yes, we 
bear witness. c In case you should say on the day of Resurrection: 
We were unaware of this, 173 or you should say: Only our fathers 



a (169) First they commit a crime for the frail goods of this life, saying that 
they will be forgiven; then persist in their evil course and when a similar occasion 
arises, they again return to the old crimes. There is no repentance. 

b (171) The stories built upon these simple words by some commentators 
must be rejected. The words simply relate the experience of the elders of Israel 
when they stood at the foot of the mountain, which rose above them. There was a 
severe earthquake, which is referred to in v. 155, causing them to think that the 
mountain would fall down upon them. 

c (172) The verse does not mention the bringing forth of descendants from 
Adam, but from the children of Adam, and this seems clearly to refer to every 
human being as he comes into existence. The evidence is, therefore, given by 
human nature itself. It is, in fact, the same evidence which is elsewhere spoken of 
as being afforded by human nature as in "the nature made by Allah in which He 
has created mankind" (30:30).

set up partners (with Allah) before (us), and we were (their) 
descendants after them. Will You destroy us for what liars did? 
174 And thus do We make the messages clear, and that perhaps they 
may return. 

175 And recite to them the news of him to whom We give 
Our messages, but he withdraws himself from them, so the devil 
follows him up, and he is of those who perish." 176 And if We had 
pleased, We would have exalted him thereby; but he clings to the 
earth and follows his low desire. His parable is as the parable of 
the dog — if you drive him away, he lolls out his tongue, and if 
you leave him alone, he lolls out his tongue. Such is the parable of 
the people who reject Our messages. So relate the narrative that 
they may reflect. 177 Evil is the likeness of the people who reject 
Our messages and wrong their own souls. 178 He whom Allah guides 
is on the right way; and he whom He leaves in error — they are 
the losers. 

179 And certainly We have created for hell many of the jinn 
and the people — they have hearts with which they do not under- 
stand, and they have eyes with which they do not see, and they 
have ears with which they do not hear. c They are as cattle; rather, 
they are more astray. These are the heedless ones. 180 And Allah's 
are the best names, so call on Him thereby d and leave alone those 



a (175) This verse speaks generally of everyone to whom guidance is brought 
but he turns aside from it. This view is corroborated by what is stated at the con- 
clusion of the parable in v. 176, such is the parable of the people who reject Our 
messages. 

b (176) Earth here stands for all that is earthly, for things material. The 
people spoken of here are those who do not care for the higher values of life. 

c (179) Many people and jinn are created for hell, but they are none other 
than the heedless ones who do not care for what is said. Allah has not created 
them differently from others, but they themselves do not use the faculties which 
Allah has granted them. 

d (180-1) By the best names are meant names expressing the most excellent 
attributes of the Divine Being. By calling on Him thereby is meant that man 
should always keep the Divine attributes before his mind, endeavouring to possess 
those attributes.

who violate the sanctity of His names." They will be recompensed 
for what they do. 181 And of those whom We have created is a 
community who guide with the truth and with it they do justice. 

Section 23: The Coming of the Doom 

182 And those who reject Our messages — We lead them (to 
destruction) step by step from where they do not know. 183 And I 
grant them respite. Surely My scheme is effective. 184 Do they not 
reflect (that) there is no madness in their companion? He is only a 
plain warner. 185 Do they not consider the kingdom of the heavens 
and the earth and what things Allah has created, and that it may be 
that their doom has drawn near? In what announcement after this 
will they then believe? 186 Whomsoever Allah leaves in error, there 
is no guide for him. And He leaves them alone in their inordinacy, 
blindly wandering on. 

187 They ask you about the Hour, c when will it take place? 
Say: Its knowledge is with my Lord only. None but He will mani- 
fest it at its time. It is momentous in the heavens and the earth. It 
will not come to you but suddenly. They ask you as if you could 
find out about it (by effort). Say: Its knowledge is with Allah only, 
but most people do not know. 188 Say: I do not control benefit nor 
harm for myself except as Allah please. And if I had known the 
unseen, I should have much of good, and no evil would touch me. 
I am but a warner and the giver of good news to a people who 
believe. 



a (180-2) Violation of the sanctity of His names is of two kinds: firstly, 
giving Him an improper or inaccurate attribute; and secondly, to interpret His 
attributes in a manner which does not befit Him. 

b (183) The word kaid (scheme), in relation to God, indicates skill in the 
management or ordering of affairs. 

c (187) That is, the Hour with which they are threatened as being the hour of 
their doom. The word sa 'ah or the hour is used in the Quran to indicate both the 
doom of the guilty in this life and the time when a perfect manifestation of rewards 
and punishments will take place in the Hereafter. 

rf(188) The simplicity and nobility of this statement as indicating the 
mission of a prophet is unsurpassed. He gives glad news of triumph to those who

189 He it is Who created you from a single soul, and of the 
same did He make his mate, that he might find comfort in her. So 
when he covers her she bears a light burden, then moves about 
with it. Then when it grows heavy, they both call upon Allah, their 
Lord: If You give us a good one, we shall certainly be grateful. 
190 But when He gives them a good one, they set up with Him part- 
ners in what He has given them." Supremely exalted is Allah above 
what they set up as partners (with Him). 191 Do they set up (with 
Him) that which has not created anything, while they are them- 
selves created? 192 And they cannot give them help, nor can they 
help themselves. 

193 And if you invite them to guidance, they will not follow 
you. It is the same to you whether you invite them or you are silent. 
194 Those whom you call on besides Allah are slaves like your- 
selves; so call on them, then let them answer you, if you are 
truthful. 195 Do they have feet with which they walk, or do they 
have hands with which they hold, or do they have eyes with which 
they see, or do they have ears with which they hear? Say: Call 
upon your associate-gods then plot against me and give me no 
respite. 196 Surely my Friend is Allah, Who revealed the Book, and 
He befriends the righteous. 197 And those whom you call upon 
besides Him are not able to help you, nor can they help them- 
selves.

you see them looking towards you, yet they do not see. 199 Take to

well as in the next, but he does not claim the possession of Divine powers. 

a (190) This describes the condition of man in general and refers to the 
evidence of his nature, for when in distress he always turns to Allah, but when in 
ease he goes after other gods or his own low desires. 

b (193) Invitation to Truth must be extended to all, though some may not 
benefit by it. The meaning is further clarified in verses 198-199.

200 And if a false imputation from the devil afflict .you," seek refuge 
in Allah. Surely He is Hearing, Knowing. 201 Those who guard 
against evil, when a visitation from the devil afflicts them, they 
become mindful, then lo! they see. 202 And their brethren c 
increase them in error, then they do not cease. 

203 And when you do not bring them a sign, they say: Why 
do you not demand it? Say: I follow only what is revealed to me 
from my Lord. These are clear proofs from your Lord and a 
guidance and a mercy for a people who believe. 204 And when the 
Quran is recited, listen to it and remain silent, that mercy may be 
shown to you. 205 And remember your Lord within yourself humbly 
and fearing, and in a voice not loud, in the morning and the 
evening, and do not be one of the heedless. 206 Surely those who 
are with your Lord are not too proud to serve Him, and they 
glorify Him and prostrate themselves before Him. 



a (200) The devil in this case, as frequently in the Quran, stands for the 
devilish enemies who spread all kinds of false reports concerning the Holy Pro- 
phet, against which he is told to seek refuge in Allah. 

b (201) The visitation of the devil means the happening of any grievous inci- 
dent or the coming of an affliction from the hands of the devil, or the wicked 
acting in opposition to the righteous. Being endowed with insight, they see their 
way out of the affliction. The devil's visitation may also signify anger which 
blinds a man, and those who guard against evil are not blinded by it. 

c (202) That is, the brethren of the devils, or the devil's human associates. 



Chapter 8 
Ai-Anfai Voluntary Gifts 

This chapter deals with the battle of Badr, the first battle which the Muslims 
had to fight, and it goes under the name of Anfal, literally voluntary gifts, 
because the Muslim State had at the time no treasury, nor any arsenal, nor an 
army and voluntary gifts were therefore called for. It was not only this battle 
but all the succeeding battles which Muslims had to fight were carried on only 
by voluntary gifts. Success in this battle, against all odds, provided proof of 
the truth of the Holy Prophet's mission and thus this chapter occurs after a dis- 
cussion of prophethood in the last chapter. Most of this chapter was revealed 
in 2 A.H., while the concluding verses of sections 7 and 8 were revealed 
around the time of the conquest of Makkah in 8 A.H. 



Section 1 : The Battle of Badr — Muslims go forth 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 They ask you about voluntary gifts. Say: Voluntary gifts are 
for Allah and the Messenger/ So keep your duty to Allah and set 
aright your differences, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if you 
are believers. 2 They only are believers whose hearts are full of 
fear when Allah is mentioned, and when His messages are recited 
to them they increase them in faith, and in their Lord do they trust, 
3 those who keep up prayer and spend (on good works) out of what 
We have given them. 4 These are the believers truly. For them are 
with their Lord exalted grades and protection and an honourable 
sustenance. 



a (1) There is much difference of opinion among the commentators as to 
what is meant by anfal here. The most generally received opinion is that it means 
property acquired during the war. I take the word anfal as carrying here its literal 
significance of voluntary gifts for the advancement of the cause of Islam, such 
voluntary gifts being most needed at a time when the very life of Islam was threat- 
ened. Indeed there is no better justification for a war than that it is carried on by 
the voluntary gifts of those whose life is in danger. It is the only war that is really 
carried on by the people in self-defence.

8:5' THE BATTLE OF BADR 219 

5 Even as your Lord caused you to go forth from your house 
with truth, though some of the believers were surely averse," 
disputing with you about the truth after it had become clear — as 
if they were being driven to death while they saw (it). 7 And when 
Allah promised you one of the two parties that it should be yours, 
and you loved that the one not armed should be yours, and Allah 
desired to establish the Truth by His words, c and to cut off the root 
of the disbelievers — 8 that He might cause the Truth to triumph 
and bring falsehood to failure, though the guilty disliked. 

9 When you sought the aid of your Lord, so He answered you: 
I will assist you with a thousand of the angels following one an- 
other. 10 And Allah gave it only as good news, and that your hearts 



a (5) The circumstances of the battle of Badr have been misunderstood. It is 
alleged that the Holy Prophet had made preparations for attacking an unarmed 
caravan of the Quraish on its way back from Syria to Makkah, when Abu Sufyan, 
the caravan leader, sent word to Makkah and obtained an escort of nearly a 
thousand men. If the Holy Prophet had desired to plunder the caravan when it 
approached Madinah, he would have done so long before Abu Sufyan could 
obtain assistance from Makkah, as Madinah was thirteen days' journey from 
Makkah. Badr lies at a distance of three days' journey from Madinah. The enemy 
had marched forth for ten days and the Muslims only for three days when the two 
forces encountered each other at Badr, which shows clearly that the Muslims had 
turned out to take the defensive against an invading force. It is clearly stated here 
that some of the believers were averse to fighting. They could not have been 
averse if they had to encounter only an unarmed caravan. It is said in the next 
verse that they went forth as if they were being driven to death. They knew that 
they were going to meet an enemy treble in numbers and much more powerful 
and efficient. 

b (7-1) The two parties referred to were the unarmed caravan of the Quraish 
going to Makkah and the armed force of the Quraish that was on its way to 
Madinah. Naturally, some of the Muslims desired that their encounter should take 
place with the unarmed Quraish caravan. 

c (7-2) By His words is meant here the fulfilment of His words, because the 
Holy Prophet had declared at Makkah long before that an encounter would take 
place between the Muslims and the Quraish, in which the former would be victo- 
rious. The Holy Prophet himself repeated one of these prophecies aloud in the 
field when he prayed on the day of Badr: "Soon shall the armies be routed, and 
they will show their backs" (54:45).

might be at ease by it. a And victory is only from Allah; surely 
Allah is Mighty, Wise. 

Section 2: The Battle of Badr — Fighting 

11 When He made slumber fall on you as a security from 
Him, and sent down upon you water from the clouds that He 
might purify you with it,* and take away from you the uncleanness 
of the devil, and that He might fortify your hearts and make firm 
(your) feet by it. e 12 When jour Lord revealed to the angels: I am 
with you, so make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into 
the hearts of those who disbelieve. So strike above the necks and 
strike every finger-tip of them. 13 This is because they opposed 
Allah and His Messenger. And whoever opposes Allah and His 
Messenger — then surely Allah is Severe in retribution. 14 This — 
taste it, and (know) that for the disbelievers is the punishment of 
the Fire. 



a (10) See 3:124 footnote. It is nowhere stated in the Quran that the angels 
actually fought, but here, as in 3:126, we are told that the angels were sent down 
to bear good news of victory and to ease the hearts of the Muslims. Here, how- 
ever, we are further told that, as a result of the coming of the angels, calm fell 
upon the Muslims, their hearts being strengthened and their footsteps being 
steadied (v. 11), and that while the believers were thus made firm, terror was cast 
into the hearts of the disbelievers (v. 12). Hence it is that the number of angels 
corresponds with the strength of the enemy force in each case. 

b (11-1) Compare 25:25, which is a prophecy about the events of this 
remarkable battle: "And on the day when the heaven bursts apart with clouds, and 
the angels are sent down, as they are sent". The rainfall brought many advantages 
to the Muslims, for which see the next footnote. 

c (11-2) Before the rain fell the Muslim position was very weak. The enemy 
had the command of the water and the Muslims were in a low and sandy place. 
Therefore there were some who had misgivings, which, as is said here, were due 
to the devil's uncleanness. The enemy having taken possession of the drinking- 
water, the Muslims feared being troubled by thirst, which is called the devil of the 
desert. The rain strengthened the position of the Muslims and consequently com- 
forted their hearts. This was a purification, for after the rainfall they all became 
certain of Divine help and so of their triumph over the enemy. 

d (12) The two phrases, strike above the necks and strike the finger-tips, 
respectively signify the killing of the enemy and disabling him so as to render him 
unfit for taking further part in fighting. 



8:15' THE BATTLE OF BADR 221 

15 O you who believe, when you meet those who disbelieve 
marching for war, do not turn your backs to them. 16 And whoever 
turns his back to them on that day — unless manoeuvring for 
battle or turning to join a company — he indeed incurs Allah's 
wrath and his refuge is hell. And an evil destination it is. 17 So you 
did not kill them but Allah killed them, and you (O Prophet) did 
not strike when you struck (the enemy), but Allah struck (him), a 
and that He might confer upon the believers a benefit from 
Himself. Surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 18 This c — and 
(know) that Allah will weaken the struggle of the disbelievers. 
19 If you sought a judgment, the judgment has indeed come to you; 
and if you cease (fighting), it is better for you. And if you return 
(to fighting), We (too) shall return and your forces will not avail 
you at all, though they may be many; and (know) that Allah is 
with the believers. 

Section 3: The Way to Success 

20 O you who believe, obey Allah and His Messenger and do 
not turn away from Him while you hear. 21 And do not be like 
those who say, We hear; and they do not hear. 22 Surely the vilest 
of beasts, in Allah's sight, are the deaf, the dumb, who do 



a (17-1) Rama carries a number of significances, including throwing, fling- 
ing, assailing and striking. It is used in connection with fighting, and therefore 
striking is its equivalent here. The first part of the verse about killing refers to the 
Muslims generally, the address being in the plural; and the second part, being in 
the singular, is understood as referring to the Holy Prophet. The Muslims killed 
the enemy, but it is affirmed that really they did not kill, but it was Allah Who 
killed them; the meaning apparently being that Allah's hand was working in the 
battle. The same applies to the other passage relating to the striking of the enemy 
by the Holy Prophet. Whether the Prophet actually threw a handful of pebbles at 
the enemy, which discomfited the latter, is a different question. It was Allah's 
hand that killed them, and it was His hand that struck them and ultimately put 
them to rout. 

b (17-2) The benefit spoken of here is a victory which strengthened the 
foundations of Islam, and dealt a death-blow to the evil designs of those who were 
determined to exterminate it, as is plainly stated in the next verse. 

c (18) This here stands for: this was the Divine purpose in bringing about 
this encounter.

not understand." 23 And if Allah had known any good in them, He 
would have made them hear. And if He makes them hear, they 
would turn away while they are averse. 

24 O you who believe, respond to Allah and His Messenger, 
when he calls you to that which gives you life. ' And know that 
Allah comes in between a man and his heart,' and that to Him you 
will be gathered. 25 And guard yourselves against an affliction 
which may not strike those of you exclusively who are wrong- 
doers; and know that Allah is Severe in retribution. 

26 And remember when you were few, considered weak in 
the land, fearing if people should carry you off by force, He shel- 
tered you and strengthened you with His help, and gave you good 
things that you might give thanks. 27 you who believe, do not be 
unfaithful to Allah and the Messenger, nor be unfaithful to your 
trusts, while you know. 28 And know that your wealth and your 
children are a temptation, and that Allah is He with Whom there is 
a mighty reward. 

Section 4: Muslims to be Guardians of the Sacred Mosque 

29 O you who believe, if you keep your duty to Allah, He will 
grant you a distinction and do away with your evils and protect 
you. And Allah is the Lord of mighty grace. 30 And when those 



a (22) The deaf and the dumb signify those who are spiritually deaf and 
dumb — those who do not understand. 

b (24-1) Faith or submission to Allah is life, and disbelief is death. By the 
expression that which gives you life some understand the Quran, others take it to 
meanjihad, or exertion in the cause of truth. Evidently it is faith. 

c (24-2) By heart is meant the desires of the heart. The Divine intervention 
is the cutting off of those desires. The faithful are enjoined to be quick in respond- 
ing to the call of the Holy Prophet, and not to indulge in worldly desires, for these 
may soon be cut off. Or, the meaning is that they must respond to the call of the 
Holy Prophet in case, having deprived themselves of one occasion of doing good, 
the heart should be hardened, and, as a punishment for the first rejection, Allah 
may so turn it that it may not turn to good at all. 

d (25) This refers to afflictions that are of such a widespread nature as to 
overtake even others, in addition to those for whom they are primarily intended. 



8:31' GUARDIANS OF THE SACRED MOSQUE 223 

who disbelieved devised plans against you that they might confine 
you or kill you or drive you away — and they devised plans and 
Allah, too, had arranged a plan; and Allah is the Best of planners. " 
31 And when Our messages are recited to them, they say: We have 
heard. If we wished, we could say the like of it; this is nothing but 
the stories of the ancients. 

32 And when they said: O Allah, if this is indeed the truth 
from You, then rain down on us stones from heaven or inflict on 
us a painful punishment. 33 And Allah would not punish them 
while you were among them; nor would Allah punish them while 
they seek forgiveness. e 34 And what excuse have they that Allah 
should not punish them while they hinder (people) from the 
Sacred Mosque and they are not its (true) guardians? Its guardians 
are only those who keep their duty, but most of them do not 
know.^ 35 And their prayer at the House is nothing but whistling 
and clapping of hands. 2 Taste, then, the punishment, because you 
disbelieved. 

36 Surely those who disbelieve spend their wealth to hinder 
(people) from the way of Allah. So they will go on spending it, 
then it will be to them a regret, then they will be overcome. And 
those who disbelieve will be gathered together to hell, 37 that Allah 



a (30) The reference is to the final plans of the Quraish when, the Com- 
panions having emigrated to Madinah, the Prophet was left alone at Makkah. The 
Divine plan was that the disbelievers should see the downfall of their power at the 
hands of the Prophet. 

b (31) That this was an empty boast is confirmed by the fact that, although 
the Quran repeatedly challenged them to produce anything like it, they could not 
produce even the like of its shortest chapter. 

c (33) The punishment was to overtake them when the Holy Prophet was no 
more among them, i.e. after his flight from Makkah. But even then the punish- 
ment might be averted if they asked for forgiveness. 

d (34) The words contain a prophecy not only as to the deprivation of the 
disbelieving Quraish of the guardianship of the Ka'bah, but also as to the passing 
of the guardianship into the hands of the Muslims. 

e (35) In fact the House was not used by them for offering prayers to God 
but for sacrilegious talk and gossiping.

may separate the wicked from the good, and put the wicked upon 
one another, then heap them together, then cast them into hell. 
These indeed are the losers. 

Section 5: Badr as Sign of the Prophet's Truth 

38 Say to those who disbelieve, if they cease (fighting), what 
is past will be forgiven them; and if they return (to it), then the 
example of those of old has already gone." 39 And fight with them 
until there is no more persecution, and all religions are for Allah. 
But if they cease, then surely Allah is Seer of what they do. 
40 And if they turn back, then know that Allah is your Patron. Most 
excellent the Patron and most excellent the Helper! 

41 And know that whatever you acquire in war, a fifth of it is 
for Allah and for the Messenger and for the near of kin and the 
orphans and the needy and the traveller/ if you believe in Allah 



a (38) They had gone away from Badr quite discomfited, and they were told 
that, if they ceased fighting, they would be forgiven. Otherwise, they could read 
their own doom in the doom of those with whom Allah had dealt previously in 
similar circumstances. 

b (39) That is, if they cease fighting and put an end to their mischief, God's 
decree of punishment will not be executed. The state of religious liberty which 
Islam aimed at is put tersely in the two opening statements — there is no more 
persecution and all religions are for Allah, everyone being at liberty to hold any 
belief he likes. 

c (41-1) The one-fifth spoken of here is to be divided again into five parts, 
the Prophet, the near of kin, the orphans, the poor, and the traveller being equal 
sharers. The near of kin included all individuals belonging to the tribes of Bani 
Hashim and Bani Abdul Muttalib, to whom zakat money was not allowed. The 
poor among them were thus paid from this source of income. As to the Holy 
Prophet's twenty-fifth, it was also used for the benefit of the Muslims. The re- 
maining four-fifths of the acquisitions were divided among those who took part in 
the battle, as they were not otherwise paid for their services, but there is no order 
to this effect in the Quran itself. This arrangement was simply an exigency. War 
was forced on Muslims all of a sudden when the State had not yet been properly 
formed; there was no army at all, nor a treasury from which to pay it; and just as 
they were required to carry on war on the basis of voluntary gifts, so they were 
allowed a share in the war acquisitions. If the State pays its soldiers as it pays its 
civil servants, the war acquisitions would all go to the State treasury. 



8 : 42 • BADR AS SIGN OF THE PROPHET'S TRUTH 225 

and in what We revealed to Our servant, on the day of Distinction, 
the day on which the two forces met." And Allah is Powerful over 
all things. 

42 When you were on the nearer side (of the valley) and they 
were on the farther side, while the caravan was in a lower place 
than you. And if you had tried to make a mutual appointment, you 
would certainly have broken away from the appointment, but c — 
in order that Allah might bring about a matter which had to be 
done; that he who perished by clear argument might perish, and 
he who lived by clear argument might live. 6 And surely Allah is 
Hearing, Knowing: 43 When Allah showed them to you in jour 
dream as few ' — and if He had shown them to you as many, you 
(O Muslims) would certainly have become weak-hearted and you 
would have disputed about the matter, but Allah saved (you). 
Surely He is Knower of what is in the hearts. 44 And when He 
showed them to you, when you met, as few in your eyes, and He 
made you to appear few in their eyes, in order that Allah might 
bring about a matter which had to be done. g And to Allah are all 
affairs returned. 



a (41-2) The day of Distinction (yaum al-furqan) referred to here is the 
battle of Badr. 

b (42-1) The Muslims were on the side nearer to Madinah, the main army of 
the Quraish was on the side which was farther from Madinah, while the caravan 
was in a lower place, i.e. towards the sea-coast, and farther away from Madinah, 
on its way to Makkah. 

c (42-2) There is a break here, the meaning being but an encounter was 
brought about without an appointment. The Muslims were so weak that they 
could not think of making an appointment with the enemy — they would have 
broken away from the appointment. 

d (42-3) The matter referred to is the defeat of the opponents of Islam. 

e (42-4) The disbelievers had seen clear arguments of the Holy Prophet's 
truth, yet they rejected him and had thus perished in a spiritual sense; they were 
now vanquished in the battle and thus perished temporally. 

/(43) The Holy Prophet's seeing them few in a vision must be interpreted as 
signifying their actual weakness, despite their great number. 

g (44) Here we are told that they were also shown to be few to the Muslims 
when the two armies met. See 3:13 and footnote.

Section 6: Success does not depend on Numbers 

45 O you who believe, when you meet an army, be firm, and 
remember Allah much, that you may be successful. 46 And obey 
Allah and His Messenger and do not dispute with one another so 
that you get weak-hearted and your power departs; and be stead- 
fast. Surely Allah is with the steadfast. 

47 And do not be like those who came forth from their homes 
exultingly and to be seen by people, and they hinder (people) from 
the way of Allah." And Allah encompasses what they do. 48 And 
when the devil made their works seem good to them, and said: No 
man can overcome you this day, and I am your protector. But 
when the two armies came in sight of one another, he turned upon 
his heels, and said: Surely I am clear of you, I see what you do not 
see; surely I fear Allah. And Allah is Severe in retribution. 

Section 7: Enemy's Strength weakened 

49 And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a 
disease said: Their religion has deluded them. And whoever trusts 
in Allah, then surely Allah is Mighty, Wise. 50 And if you could 
see when the angels cause to die those who disbelieve, striking 
their faces and their backs, and (saying): Taste the punishment of 
burning. 51 This is for what your hands have sent ahead, and 
because Allah is not in the least unjust to the servants — 52 in the 
manner of the people of Pharaoh and those before them, they 
disbelieved in Allah's messages, so Allah punished them for their 
sins. Surely Allah is Strong, Severe in retribution. 53 This is because 
Allah never changes a favour which He has conferred upon a 
people until they change their own condition — and because Allah 
is Hearing, Knowing — 54 in the manner of the people of Pharaoh, 
and those before them. They rejected the messages of their Lord, 



a (47) This clearly refers to the army of the Quraish which had marched 
forth in great exultation to destroy Madinah. 

b (48) The person referred to here as the devil is said to have been Suraqa 
ibn Malik who gave the Quraish promise of help. However, what is stated here 
may only be the devil's suggestion to the Quraish leaders. 



8:55' PEACE TO BE SECURED BY STRENGTH 227 

so We destroyed them for their sins. And We drowned Pharaoh's 
people and they were all wrongdoers. 

55 Surely the vilest of beasts in Allah's sight are those who 
disbelieve, then they would not believe — 56 those with whom you 
make an agreement, then they break their agreement every time, 
and they do not keep their duty." 57 So if &gt;&gt;ou overtake them in war, 
scatter by them those who are behind them, that they may be mind- 
ful. 58 And if you fear treachery on the part of a people, throw 
back to them (their treaty) on terms of equality. Surely Allah does 
not love the treacherous. c 

Section 8: Peace to be secured by Strength 

59 And those who disbelieve should not think that they can 
outstrip (Us). Surely they cannot escape. 60 And make ready for 
them whatever force you can and horses tied at the frontier, to 
frighten thereby the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others 
besides them, whom you do not know — Allah knows them. And 
whatever you spend in Allah's way, it will be paid back to you 
fully and you will not be wronged. 



a (56) It shows how the opponents of Islam disregarded their responsibility 
and violated their agreements. The use of the words every time shows clearly that 
the Muslims never hesitated in making a new agreement when one was violated, 
but the disbelievers did not even then respect their agreements; hence, as a last 
resort, Muslims were allowed to repudiate unrespected agreements (v. 58). 

b (57) That is, an exemplary punishment should be inflicted on them, so that 
a stop might be put to further fighting and bloodshed. 

c (58) If the other party does not remain faithful to the agreement of peace, 
Muslims may also repudiate it. The word fear does not indicate that a mere appre- 
hension, unsupported by any action on the other side's part, is sufficient for 
repudiation. Read it along with v. 62, and the meaning is clear. 

d (60) Muslims had won a victory at Badr, though they were not even well- 
equipped and had made no preparation for the war. But they are told that they 
must in future keep themselves well prepared and avail themselves of all sources 
of strength, so that the enemy should by their very preparedness assume a peace- 
ful attitude. It was evident that the weakness of the Muslims was a temptation for 
their opponents to attack them. 



228 8. VOLUNTARY GIFTS • 8 : 61 

61 And if they incline to peace, you (must) incline to it also, 
and trust in Allah. Surely He is the Hearer, the Knower. 62 And if 
they intend to deceive you, then surely Allah is sufficient for you." 
He it is Who strengthened you with His help and with the belie- 
vers, 63 and He has united their hearts. If you had spent all that is in 
the earth, you could not have united their hearts, but Allah united 
them. Surely He is Mighty, Wise. 64 Prophet, Allah is sufficient 
for you and those who follow you from the believers. 

Section 9: Muslims to meet Overwhelming Numbers 

65 O Prophet, urge the believers to fight. If there are of you 
twenty steadfast, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there 
are of you a hundred, they shall overcome a thousand of those 
who disbelieve, because they are a people who do not understand^ 
66 Now Allah has lightened your burden and He knows that there is 
weakness in you. So if there are of you a hundred steadfast, they 
shall overcome two hundred; and if there are of you a thousand, 
they shall overcome two thousand by Allah's permission. And 
Allah is with the steadfast. 



a (62) The deceit is in relation to what has been said in the previous verse, 
the meaning being that ;/ they intend to deceive you under the cloak of peace, 
even in such a case peace is to be accepted. 

b (65-1) It should be noted that the war to which Muslims were to be urged 
was the defensive war which they had to fight to save themselves and to protect the 
religion of Islam. The sword had been taken up against them; see 2:190, 2:217, 
22:39, etc. 

c (65-2) There is a clear prophecy here that, despite their fewer numbers, 
Muslims shall be victorious. After the battle of Badr came the battle of Uhud, in 
which Muslims were less than 1 to 4 against the enemy; this was followed by the 
battle of the Ahzab, in which they were 1 to 10, yet the enemy was routed. 

d (66) The statements in verses 65 and 66 relate to two different states of the 
Muslims. At the time of the battle of Badr there was no Muslim army in exis- 
tence. They had very few arms, and they had never been trained. This is referred 
to in the words: He knows that there is weakness in you. So the Muslim forces as 
then constituted could at most be a match for double their numbers. But a time did 
come when they were a match for ten times their numbers. So both the statements 
in the Quran proved true. 



8 : 67 • RELATIONS OF MUSLIM STATE WITH OTHERS 229 

67 It is not fit for a prophet to take captives unless he has 
fought and triumphed in the land. You desire the frail goods of 
this world, while Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter." And Allah 
is Mighty, Wise. 68 If an ordinance from Allah had not gone before, 
surely a great punishment would have befallen you for what you 
were going to do. 69 Eat then of the lawful and good (things) which 
you have acquired in war, and keep your duty to Allah. Surely 
Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

Section 10: Relations of Muslim State with Others 

70 O Prophet, say to those of the captives who are in your 
hands: If Allah knows anything good in your hearts, He will give 
you better than what has been taken from you, and will forgive 
you. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 71 And if they intend to be 
treacherous to you, so indeed they have been treacherous to Allah 
before, but He gave (you) mastery over them. And Allah is Know- 
ing, Wise. 

72 Surely those who believed and fled (their homes) and 
struggled hard in Allah's way with their wealth and their lives, 
and those who gave shelter and helped — these are friends of 



a (67) The commentators are of opinion that this verse and the next refer to 
releasing the prisoners of war taken at Badr after taking ransom from them, which 
act, it is said, is here disapproved. But various considerations show that these 
verses refer to some other incidents. The reference is to the desire — not to an 
action already completed — of a party of the Muslims referred to in v. 7, and you 
loved that the one not armed should be yours. Some Muslims desired to attack 
and capture the unarmed caravan, but depredations like these, though committed 
by disbelievers upon Muslims, were not fit for a prophet. He must fight a hard 
fight in his defence first and then, if he overcomes the enemy, he may take pri- 
soners. Thus this injunction also declares slavery to be illegal, and allows only the 
retaining of those who are taken prisoners in war. The frail goods of this world 
appropriately refer to the caravan and its merchandise, while the addition of the 
concluding words in v. 69, eat then of the lawful and good things which you have 
acquired in war, shows that the ransom received on account of the prisoners is 
among the lawful and good things. 

b (68) That ordinance from Allah was to bring about an encounter with the 
main army of the Quraish at Badr. It is referred to in v. 7 and v. 42. 



230 8. VOLUNTARY GIFTS • 8 : 73 

one another. And those who believed and did not flee, you are not 
responsible for their protection until they flee. And if they seek 
help from you in the matter of religion, it is your duty to help (them) 
except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty ." 
And Allah is Seer of what you do. 73 And those who disbelieve are 
friends of one another. If you do not do it, there will be persecu- 
tion in the land and great mischief. 74 And those who believed 
and fled and struggled hard in Allah's way, and those who gave 
shelter and helped — these are the believers truly. For them is 
forgiveness and an honourable provision. 75 And those who believed 
afterwards and fled and struggled hard along with you, they are of 
you. And the relatives are nearer to one another in the ordinance 
of Allah. c Surely Allah is Knower of all things. 



a (72) Those who believed, and, having been persecuted, fled from their 
homes, i.e. the Muhajirin, formed a community at Madinah along with those who 
gave them shelter and helped them, i.e. the Ansar. But there were those who chose 
to remain in their homes. The Muslim community at Madinah could not undertake 
to guard the interests of such persons, and this is what is meant by saying, you are 
not responsible for their protection. But if they seek help in the matter of religion, 
it is incumbent on the Muslim community to give them help, unless there exists a 
treaty of alliance with the people against whom such help is sought. 

b (73) If you do not help your brethren in the matter of religion, the dis- 
believers will become more daring in their persecutions and in causing mischief 
and disorder in the land. 

c (75) When even strangers who have accepted Islam and fled from their 
homes become "of you", those who have in addition ties of relationship, possess 
every title to have their interests guarded by the Muslim community. 



Chapter 9 
Ai-Bara'at Immunity 

The name of this chapter (which is also called A l-Taubah or Repentance) refers 
to the declaration in its opening verses that Muslims were now not subject to 
their agreements with certain idolatrous Arab tribes who had been constantly 
breaking them (verses 7-13). The chapter thus first deals with the subject of 
agreements with them as depending on their adherence to them, and goes on 
to prophesy the triumph of Islam in Arabia and later in the world. It then refers 
to the expedition to Tabuk by Muslims undertaken at great sacrifice, and 
deals with the subject of those who excused themselves and the hypocrites. 
At the end, Muslims are reminded of the importance of the propagation of 
Islam and contributing towards it, which was the real object of Islam. This 
chapter was revealed in 9 A.H. This is the only chapter of the Quran not 
opening with Bismillah, "In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful", 
as it is, in a sense, a continuation of the last chapter. 



Section 1: Declaration of Immunity 

1 A declaration of immunity from Allah and His Messenger to 
those of the idolaters with whom you made an agreement." 2 So go 
about in the land for four months and know that you cannot escape 
Allah and that Allah will disgrace the disbelievers. 3 And an 
announcement from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the 
day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah is free from liability to the 
idolaters, and so is His Messenger. So if you repent, it will be 



a (1) This is a declaration of immunity from obligations with such of the 
idolatrous tribes of Arabia as had repeatedly broken their agreements with the 
Muslims. They broke their agreements again and again (8:56), yet the Muslims 
were enjoined to accept peace if the disbelievers consented to it, even after repea- 
ted violations (8:61). But this state of things could not continue long, for it was 
soon found that it was impossible to trust such neighbours. This repudiation of 
agreements took place on a large scale when the Muslims were absent on the 
Tabuk expedition. 

b (3) The first thirteen verses of this chapter were publicly proclaimed by Ali 
on the occasion of the pilgrimage in 9 A.H.

better for you; and if you turn away, then know that you will not 
escape Allah. And announce painful punishment to those who 
disbelieve — 4 except those of the idolaters with whom you made 
an agreement, then they have not failed you in anything and have 
not backed up anyone against you; so fulfil their agreement to the 
end of their term. Surely Allah loves those who keep their duty." 

5 So when the sacred months have passed, kill the idolaters, 
wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them 
and lie in wait for them in every ambush.* But if they repent and 
keep up prayer and give the due charity, leave their way free. c 
Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 6 And if anyone of the idola- 
ters seek your protection, protect him till he hears the word of 
Allah, then convey him to his place of safety. This is because they 
are a people who do not know.^ 



a (4) The exception given here makes it clear that the Muslims were not 
fighting with the idolaters on account of their religion, but on account of their 
having been untrue to their agreements. 

b (5-1) The clear exception of the last verse shows that by the idolaters here 
are meant, not all idolaters or polytheists wherever they may be found in the world, 
not even all idolaters of Arabia, but only those idolatrous tribes of Arabia assem- 
bled at the pilgrimage who had first made agreements with the Muslims and then 
violated them. The order to kill them and to make them prisoners and to besiege 
them and ambush them amounts clearly to an order to fight against them, as it is 
in war only that all these actions are made lawful. (Editor's Note: The expression 
"kill them wherever you find them" has also been used in 2:190-191, where it is 
also declared clearly: "And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against 
you but do not be aggressive". Thus "wherever you find them" means wherever 
you find those who are engaged in fighting against you, after they have been the 
first to attack you.) 

c (5-2) The whole verse relates to certain idolatrous Arab tribes who had 
broken their engagements with the Muslims, and who had now been apprised of a 
similar repudiation by the Muslims. They had so often broken their word that they 
could no more be trusted. Yet, if they joined the brotherhood of Islam, and there 
was an absolute change in their condition, the punishment which they otherwise 
deserved could be remitted. It was a case of forgiving a guilty people who had 
repented. Nothing could be further from the truth than the allegation that this 
offers to the disbelievers the alternative of either being killed or accepting Islam. 

d (6) This verse leaves no doubt that the Holy Prophet was never ordered by 
God to kill anyone on account of his religion. Any idolater seeking the protection 



9:7* REASONS FOR THE IMMUNITY 233 

Section 2: Reasons for the Immunity 

7 How can there be an agreement for the idolaters with Allah 
and with His Messenger, except those with whom you made an 
agreement at the Sacred Mosque? So as long as they are true to 
you, be true to them. Surely Allah loves those who keep their duty. a 
8 How (can it be)? And if they prevail against you, they respect 
neither ties of relationship nor covenant in your case. They would 
please you with their mouths while their hearts refuse; and most of 
them are transgressors. 

9 They have taken a small price for the messages of Allah, so 
they hinder (people) from His way. Surely evil is what they do. 
10 They respect neither ties of relationship nor covenant in the case 
of a believer. And these are they who go beyond the limits. n But 
if they repent and keep up prayer and give the due charity, they 
are your brethren in faith. And We make the messages clear for a 
people who know. 12 And if they break their oaths after their 
agreement and revile your religion, then fight the leaders of 
disbelief — surely their oaths are nothing — so that they may 
ceased 

13 Will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and 
aimed at the expulsion of the Messenger, and they attacked you 
first? Do you fear them? But Allah has more right that you should 
fear Him, if you are believers. 14 Fight them; Allah will punish 

of the Muslims in order to learn about Islam was to be granted safe conduct to 
return home in case he did not think it fit to embrace Islam. 

a (7) So long as the idolaters were true to their agreements, Muslims were 
required to be true to them. Just as in the case of war, Muslims were not allowed 
to fight until the enemy had first attacked, so, in the case of repudiation of agree- 
ments, it was the enemy who first repudiated the agreement. 

b (10) Note the repeated assertions of the Quran that the disbelievers were 
not to be fought against for their disbelief but for their being first in starting war 
or repudiating agreements. 

c (12) Those leaders of disbelief are to be fought against who break their 
oaths after their agreements. 

d (13) Editor's Note: This again makes clear that Muslims are only required 
to fight those who attacked them first.

them at your hands and bring them to disgrace, and assist you 
against them and relieve the hearts of a believing people, 15 and 
remove the rage of their hearts. And Allah turns (mercifully) to 
whom He pleases. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. 16 Do you think 
that you would be left alone while Allah has not yet known those 
of you who struggle hard and do not take anyone as an intimate 
friend besides Allah and His Messenger and the believers? And 
Allah is Aware of what you do. 

Section 3: Idolaters' Service of the Sacred House 

17 The idolaters have no right to maintain the mosques of 
Allah, while bearing witness to disbelief against themselves. 
These it is whose deeds are fruitless; and in the Fire will they 
abide. 18 Only he can maintain the mosques of Allah who believes 
in Allah and the Last Day, and keeps up prayer and gives the due 
charity and fears none but Allah. So these it is who may be of the 
guided ones. 19 Do you hold the giving of drink to the pilgrims and 
the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque equal to (the service of) 
one who believes in Allah and the Last Day and strives hard in 
Allah's way? They are not equal in the sight of Allah. And Allah 
does not guide the wrongdoing people. 20 Those who believed and 
fled (their homes), and strove hard in Allah's way with their 
wealth and their lives, are much higher in rank with Allah. And it 
is these that shall triumph. 21 Their Lord gives them good news of 
mercy and pleasure, from Himself, and Gardens in which lasting 
blessings will be theirs, 22 abiding in them forever. Surely Allah 
has a mighty reward with Him. 

23 O you who believe, do not take your fathers and your 
brothers for friends if they love disbelief above faith. And who- 



a (17) By the mosques of Allah is meant particularly the Sacred Mosque at 
Makkah, as being the centre of all the mosques of the world. This is made clear in 
v. 19. It had long remained in the hands of the idolaters, who visited and repaired 
it, having placed a large number of idols within it. With the conquest of Makkah 
the Sacred Mosque was denuded of all idols, and was now as pure an emblem of 
monotheism as in the time of Abraham. Hence the idol-worshippers had nothing 
to do with it now.

ever of you takes them for friends, such are the wrongdoers. 
24 Say: If your fathers and your sons and your brethren and your 
wives and your kinsfolk and the wealth you have acquired, and 
trade whose dullness you fear, and dwellings you love, are dearer 
to you than Allah and His Messenger and striving in His way, then 
wait till Allah brings His command to pass. And Allah does not 
guide the transgressing people." 

Section 4: Islam made Triumphant in Arabia 

25 Certainly Allah helped you in many battlefields, and on the 
day of Hunain, when your great numbers made you proud, but 
they availed you nothing, and the earth with all its vastness was 
narrowed for you, then you turned back retreating. 26 Then Allah 
sent down His calm upon His Messenger and upon the believers, 
and sent armies which you did not see, and punished those who 
disbelieved. And such is the reward of the disbelievers. 27 Then 
will Allah, after this, turn mercifully to whom He pleases. And 
Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

28 O you who believe, the idolaters are surely unclean, c so 



a (24) A true Muslim may have wealth, may carry on trade, may have mag- 
nificent houses, but these should not be dearer to him than Allah and exertion in 
His path. He should be ready to sacrifice all these interests for a higher purpose, 
before which all these sink into insignificance. The Quran does not require one 
actually to hate riches, but rather not to be obsessed by wealth to the neglect of 
one's higher duties. The acquisition of wealth is not harmful so long as it is not 
made the real aim of life, but has its proper place as the means to an end. 

b (25) The battle of Hunain, fought in 8 A.H. in the valley of Hunain, about 
three miles from Makkah, differed from the other battles in that the Muslims here 
outnumbered the enemy. However, the archers of the enemy were good marks- 
men, and had occupied strong positions in the mountain passes. The Muslim army 
contained some men from Makkah still adhering to idolatry. Unfortunately this 
was the advance party of the army, and, unable to face the archers, they retreated 
causing disorder to the whole army. The Holy Prophet, however, led the assault, 
at first alone, in face of the archers, but was soon joined by others and a victory 
was obtained, as the next verse shows. 

c (28-1) Because they indulged in evil practices and went naked round the 
Ka'bah. Compare 5:90, where idols are declared to be unclean.

And if you fear poverty, then Allah will enrich you out of His 
grace, if He please. Surely Allah is Knowing, Wise. 29 Fight those 
who do not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid what 
Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, nor follow the Religion 
of Truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they

state of subjection/ 



a (28-2) The year of the proclamation, i.e. 9 A.H. 

b (28-3) The importance of Makkah as a commercial centre lay in the fact 
that the whole of Arabia repaired to it in the season of the pilgrimage, and there 
carried out important commercial transactions. The prohibition referred to in the 
first part of the verse could have been easily foreseen as affecting the commerce, 
and consequently the prosperity of Makkah, but worldly or business considera- 
tions never interfered with the carrying out of the moral reforms of Islam. 

c (29) The great Christian power, the Roman Empire, had just mobilized its 
forces for the subjection of the new religion, and the Tabflk expedition took place, 
which is dealt with further on in this chapter. As the object of this Christian power 
was simply the subjection of the Muslims, their final defeat by the Muslims is 
spoken of as subjection. It was not in any way the object of the Quran to bring the 
Christians into subjection. On the other hand, the Christians first moved them- 
selves to bring Muslim Arabia under subjection. Tbsjizyah or tax spoken of here 
is, according to Lane's Lexicon, the tax that is taken from the free non-Muslim 
subjects of the Muslim Government whereby they ratify the compact that ensures 
them protection. 

The permission to fight given to Muslims is subject to the condition that the 
enemy should first take up the sword (2:190). The Holy Prophet never over- 
stepped this limit, nor did his followers. He fought against the Arabs when they 
took up the sword to destroy the Muslims, and he led an expedition against the 
Christians when the Roman Empire first mobilized its forces with the object of 
subjugating the Muslims. When he found that the enemy had not yet taken the ini- 
tiative, he did not attack the Roman Empire, but returned without fighting. Later 
on, however, the Roman Empire, like the Persians, fomented trouble against the 
newly established Muslim Kingdom, as a result of which both these empires came 
into conflict with the Muslims and, despite the fact that both the Persians and the 
Romans were very powerful nations with unlimited resources and strong military 
organizations, and that they both tried at the same time to subjugate Islam, the 
result was what is predicted here in clear words — they were both reduced to a 
state of subjection by an insignificant nation like the Arabs. 



9 : 30 • ISLAM WILL TRIUMPH IN THE WORLD 237 

Section 5: Islam will triumph in the World 

30 And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; a and the Chris- 
tians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah. These are the words of 
their mouths. They imitate the saying of those who disbelieved 
before. Allah's curse be on them! How they are turned away 
(from truth)! 31 They take their doctors of law and their monks for 
lords besides Allah/ and (also) the Messiah, son of Mary. And 
they were enjoined that they should serve one God only — there is 
no god but He. Glory be to Him from what they set up as partners 
(with Him)! 

32 They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths, 
but Allah will allow nothing except the perfection of His light, 
though the disbelievers are averse/ 33 He it is Who has sent His 
Messenger with the guidance and the Religion of Truth that He 
may make it prevail over all religions, though those who set up 
partners (with Allah) are averse. e 



a (30-1) It has been shown by Muslim historians that there was a sect among 
the Jews who raised Ezra to the dignity of godhead or son of God. The Quran 
never blames the Jewish nation as a whole for entertaining this belief. However, 
the word son in case of Ezra may have been used here freely as meaning a special 
favourite, in the same way as elsewhere the Quran says of the Jews and the Chris- 
tians that they call themselves the sons of Allah and His beloved ones (5:18). 

b (30-2) We are here told that the Christian doctrine that Jesus Christ was the 
son of God was borrowed from earlier pagan people. Recent research has estab- 
lished the fact beyond all doubt. In fact, when St. Paul saw that the Jews would on 
no account accept Jesus Christ as a messenger of God, he introduced the pagan 
doctrine of sonship of God into the Christian religion, so that it might become 
more acceptable to the pagans. 

c (31) This does not mean that they took them actually for gods; the meaning 
is that they followed them blindly in what they enjoined and what they forbade, 
attaching to them a Divine dignity. Muslims who accord a similar position to their 
ulama, spiritual leaders or saints are guilty of the same error. 

d (32) This is a prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Islam in face of severe 
opposition. All opposition to truth, whether based on force or propaganda, is here 
compared with putting out the Divine light by blowing with the mouth to show 
that all such attempts would prove futile. The Divine light will be made perfect, 
by which is meant the triumph of Islam, as the next verse states clearly. 

e (33) The prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Islam in the whole world is

34 O you who believe, surely many of the doctors of law and 
monks eat away people's property falsely, and hinder (them) from 
Allah's way. And those who hoard up gold and silver and do not 
spend it in Allah's way — announce to them a painful punishment, 
3s on the day when it will be heated in the Fire of hell, then their 
foreheads and their sides and their backs will be branded with it: 
This is what you hoarded up for yourselves, so taste what you 
used to hoard." 

36 Surely the number of months with Allah is twelve months 
by Allah's ordinance, since the day when He created the heavens 
and the earth — of these four are sacred. That is the right religion; 
so do not wrong yourselves in regard to them. And fight the 
idolaters all together as they fight you all together.^ And know that 
Allah is with those who keep their duty. 37 Postponing (of the 
sacred month) is only an addition in disbelief, by which those who 
disbelieve are led astray. They allow it one year and forbid it 
(another) year, that they may agree in the number (of months) 



repeated three times in the Quran, in exactly the same words — here and in 48:28 
and 61:9. In Arabia itself, Islam became triumphant in the lifetime of the Holy 
Prophet. After his death, the first century of the Muslim era saw vast Christian 
communities swelling the ranks of Islam, in Egypt, North Africa, Asia Minor, 
Persia and Central Asia. More amazing was the fact that Islam, coming in contact 
with other great religions, with Zoroastrianism in Persia, with Buddhism and 
Hinduism in India and Afghanistan, and with Confucianism in China, conquered 
the hearts of the followers of every religion and they accepted the message of 
Truth in vast numbers. And the final manifestation of this great prophecy is fore- 
shadowed in the gradual acceptance of the principles of Islam in the whole world 
today, despite the fact that the political power of Islam is at its lowest ebb. 

a (35) The punishment of an evil is spoken of throughout the Quran as simi- 
lar to the evil. Even in this world, a man feels a torment similar to the nature of 
the evil in which he indulges. Being branded with the hoarded wealth is thus a fit 
description of the punishment of the hoarders. 

b (36-1) The allusion here is to the Arab practice of postponing the pilgri- 
mage to a month other than that in which it fell, for which see the next verse. 

c (36-2) Fighting was prohibited in the sacred months (2:217). Excepting 
this, the Muslims were told to fight with the idolaters as the idolaters fought with 
them, i.e. since all idolaters united in fighting with the Muslims, the latter, too, 
should unite in fighting with them. 



9:38' THE TABUK EXPEDITION 239 

which Allah has made sacred, and thus make lawful what Allah 
has forbidden." The evil of their doings is made to seem good to 
them. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people. 

Section 6: The Tabuk Expedition 

38 O you who believe, what (excuse) have you that when it is 
said to you, Go forth in Allah's way, you should incline heavily to 
earth? Are you contented with this world's life instead of the 
Hereafter? The provision of this world's life is but little as com- 
pared with the Hereafter. 39 If you do not go forth, He will punish 
you with a painful punishment, and bring in your place a people 
other than you, and you can do Him no harm. c And Allah is Power- 
ful over all things. 

40 If you do not help him, Allah certainly helped him when 
those who disbelieved expelled him — he being the second of the 
two; when they were both in the cave, when he said to his com- 
panion: Do not grieve, surely Allah is with us. So Allah sent 



a (37) The reference here is to the practice of postponing observance of the 
sacred month, thus allowing an ordinary month to be observed as sacred and a 
sacred month to be treated as ordinary. This practice interfered with the security 
of life which was guaranteed in the sacred months, and is, therefore, denounced. 

b (38) This refers to the expedition of Tabuk, which was undertaken in the 
middle of 9 A.H. owing to the threatening attitude of the Roman Empire. There 
were many hindrances to the raising of an army sufficient to meet the strong 
forces of the Roman Empire, the main ones being: a great drought, the length of 
the journey to Syria, the ripening of the fruits which were now ready to be 
gathered, the heat, and the organization and power of the Roman army. In spite of 
all these difficulties 30,000 men gathered round the Holy Prophet's banner. 

c (39) The reference here and in what follows is to certain men, who, while 
professing belief, hesitated to accept the Holy Prophet's call to get ready for the 
expedition. 

rf(40) This refers to the Holy Prophet's flight from Makkah, when he was 
forced to hide himself in a cave called Thaur, about three miles from Makkah, 
with only one companion, Abu Bakr, "the second of the two". The believers are 
told that Allah saved the Prophet from the hands of his enemies when he had just 
one companion amidst a whole nation of enemies, and that Allah would help him 
now.

down His tranquillity on him and strengthened him with forces 
which you did not see, and made lowest the word of those who 
disbelieved. And the word of Allah, that is the uppermost. And 
Allah is Mighty, Wise. 

41 Go forth, light and heavy," and strive hard in Allah's way 
with your wealth and your lives. This is better for you, if you know. 
42 If it had been a near gain and a short journey, they would cer- 
tainly have followed you, but the hard journey was too long for 
them. And they will swear by Allah: If we had been able, we 
would have gone forth with you. They cause their own souls to 
perish; and Allah knows that they are liars. 

Section 7: The Hypocrites 

43 Allah pardon youf Why did you permit them until those 
who spoke the truth had become apparent to you and you had 
known the liars? 44 Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day 
do not ask permission from you (to stay away) from striving hard 
with their wealth and their persons. And Allah is Knower of those 
who keep their duty. 45 They alone ask permission from you who 
do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and their hearts are in 
doubt, so in their doubt they waver. 46 And if they had intended to 
go forth, they would certainly have provided equipment for it; but 
Allah did not like their going forth. So He withheld them, and it 
was said: Hold back with those who hold back. 47 If they had gone 



a (41) That is, whether it is easy or difficult for you to proceed or whether 
you are sufficiently armed or not. 

b (42) Tabuk was midway between Madinah and Damascus. The Arabs were 
accustomed to fighting near home; hence, the distance was one of the chief consi- 
derations which held back those who were insincere. 

c (43) This expression does not convey the significance of pardon of sins; it 
is rather the equivalent of Allah bless you! or may Allah set your affairs aright! In 
previous battles, too, the hypocrites always stayed away, offering one excuse or 
another. But the Divine purpose in this last expedition of the Holy Prophet was to 
bring about a clear distinction, and to clean the Muslim society of the hypocritical 
element thoroughly. Such a distinction was really brought about later on as verses 
83-84 point out. 



9 : 48 • THE HYPOCRITES 241 

forth with you, they would have added to you nothing but trouble, 
and would have hurried to and fro among you seeking (to sow) 
dissension among you. And among you there are those who would 
listen to them. And Allah well knows the wrongdoers. 48 Certainly 
they sought (to sow) dissension before, and they devised plots 
against you till the Truth came, and Allah's command prevailed, 
though they did not like (it). 

49 And among them is he who says: Excuse me and do not try 
me. Surely into trial have they already fallen, and truly hell en- 
compasses the disbelievers. 50 If good befalls you, it grieves them; 
and if hardship afflicts you, they say: Indeed we had taken care of 
our affair before. And they turn away rejoicing. 51 Say: Nothing 
will afflict us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is our 
Patron; and on Allah let the believers rely. 52 Say: Do you await for 
us but one of two most excellent things? a And we await for you 
that Allah will afflict you with punishment from Himself or by our 
hands. So wait; we too are waiting with you. 

53 Say: Spend willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted 
from you. Surely you are a transgressing people. 54 And nothing 
hinders their contributions being accepted from them, except that 
they disbelieve in Allah and in His Messenger and they do not 
come to prayer except as lazy people, nor do they spend (on good 
works) but reluctantly. 55 Do not, then, let their wealth nor their 
children excite your admiration. Allah only wishes to punish them 
by means of these in this world's life and (that) their souls may 
depart while they are disbelievers. c 56 And they swear by Allah that 



a (52-1) The two most excellent things are: the laying down of life in the 
cause of Truth, or being sharer in the ultimate triumph of Truth. 

b (52-2) The only punishment that the hypocrites received from the hands of 
the Muslims was that they were named and asked to leave the mosque. Otherwise 
their liberty was not interfered with. See also the next verse. 

c (55) The hypocrites experienced earthly torture about their property and 
children for two reasons: (1) because, avowing their belief in Islam, they had to 
take some share in its defensive expeditions and thus spend part of their property, 
unwillingly though it was, in the cause of Islam; (2) the children of many of them 
were true believers, and they knew that after their death their property and their 



242 9. THE IMMUNITY • 9 : 57 

they are truly of you. And they are not of you, but they are a people 
who are afraid. 57 If they could find a refuge or caves or a place to 
enter, they would certainly have turned to it, running away in all 
haste. 

58 And some of them blame you in the matter of the (distribu- 
tion of) charity. So if they are given out of it, they are pleased, and 
if they are not given out of it, lo! they are enraged. 59 And (better it 
would be) if they were content with what Allah and His Messen- 
ger gave them, and had said: Allah is sufficient for us, Allah will 
soon give us (more) out of His grace and His Messenger too — 
surely to Allah we make petition. 

Section 8: The Hypocrites 

60 (The due) charity a is only for the poor and the needy, and 
those employed to administer it, and those whose hearts are made 
to incline (to truth), and (to free) the captives, and those in debt, 
and in the way of Allah and for the traveller — an ordinance from 
Allah. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. 



children were to become a source of strength to the very religion which they tried 
to extirpate. 

a (60-1) The word sadaqat, used here for charity, refers in this verse to the 
obligatory charity called zakat, and not to voluntary alms which is its common 
meaning. This is shown by the concluding words of the verse, which call it an 
ordinance from Allah. 

b (60-2) The verse defines the objects for which the zakat or due charity may 
be spent. Eight heads of expenditure are recognized. There are the poor, or those 
in difficult circumstances. Then there are the needy, by which are meant people 
who need some help to enable them to earn their living; poor students and crafts- 
men or business men without sufficient means are included in this category. 
Thirdly, there are the collectors of zakat and other people employed to administer 
the funds. This shows that the institution was meant for raising a public fund, 
whose management should entirely be in the hands of a public body. In the fourth 
class are people whose hearts are made to incline to Truth — carrying the 
message of Truth to them needs funds, and there are also people who may need 
help if they accept the Truth. The fifth head relates to the freeing of the prisoners 
of war. Islam thus laid down a permanent basis for the abolition of slavery. The 
sixth class is that of debtors — people who incur debts for right purposes. Squan- 
derers of wealth are, however, not included in this category. The seventh head is 



9 : 61 • THE HYPOCRITES 243 

61 And some of them molest the Prophet and say, He is (all) 
ear." Say: A hearer of good for you — he believes in Allah and 
believes the faithful, and is a mercy for those of you who believe. 
And those who molest the Messenger of Allah, for them is a pain- 
ful punishment. 62 They swear by Allah to you to please you; and 
Allah — as well as His Messenger — has a greater right that they 
should please Him, if they are believers. 63 Do they not know that 
whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, for him is the Fire of 
hell to abide in it? That is the grievous disgrace. 

64 The hypocrites fear that a chapter may be sent down con- 
cerning them, telling them plainly of what is in their hearts. Say: 
Go on mocking, surely Allah will bring to light what you fear. 
65 And if you ask them, they would certainly say: We were only 
talking idly and sporting. Say: Was it Allah and His messages and 
His Messenger that you mocked? 66 Make no excuse, you dis- 
believed after your believing. If We pardon some of you, We shall 
punish others because they are guilty. c 

Section 9: The Hypocrites 

67 The hypocrites, men and women, are all alike. They enjoin 
evil and forbid good and withhold their hands. They have forsaken 
Allah, so He has forsaken them. Surely the hypocrites are the 
transgressors. 68 AUah promises the hypocrites, men and women, 
and the disbelievers the Fire of hell to abide in it. It is enough 

in general words "in the way of Allah". This would include those fighting in 
defence of faith and the community, or those engaged in propagating Islamic 
truths, but the words may be taken generally and include every charitable purpose. 
The eighth head is that of travellers, people who are stranded in a country, to what- 
ever religion or nation they may belong. 

a (61) The hypocrites made various derogatory remarks concerning the Holy 
Prophet, saying among other things, that he was a man who believed everything 
that he heard, and they were therefore sure that they would make him believe their 
hypocritical professions. 

b (62) Though Allah and His Messenger are both mentioned together, the 
duty of the faithful is here said to be to please Him, i.e. Allah alone. 

c (66) History shows that most of the hypocrites ultimately repented and 
sincerely joined the ranks of the faithful. 



244 9. THE IMMUNITY • 9 : 69 

for them. And Allah curses them, and for them is a lasting punish- 
ment. 69 Like those before you — they were stronger than you in 
power and had more wealth and children. So they enjoyed their 
portion; thus have you enjoyed your portion as those before you 
enjoyed their portion, and you indulge in idle talk as they did. 
These are they whose deeds are fruitless in this world and the Here- 
after, and these are they who are the losers. 

70 Has not the story reached them of those before them — of 
the people of Noah and Ad and Thamud, and the people of 
Abraham and the dwellers of Midian and the overthrown cities? 
Their messengers came to them with clear arguments. So Allah did 
not wrong them but they wronged themselves. 

71 And the believers, men and women, are friends of one 
another. They enjoin good and forbid evil and keep up prayer and 
give the due charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. As for 
these, Allah will have mercy on them. Surely Allah is Mighty, 
Wise. 72 Allah has promised to the believers, men and women, 
Gardens, in which rivers flow, to abide in them, and goodly dwell- 
ings in Gardens of perpetual abode. And greatest of all is Allah's 
goodly pleasure. That is the mighty achievement. 

Section 10: The Hypocrites 

73 O Prophet, strive hard against the disbelievers and the 
hypocrites and be firm against them." And their abode is hell, and 
evil is the destination. 74 They swear by Allah that they said nothing. 
And certainly they did speak the word of disbelief, and dis- 
believed after their Islam, and they aimed (to do) what they could 



a (73) Jihad signifies striving hard. It is in a secondary sense that the word 
signifies fighting, and it is repeatedly used in the Quran in its primary signifi- 
cance. It is a fact that those who professed Islam insincerely were never fought 
against by the Muslims — as on this occasion and on the occasion of the battle of 
Uhud. The Holy Prophet is commanded here to carry on a jihad against dis- 
believers as well as hypocrites. Hence the only significance that can be attached to 
these words is that he must continue to exert himself hard in preaching both to the 
disbelievers and the hypocrites. 



9 : 75 • THE HYPOCRITES 245 

not attain. And they sought revenge only because Allah — as 
well as His Messenger — had enriched them out of His grace. So 
if they repent, it will be good for them; and if they turn away, 
Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world 
and the Hereafter; and they shall have in the earth neither a friend 
nor a helper. 

75 And some of them made a covenant with Allah: If He give 
us out of His grace, we will certainly give in charity and be of the 
righteous. 76 But when He gave them out of His grace, they 
became miserly with it and they turned away and they are averse. 
77 So He repaid them with hypocrisy in their hearts till the day 
when they meet Him, because they broke their promise with Allah 
and because they lied. 78 Do they not know that Allah knows their 
hidden thoughts and their secret counsels, and that Allah is the 
great Knower of the unseen things? 

79 Those who taunt the free givers of charity among the 
believers as well as those who cannot find anything (to give) but 
with their hard labour — they scoff at them. Allah will pay them 
back their mockery; and for them is a painful punishment/ 80 Ask 
forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them. Even if 
you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive 
them. This is because they disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger. 
And Allah does not guide the transgressing people. 



a (74-1) They did their best to put an end to the life of the Holy Prophet and 
bring about the extirpation of Islam. 

b (74-2) The advent of the Muslims in Madinah had enriched its inhabitants. 
Was it not, then, a matter for wonder that those men who had gained by Islam 
should turn against their very benefactors? 

c (79) When subscriptions were raised for the expedition to Tabuk, the 
wealthier members of the Muslim community gave large donations, while the 
poorer ones, the labourers, also paid their mite out of their hard earnings. The 
hypocrites taunted both, the former as making a show of their wealth, the latter as 
bringing in their small subscriptions only to be counted among the subscribers. 

d (80) Spiritual relations with the hypocrites were henceforth cut off. The 
mention of seventy may not indicate the specific number here. When Abdullah ibn 
Ubayy, the recognized leader of the hypocrites, died, the Holy Prophet was asked 



246 9. THE IMMUNITY • 9 : 81 

Section 1 1 : The Hypocrites 

81 Those who were left behind were glad on account of their 
remaining behind Allah's Messenger, and they disliked to strive in 
Allah's way with their property and their persons, and said: Do 
not go forth in the heat. Say: The Fire of hell is fiercer in heat. If 
only they could understand! 82 Then let them laugh a little and weep 
much — a recompense for what they earned. 83 So if Allah bring 
you back to some of them, then they ask your permission to go 
forth, say: Never shall you go forth with me and never shall you 
fight an enemy with me. You chose to sit (at home) the first time, 
so sit (now) with those who remain behind." 

84 And never offer prayer for anyone of them who dies, nor 
stand by his grave. Surely they disbelieved in Allah and His 
Messenger and they died in transgression. 85 And do not let their 

to conduct the burial service. The Holy Prophet got up, but Umar objected on the 
ground that Abdullah was a hypocrite, and referred to his hostile attitude through- 
out his life. The Holy Prophet replied that Allah had given him a choice (referring 
to the words of this verse: Ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for 
them), and that he would ask forgiveness for him for over seventy times, so that 
forgiveness could be extended to the dead man. Then he offered prayers for him. 
Verse 84 is said to have been revealed then to stop the offering of prayers for those 
who were known to be hypocrites (Bukhari, 23:84). 

The incident shows how kind and forgiving the Holy Prophet was to his 
severest enemies. Abdullah ibn Ubayy was the man who had led the hypocrite 
movement against him, and thus was not only one of his worst enemies, but a 
most dangerous one, because he was aware of all the movements of the Muslims 
and deceived them at the most critical moments. Yet the Holy Prophet forgave 
him entirely. 

a (83) This is the only punishment given to the hypocrites, namely, that they 
were not allowed to take part in future expeditions against the enemies of the 
Muslims. It is also related that from one of them the Holy Prophet and the three 
Caliphs who followed him refused to accept the zakat. These were the only dis- 
advantages, if it is right to call them so, which the hypocrites suffered. They were 
not looked upon as members of the Muslim community, but as citizens they 
enjoyed all the rights of other citizens. 

b (84) The Prophet is now told that, though they professed Islam outwardly, 
they were disbelievers at heart, and the burial service, which was only for Mus- 
lims, should not be extended to them. But it was through Divine revelation that 
the Prophet learnt that they were really disbelievers. It is, further, clear from these

wealth and their children excite jour admiration. Allah only intends 
to punish them thereby in this world, and (that) their souls may 
depart while they are disbelievers. 

86 And when a chapter is revealed, saying, Believe in Allah 
and strive hard along with His Messenger, the wealthy among them 
ask permission of you and say: Leave us (behind), that we may be 
with those who sit (at home). 87 They prefer to be with those who 
remain behind, and their hearts are sealed so they do not under- 
stand. 88 But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive 
hard with their property and their persons. And these it is for whom 
are the good things and these it is who are successful. 89 Allah has 
prepared for them Gardens in which rivers flow, to abide therein. 
That is the mighty achievement. 

Section 12: The Hypocrites 

90 And the defaulters from among the dwellers of the desert 
came that permission might be given to them, and they sat (at 
home) who lied to Allah and His Messenger. A painful punish- 
ment will afflict those of them who disbelieve. 91 No blame lies on 
the weak, nor on the sick, nor on those who can find nothing to 
spend, if they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger. There is no 
way (to blame) against the doers of good. And Allah is Forgiving, 
Merciful — 92 nor on those to whom, when they came to you that 
you should carry them, you said: I cannot find anything on which 
to carry you." They went back, their eyes overflowing with tears 
of grief that they could not find anything to spend. 93 The way (to 
blame) is only against those who ask permission of you, though 
they are rich. They have chosen to be with those who remained 
behind; and Allah has sealed their hearts, so they do not know. 

words that those who were known to be hypocrites were not fought against but 
lived to die a natural death. There is not a single case on record of any one of 
them having been put to death. Standing by the grave refers to the Holy Prophet's 
practice of praying for the deceased standing by his grave after the burial. 

a (92) What they wanted in order to join the expedition, and what the Holy 
Prophet could not find for them, were beasts on which they should be carried, 
along with their provisions and necessaries. See also 19:27 footnote 1.

94 They will make excuses to you when you return to them. 
Say: Make no excuse, we shall not believe you; Allah has informed 
us of matters relating to you. And Allah and His Messenger will 
now see your actions, then you will be brought back to the 
Knower of the unseen and the seen, then He will inform you of 
what you did." 95 They will swear by Allah to you, when you return 
to them, so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone. 
Surely they are unclean and their refuge is hell — a recompense 
for what they earned. 96 They will swear to you that you may be 
pleased with them. But if you are pleased with them, yet surely 
Allah is not pleased with the transgressing people. 

97 The dwellers of the desert are hardest in disbelief and hypo- 
crisy, and most disposed not to know the limits of what Allah has 
revealed to His Messenger. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. 98 And 
some of the dwellers of the desert take what they spend to be a 
fine, e and they wait for an evil turn of fortune for you. On them is 
the evil turn. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. "And some of the 
dwellers of the desert believe in Allah and the Last Day, and 
consider what they spend and the prayers of the Messenger as 
bringing them nearer to Allah. Surely they bring them nearer (to 
Allah); Allah will admit them into His mercy. Surely Allah is 
Forgiving, Merciful. 

Section 13: The Hypocrites 

100 And the foremost, the first of the Emigrants and the Help- 
ers, and those who followed them in goodness — Allah is well 



a (94) Evidently these verses were revealed when the Holy Prophet was 
away from Madinah, and the statements made in them are therefore prophetical, 
being exactly fulfilled on his return. 

b (95) On his return from Tabflk, the Holy Prophet forbade Muslims to have 
any relations with the hypocrites. 

c (98) The hypocrites had to contribute something for the sake of appear- 
ance; they also paid the zakat so that they might be treated as Muslims. 

d (100) In the history of Islam, the word 'Emigrants' (muhajirin) came to 
signify all those Companions of the Holy Prophet who, having embraced Islam at

prepared for them Gardens in which rivers flow, abiding therein 
forever. That is the mighty achievement. 101 And some of the 
dwellers of the desert around you are hypocrites; and some of the 
people of Madinah (also) — they persist in hypocrisy. Fou do not 
know them; We know them. a We will punish them twice, then 
they will be turned back to a severe punishment. 

102 And others have acknowledged their faults — they mixed 
a good deed with another that was evil. It may be that Allah will 
turn to them (mercifully). Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. e 
103 Take charity out of their property — you would cleanse them 
and purify them thereby — and pray for them. Surely your prayer 
is a relief to them. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing/ 104 Do they 
not know that Allah is He Who accepts repentance from His 
servants and takes the charity, and that Allah — He is the Oft- 
returning (to mercy), the Merciful? 105 And say, Work; so Allah 
will see your work and (so will) His Messenger and the believers. 
And you will be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the 
seen, then He will inform you of what you did. 106 And others are 



Makkah, had to flee from their homes either to Abyssinia (present day Ethiopia) 
or to Madinah. The latter flight, including nearly all the Muslims of Makkah, is 
known as the Hijra or Flight, and the Muslim era dates from it. The word 
'Helpers' (Ansar) signifies the Muslims of Madinah who, having accepted Islam 
before the Flight, gave shelter to those who fled from Makkah. By "those who 
followed them in goodness" are meant the Muslims who came after the Com- 
panions and followed their good deeds. 

a (101-1) The insincerity of the heart could not be known to a mortal — it is 
known only to Allah. 

b (101-2) The hypocrites were punished twice in this life. They had to take 
part in all contributions for the defence of the Muslim community and had to pay 
the zakat, all this against their conviction and unwillingly. After having suffered 
all this torment for the sake of being reckoned Muslims, they were ultimately 
separated from the Muslims, and this exposure to public shame was no doubt a 
great punishment for them. 

c (102) According to different reports, the number of these men varied from 
three to ten. They were sincere and acknowledged their fault. 

d (103) Because they showed sincerity in confessing their faults, they were 
dealt with leniently. Their charity was not to be rejected.

made to await Allah's command, whether He will punish them or 
turn to them (mercifully). And Allah is Knowing, Wise." 

107 And those who built a mosque to cause harm (to Islam) 
and (to help) disbelief, and to cause disunion among the believers, 
and a refuge for him who made war against Allah and His Messen- 
ger before. And they will certainly swear: We desired nothing but 
good. And Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars. 108 Never 
stand in it. Certainly a mosque founded on observance of duty from 
the first day is more deserving that you should stand in it. In it are 
men who love to purify themselves. And Allah loves those who 
purify themselves/ 109 Is he, then, who lays his foundation on duty 
to Allah and (His) good pleasure better, or he who lays his founda- 
tion on the edge of a cracking hollowed bank, so it broke down 
with him into the Fire of hell? And Allah does not guide the unjust 
people. 110 The building which they have built will ever continue to 
be a source of disquiet in their hearts, unless their hearts be torn to 
pieces. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. 

Section 14: The Faithful 

111 Surely Allah has bought from the believers their persons 
and their property — theirs (in return) is the Garden. They fight in 
Allah's way, so they kill and are killed. It is a promise which is 



a (106) This is generally supposed to refer to three of the believers who held 
back from the expedition (Bukhari, 64:81). 

b (107) Some hypocrites built a mosque at the instigation of Abu Amir, with 
the object of causing harm to that mosque. Abu Amir, who after fighting against 
the Holy Prophet for a long time, had fled to Syria after the battle of Hunain, had 
written to his friends at Madinah that he was coming with a formidable army to 
crush the Prophet, and that they should build a mosque for him. But Abu Amir 
died in Syria, and the founders desired the Holy Prophet to give it a blessing by 
his presence, which he was forbidden to do by Divine revelation, and the mosque 
was demolished. 

c (108) The words are general and every mosque raised for the service of 
Allah may be included in this description. 

rf(110) Their hearts could be torn to pieces by severe regret or by sincere 
repentance.

binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Quran." And 
who is more faithful to his promise than Allah? Rejoice therefore 
in your bargain which you have made. And that is the mighty 
achievement. 112 They who turn (to Allah), who serve (Him), who 
praise (Him), who fast, who bow down, who prostrate themselves, 
who enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and who keep the 
limits of Allah — and give good news to the believers. 

113 It is not for the Prophet and those who believe to ask for- 
giveness for those who set up partners (with Allah), even though 
they should be near relatives, after it has become clear to them 
that they are companions of the flaming fire. 114 And Abraham's 



a (111) The promise binding on Allah is that Allah will grant the believers 
His blessings, if they exert themselves with their persons and their property in His 
way. The Gospels give the same promise: "If you want to be perfect", said Jesus 
to a wealthy man, "go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have 
treasure in heaven; and come, follow me" (Matthew, 19:21). To Peter he said: 
"everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or 
children or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit 
eternal life" (Matthew, 19:29). Moses' teaching contains similar promises. For 
instance, the promise of "a land flowing with milk and honey" is made condi- 
tional on "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your 
soul, and with all your strength" (Deuteronomy, 6:3-5), which is the same as 
exerting oneself to the utmost in the way of God with one's person and property. 

It should be borne in mind that the words, they fight in Allah 's way, so they 
kill and are killed, are not a part of the promise, but are expressive of the condi- 
tion of the Companions, and show that they were true to their promise. The 
promise to spend one's person and property may be carried out in various ways 
under different circumstances, and the Companions of the Holy Prophet were as 
true to this promise during the thirteen years at Makkah as during the ten years at 
Madinah. 

b (113) This verse does not prohibit praying for the forgiveness of the dis- 
believers in general, but only such disbelievers about whom it became clear that 
they were doomed to the Fire. When the Holy Prophet was asked to pray for the 
destruction of a people who were fighting against him, he prayed thus: "My Lord, 
forgive them because they do not know". So long as a man is alive, however hard 
he may be in his disbelief, it is not forbidden to pray for his forgiveness or gui- 
dance. But when he is dead, God will deal with him as He pleases, and He is the 
most Merciful of all merciful ones. According to a hadith, after all intercessions 
have taken place, the most Merciful of all will take a handful — and the handful 
with God is as vast as the heavens and the earth (39:67) — out of hell and throw 



252 9. THE IMMUNITY '9:115 

asking forgiveness for his sire was only owing to a promise which 
he had made to him; but when it became clear to him that he was 
an enemy of Allah, he dissociated himself from him. Surely Abra- 
ham was tender-hearted, forbearing. 115 And it is not (attributable 
to) Allah that He should lead a people astray after He has guided 
them, so far so that He makes clear to them what they should 
guard against." Surely Allah is Knower of all things. 116 Surely 
Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life 
and causes death. And besides Allah you have no friend nor 
helper. 

117 Certainly Allah has turned in mercy to the Prophet and 
the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of 
hardship, after the hearts of a group of them were about to deviate; 
then He turned to them in mercy. Surely to them He is Com- 
passionate, Merciful; 118 and (He turned in mercy) to the three who 
were left behind; until the earth, vast as it is, became narrow to 
them and their souls were also narrowed to them; and they knew 
that there was no refuge from Allah but in Him. Then He turned to 
them in mercy that they might turn (to Him). Surely Allah — He 
is the Oft-returning to mercy, the Merciful/ 

them into the river of Life, and these would be the people who never did any good 
(Bukhari 98:24). But under this verse the burial service, which is a prayer for 
forgiveness, is held only for Muslims, and not for those who die in disbelief. 

a (115) This verse establishes in clear words that Allah never leads a people 
astray; and how could He lead astray, says the Quran, when He it is Who gives 
them guidance, and makes clear to them the evils they should guard against? 

b (117) Taubah on the part of Allah means His turning to His servant and 
changing one state to another which is higher than it. Allah's turning mercifully is 
in relation to the Prophet and those sincere believers who are plainly stated to 
have followed the Prophet in the hour of difficulty. The group whose hearts were 
about to deviate is referred to in the next verse. 

c (118) These were three men from among the Ansar, referred to in v. 106. 
The words were left behind may mean left behind with respect to the command- 
ment of Allah concerning them, as v. 106 speaks of them as being "made to await 
Allah's command". They remained cut off from all relations with the Muslims for 
fifty days. Ka'b ibn Malik, one of the three men, was a man of importance, and 
when he received a letter from the king of Ghassan, offering him a position under 
him if he deserted the Prophet, he burned the letter, showing his contempt for the 
offer, and gave no reply. 



9:119' THE FAITHFUL 253 

Section 15: What the Faithful should do 

119 O you who believe, keep your duty to Allah and be with 
the truthful. 120 It was not proper for the people of Madinah and 
those round about them of the dwellers of the desert to remain 
behind the Messenger of Allah, nor to prefer their own lives to his 
life." That is because neither thirst nor fatigue nor hunger afflicts 
them in Allah's way, nor do they tread a path which enrages the 
disbelievers, nor do they cause any harm to an enemy, but a good 
work is written down for them on account of it. Surely Allah does 
not waste the reward of the doers of good; 121 nor do they spend 
anything, small or great, nor do they traverse a valley but it is 
written down for them, that Allah may reward them for the best of 
what they did. 

122 And the believers should not go forth all together. Why, 
then, does not a group from every party from among them go forth 
that they may apply themselves to obtain understanding in religion, 
and that they may warn their people when they come back to them, 
that they may be cautious? 

Section 16: The Prophet's Great Anxiety 

123 O you who believe, fight those of the disbelievers who are 
near to you and let them find firmness in you. c And know that Allah 
is with those who keep their duty. 124 And whenever a chapter is 
revealed, there are some of them who say: Which of you has it 
strengthened in faith? So as for those who believe, it strengthens 



a (120) The meaning is that they should neither desire rest for themselves, 
nor comfort, nor protection, in preference to the Prophet; in other words, they 
should accompany him in difficulty and distress. 

b (122) In the midst of the ordinances relating to fighting, the Quran intro- 
duces the subject of the preparation of a missionary force, thus showing that this 
was the greatest necessity of Islam. It was only by means of a missionary effort 
that truth could be spread, and the ultimate object was not to be lost sight of, even 
when the community was engaged in a life-and-death struggle against over- 
whelming forces of the enemy. 

c (123) Because it was those who were near who persecuted the Muslims. 
The object was to stop persecution. Muslims must be firm and not yield to them.

them in faith and they rejoice. 125 And as for those in whose hearts 
is a disease, it adds uncleanness to their uncleanness, and they die 
while they are disbelievers." 126 Do they not see that they are tried 
once or twice in every year, yet they do not repent, nor do they 
become mindful. 127 And whenever a chapter is revealed, they 
look at one another: Does anyone see you? Then they turn away. 
Allah has turned away their hearts because they are a people who 
do not understand. 

128 Certainly a Messenger has come to you from among 
yourselves; very painful for him is your falling into distress, most 
concerned (he is) for you, to the believers (he is) compassionate, 
merciful. c 129 But if they turn away, say: Allah is sufficient for me 
— there is no god but He. On Him do I rely, and He is the Lord of 
the mighty Throne. 



a (125) The uncleanness of their hearts increased with new revelation, 
because it increased them in stubbornness, and their hearts were more and more 
hardened against truth. See also 71:6 footnote. 

b (126) These trials consisted of the expeditions which the Muslims had to 
undertake every now and then, and in which the hypocrites were distinguished from 
the true believers. 

c (128) This is the true picture of the heart which grieved, not for his 
followers alone, not for one nation or country, but for all humanity. He grieves for 
the burdens of all, and he is most concerned for the welfare of all. The whole of 
humanity is meant here because the concluding words refer additionally to the 
believers. There is a special relation he bears to those who follow him; to them he 
is, in addition, compassionate and merciful. 



Chapter 10 
Yunus Jonah 

This chapter makes a brief reference to the Prophet Jonah (v. 98), which gives 
it its title, to indicate that as the people of Jonah benefited by his warning, so 
would the Arabs ultimately believe in the Prophet Muhammad. While this 
chapter asserts the truth of revelation, it also lays stress on the merciful deal- 
ing of God with mankind. It tells us that He does not send punishment quickly 
and that evidence of His mercy is also found in nature. It also refers to the 
histories of Noah and Moses. This chapter was revealed during the last four 
years of the Makkan period of the Holy Prophet's life. 



Section 1 : Truth of Revelation 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Seer." These are the verses of the Book, full 
of wisdom. 2 Is it a wonder to the people that We have revealed 
to a man from among themselves: Warn the people and give good 
news to those who believe that for them is advancement in 
excellence c with their Lord? The disbelievers say: This is surely 
an obvious enchanter. 

3 Surely your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the 
earth in six periods, and He is established on the Throne of Power 



a (1-1) Alif, lam, ra are the three letters which stand at the head of this 
chapter and chapters 11, 12, 14 and 15, while chapter 13 has alif, lam, mim, ra. 
The abbreviation is of the same form as alif, lam, mim (see 2:1 footnote), except 
that ra stands for Ra ';', meaning the Seer, or ara, meaning / see. 

Chapters 10 to 16 all belong to the last four years of the Holy Prophet's life 
at Makkah, and deal with the truth of prophethood with more or less reference to 
the histories of the earlier prophets, four of them being named after a prophet. 

b (1-2) The Book, i.e. the Quran, is called hakim, meaning wise or full of 
wisdom, because it possesses the quality which discriminates between truth and 
falsehood and right and wrong, and because it is free from all unsoundness. 

c (2) The words "advancement in excellence" may also be translated as a 
footing of firmness.

mission. This is Allah, your Lord, therefore serve Him. Will you 
not be mindful? 4 To Him is your return, of all (of you). It is the 
promise of Allah (made) in truth. Surely He produces the first 
creation, then He reproduces it, that He may reward with equity 
those who believe and do good. And as for those who disbelieve, 
for them is a drink of hot water and a painful punishment because 
they disbelieved. 

5 He it is Who made the sun a shining brightness, and the 
moon a light, and ordained for it stages that you might know the 
computation of years and the reckoning. Allah did not create this 
but with truth. He makes the signs clear for a people who know. 
6 Surely in the alternation of the night and the day, and what Allah 
has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for a people 
who keep their duty. c 

7 Those who do not expect the meeting with Us, and are plea- 
sed with this world's life and are satisfied with it, and those who 
are heedless of Our messages — 8 these, their abode is the Fire 
because of what they earned. 9 Those who believe and do good, 
their Lord guides them by their faith; rivers will flow beneath 
them in Gardens of bliss. i°Their cry therein will be, Glory be to 
You, O Allah! and their greeting, Peace! And the last of their cry 
will be: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds \ c 



a (3) For creation in six periods and the Throne of Power, see footnotes 
under 7:54. In regulating the Affair, there is a further reference to the spiritual 
evolution of man, as stated more clearly elsewhere: "He orders (or regulates) the 
Affair from the heaven to the earth" (32:5). For intercession, see 2:255 footnote 1. 

b (5) The moon is here called mir because its light is borrowed, as contrasted 
with the sun which is called here diycC. 

c (6) The whole of creation is, despite its variety, subject to one law, and 
clearly bears witness to the unity of its Maker. And just as the visible universe is 
subject to law, there is also a law working in the spiritual world. 

d (9) The light of faith, which is even in this life a guiding principle of man's 
actions, will assume a more palpable form in the life after death. Compare 57:12, 
where it is called the light running, or gleaming, before them.

10:11* PUNISHMENT OF REJECTION 257 

Section 2: Punishment of Rejection 

11 And if Allah were to hasten for people the (consequences 
of) evil, as they would hasten on the good, their doom would cer- 
tainly have been decreed for them. But We leave those alone, who 
have no hope of meeting with Us, in their inordinacy, blindly 
wandering on. a 12 And when affliction touches man, he calls on 
Us, whether lying on his side or sitting or standing; but, when We 
remove his affliction from him, he passes on as though he had 
never called on Us on account of an affliction that touched him. 
Thus what they do is made to seem good to the extravagant. 13 And 
certainly We destroyed generations before you when they did 
wrong, and their messengers came to them with clear arguments, 
yet they would not believe. Thus do We recompense the guilty 
people. 14 Then We made you rulers in the land after them, so that 
We might see how you act. 

15 And when Our clear messages are recited to them, those 
who have no hope of meeting with Us say: Bring a Quran other 
than this or change it. Say: It is not for me to change it of my own 
accord. I follow only what is revealed to me. Indeed I fear, if I 
disobey my Lord, the punishment of a terrible day. c 16 Say: If Allah 
had desired, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have 
made it known to you. I have lived among you a lifetime before it. 
Do you not then understand? 17 Who is then more unjust than he 

the allegation that the Muslim concept of paradise is characterized by sensuality. 

a (11) People desire and pray for good things to be hastened on to them, and 
they are hastened on, but in His merciful dealing God does not hasten on the con- 
sequences of evil, so that people may repent and escape those consequences. 

b (15-1) They desire a revelation which should not condemn their evil ways 
and their idol- worship, nor contain any threats of their coming doom. 

c (15-2) These words show how true the Holy Prophet himself was to reve- 
lation, translating every one of its precepts into practice. 

rf(16) The Holy Prophet's truthfulness and honesty before he received the 
Divine revelation were undisputed, and he had earned such renown for these 
qualities that he was known as al-Amin, i.e. the Faithful one, or the Truthful one. 
If, as they admitted, he had never told a lie in his lifetime, even for the sake of a 
personal advantage, how could he, now that he had passed the age of youth, speak 
falsely, and that to his own detriment? He was not the gainer, but a sufferer thereby, 



258 10. JONAH -10:18 

who forges a lie against Allah or calls His messages a lie? Surely 
the guilty never succeed. 

18 And they serve besides Allah that which can neither harm 
them nor benefit them, and they say: These are our intercessors 
with Allah. Say: Would you inform Allah of what He does not 
know in the heavens and the earth? Glory be to Him, and supremely 
exalted is He above what they set up as partners (with Him)! 
19 And (all) people are but a single nation, then they disagree. And 
if a word had not already gone forth from your Lord, the matter 
would have certainly been decided between them regarding that in 
which they disagree." 20 And they say: Why is not a sign sent to 
him from his Lord? Say: The unseen is only for Allah, so wait; I 
too am waiting along with you. 

Section 3: Merciful Dealing 

21 And when We make people taste of mercy after an afflic- 
tion touches them, lo! they devise plans against Our messages. 
Say: Allah is quicker to plan. Surely Our messengers write down 
what you plan. 22 He it is Who makes you travel by land and sea; 
until, when you are in the ships, and they sail on with them in a 
pleasant breeze, and they rejoice at it, a violent wind overtakes 
them and waves surge in on them from all sides, and they think 
they are surrounded. Then they pray to Allah, being sincere to 
Him in obedience: If You deliver us from this, we will certainly 



on account of the persecution which his preaching had brought about for him. 
Moreover, a man who had so long refrained from showing any interest in their 
lives and their modes of worship, and had all but lived the silent life of a recluse 
among them, could not, of his own accord, be imagined to have suddenly changed 
the course of his life. 

a (19) The word that had gone forth is referred to in many places: "And they 
say: When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful? Say: Maybe some- 
thing of what you seek to hasten has drawn near to you" (27:71-72). And again: 
"Say: You have the appointment of a day which you cannot postpone by an hour, 
nor bring it forward" (34:30). 

b (20) It is clear from the context that their demand is for the punishment 
with which they are threatened, because they would recognize no other sign; they 
are told to wait for the sign which would undoubtedly come. 



10 : 23 • MERCIFUL DEALING 259 

be from among the grateful ones. 23 But when He delivers them, lo! 
they are unjustly rebellious in the earth. O people, your rebellion is 
against yourselves — a provision (only) of this world's life. Then 
to Us is your return, so We shall inform you of what you did. 

24 The likeness of this world's life is only as water which We 
send down from the clouds, then the vegetation of the earth, of 
which people and cattle eat, grows luxuriantly thereby; until when 
the earth puts on its golden attire and it becomes adorned, and its 
people think that they are masters of it, Our command comes to it, 
by night or by day, so We render it as reaped seed-produce, as 
though it had not flourished yesterday. Thus do We make clear the 
messages for a people who reflect. 

25 And Allah invites to the abode of peace, and guides whom 
He pleases to the right path. a 26 For those who do good is good 
(reward) and more (than this). Neither darkness nor disgrace will 
cover their faces. These are the owners of the Garden; in it they 
will abide. 27 And those who earn evil, the punishment of an evil is 
the like of it, and humiliation will cover them — they will have 
none to protect them from Allah — as if their faces had been 
covered with slices of the dense darkness of night. These are the 
companions of the Fire; in it they will abide. 

28 And on the day when We gather them all together, then 
We shall say to those who set up partners (with Allah): Stay where 
you are, you and your associate-gods. Then We shall separate 
them from one another, and their associate-gods will say: It was 
not us that you served. 29 So Allah is sufficient as a witness between 



a (25) This is another description of the Muslim paradise, which is called 
dar al-salam, or the abode of peace. The word salam in dar al-salam is from the 
same root as Islam. Islam, in fact, makes even this world an abode of peace for a 
true Muslim; he makes his peace with his Lord, and he lives at peace with his 
fellow beings. The peace of the next life is, in fact, a continuation of the peace of 
mind which a Muslim finds in this very life. 

b (26) Throughout the Quran the reward of virtue is spoken of as being much 
more than actual recompense, while evil is either spoken of as being forgiven or 
as being punished only with a like punishment. See 42:25-26 and 6: 160.

30 There will every soul become acquainted with what it did before, 
and they will be brought back to Allah, their true Patron, and what 
they devised will escape from them. 

Section 4: Uniqueness of Divine Gifts 

31 Say: Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the 
earth, or who controls the hearing and the sight, and who brings 
forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the 
living? And who regulates the affair? They will say: Allah. Say 
then: Will you not then guard against evil? 32 Such then is Allah, 
your true Lord. And what is there after the truth but error? How 
then are you turned away (from truth)! 33 Thus does the word of 
jour Lord prove true against those who transgress that they do not 
believe." 

34 Say: Is there anyone among your associate-gods who pro- 
duces the first creation, then reproduces it? Say: Allah produces 
the first creation, then He reproduces it. How are you then turned 
away (from truth)! 35 Say: Is there any of your associate-gods who 
guides to the Truth? Say: Allah guides to the Truth. Is He then 
Who guides to the Truth more worthy to be followed, or he who 
cannot find the way unless he is guided? What is the matter with 
you? How do you judge? 36 And most of them follow only conjec- 
ture. Surely conjecture will not avail at all against the Truth. Truly 
Allah is Knower of what they do. 

37 And this Quran is not such as could be forged by those 
besides Allah, but it is a verification of what is before it and a 
clear explanation of the Book, there is no doubt in it, from the Lord 
of the worlds. 38 0r say they: He has forged it? Say: Then bring a

gression. 

b (37) The Quran explains in clear words many of the most important prin- 
ciples of religion which are left ambiguous or obscure in the previous books. For 
instance, the Bible is obscure on the important principle of resurrection or life 
after death. Similarly the attributes of the Divine Being are not explained in clear

chapter like it, and call upon whom you can besides Allah, if you 
are truthful. 39 But they reject that whose knowledge they cannot 
encompass and whose final sequel has not yet come to them." 
Even thus did those before them reject; then see what was the end 
of the wrongdoers. 40 And some of them believe in it, and some of 
them do not believe in it. And jour Lord best knows the mischief- 
makers. 

Section 5: The Guilty and their Punishment 

41 And if they reject you, say: My work is for me and your 
work for you. You are clear of what I do and I am clear of what 
you do. 42 And some of them listen to you. But can you make the 
deaf to hear, though they will not understand? 43 And some of them 
look at you. But can you show the way to the blind, though they 
will not see? ' 44 Surely Allah does not wrong people in the least, 
but people wrong themselves. 

45 And on the day when He will gather them, as though they 
had not stayed but an hour of the day, they will recognize one 
another. They perish indeed who reject the meeting with Allah, 
and they do not follow the right way. 46 And if We show you some- 
thing of what We promise them, or cause you to die (before that), 
yet to Us is their return, and Allah is Witness to what they do. e 
47 And for every nation there is a messenger. So when their messen- 
ger comes, the matter is decided between them with justice, and 
they are not wronged. 

words and the result is the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus Christ. The Quran fully 
explains all such points and finally settles all these questions. 

a (39) The final sequel is the consequence of the rejection of the Truth. 

b (43) Compare 7:179: "They have hearts with which they do not understand, 
and they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they 
do not hear." 

c (46) The significance of the words "to Us is their return" is that those who 
are warned will be dealt with by Allah as they deserve, and the warning will prove 
true. It is no concern of theirs whether the Prophet lives to punish them with his 
own hands or that punishment is executed by Allah in some other way. 

rf(47) Compare 35:24: "And there is not a people but a warner has gone

48 And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if you 
are truthful? 49 Say: I do not control for myself any harm, or any 
benefit, except what Allah pleases." Every nation has a term. When 
their term comes, they cannot postpone it an hour, nor bring it 
forward. 50 Say: Do you see if His punishment comes to you by 
night or by day? c What (part) of it would the guilty hasten? 51 And 
when it comes to pass, will you believe in it? What! now! and you 
hastened it on. 52 Then will it be said to those who were unjust: 
Taste abiding punishment; you are not recompensed except for 
what you earned. 53 And they ask you: Is that true? Say: Yes, by 
my Lord! it is surely the Truth, and you will not escape. 

Section 6: Mercy takes Precedence over Punishment 

54 And if every soul that has done wrong had all that is in the 
earth, it would offer it for ransom. And they will manifest regret 
when they see the punishment. And it will be decided between 
them with justice, and they will not be wronged. 55 Now surely 
whatever is in the heavens and the earth is Allah's. Now surely 
Allah's promise is true, but most of them do not know. 56 He gives 
life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned. 

57 O people, an admonition has indeed come to you from 
your Lord and a healing for what is in the hearts; and a guidance 

among them". Humanity will always be under the deepest obligation to the Holy 
Prophet for this broad humanitarian principle. By "between them" must be under- 
stood the messenger and those who charge him with falsehood. 

a (49-1) These are not the words which a pretender would utter but are those 
of an honest man who, without assuming any personal pretensions, preaches truth 
in all sincerity. The Holy Prophet is repeatedly made to disclaim any control of 
good and evil, so that he offers no low temptation to his followers. Truth must be 
accepted for its own sake, not for any hope of worldly gain or fear of worldly loss. 

b (49-2) The verse does not teach fatalism. It lays down a truth which no 
historian can deny. To every nation, as to every individual, is granted a term of 
life, and nations live and die like individuals. 

c (50) The coming of the doom by night or by day signifies its coming at a 
time when people are engaged in their revelries or occupied with their business 
transactions, so as to be utterly inattentive to the real values of life. 



10:58' GOOD NEWS FOR THE FAITHFUL 263 

and a mercy for the believers." 58 Say: In the grace of Allah and in 
His mercy, in that they should rejoice. It is better than what they 
hoard. 59 Say: Do you see the sustenance that Allah has sent down 
for you, then you make (a part) of it unlawful and (a part) lawful. 
Say: Has Allah commanded you or do you forge a lie against 
Allah? 60 And what do those think who forge lies against Allah of 
the day of Resurrection? Surely Allah is Bountiful to people, but 
most of them do not give thanks. 

Section 7: Good News for the Faithful 

61 And you are not (engaged) in any matter nor you recite 
concerning it any portion of the Quran, and you do no work, but 
We are witness of you when you are engaged in it. And not the 
weight of an atom in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from 
jour Lord, nor anything less than that nor greater, but it is (all) in 
a clear book' 

62 Now surely the friends of Allah, they have no fear nor 
do they grieve — 63 those who believe and keep their duty. 



a (57) They demanded punishment again and again, but they are told that 
Allah has sent to them that in which they will find a healing and a guidance and a 
mercy for them, viz. the Quran. Compare 29:51, where, in answer to a demand for 
a sign which should destroy them, the disbelievers are told: "Is it not enough for 
them that We have revealed to you (O Prophet) the Book which is recited to 
them? Surely there is mercy in this and a reminder for a people who believe". 

b (59) Just as Allah gave them the means of their physical sustenance, He has 
also sent His grace and mercy for their spiritual welfare through revelation. Yet 
they deprive themselves of the spiritual sustenance as if it were unlawful. Or the 
reference may be to their declaring certain things to be unlawful for them out of 
reverence for their idols. 

c (61) The clear book mentioned here is not, of course, a collection of written 
or printed sheets bound together. It is the book of the Divine law which makes 
every deed, good or evil, great or small, bring its recompense. 

d (62) The friends of Allah are those who help the Divine cause and invite 
people to faith in God. They attain to that spiritual height where fear and grief are 
unknown. There is also a prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Truth, for when a 
man attains his object, all his fear is gone and he no more grieves for the sacri- 
fices he has made. 



264 10. JONAH -10:64 

64 For them is good news a in this world's life and in the Hereafter. 
There is no changing the words of Allah. That is the mighty 
achievement. 

65 And do not let their speech grieve yon. Surely might belongs 
wholly to Allah. He is the Hearer, the Knower. 66 Now, surely, 
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah's. 
And what do follow those who call on associate-gods besides Allah? 
They follow nothing but conjecture, and they only lie. 67 He it is 
Who made for you the night that you might rest therein and the 
day giving light. Surely there are signs in this for a people who 
hear. 68 They say: Allah has taken a son (to Himself). Glory be to 
Him! He is the Self-sufficient. His is what is in the heavens and 
what is in the earth. You have no authority for this. Do you say 
against Allah what you do not know? 69 Say: Those who forge a lie 
against Allah will not succeed. 70 A little enjoyment in this world, 
then to Us is their return, then We shall make them taste severe 
punishment because they disbelieved. 

Section 8: Noah and Moses 

71 And recite to them the story of Noah, when he said to his 
people: My people, if my staying (here) and my reminding (you) 
by the messages of Allah is hard on you, on Allah do I rely; so 
decide upon your course of action and (gather) your associates. 
Then do not let your course of action be dubious to you, so have it 



a (64-1) The Holy Prophet said: "There has remained nothing of prophet- 
hood except mubashsharaty Asked what is meant by mubashshardt, he replied, 
"Good visions" (Bukhari, 92:5). Elsewhere good visions are said to be a part of 
prophethood (Bukhari 92:4), which shows that, as the prophets were informed of 
the triumph of Truth, so will their followers be given this good news in their 
visions. The upholders of the Divine cause, we are told, will not only be success- 
ful, they will also receive the good news of their ultimate triumph in good visions. 

b (64-2) The words of Allah here signify the prophecies. It is the prophecy of 
the good reward for the faithful that is mentioned immediately before these words, 
and the meaning of there being no change is that the prophetic word must be 
fulfilled; compare similar words used in 6:34, 6:115 and 18:27. 



10 : 72 • NOAH AND MOSES 265 

executed against me and give me no respite. a 72 But if you turn 
back, I ask for no reward from you. My reward is only with Allah, 
and I am commanded to be of those who submit. 

73 But they rejected him, so We delivered him and those with 
him in the ark, and We made them rulers and drowned those who 
rejected Our messages. See, then, what was the end of those who 
were warned. 74 Then after him We sent messengers to their people. 
They came to them with clear arguments, but they would not believe 
what they had rejected before. Thus do We seal the hearts of those 
who exceed the limits. 

75 Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and 
his chiefs with Our signs, but they were arrogant, and they were a 
guilty people. 76 So when the truth came to them from Us, they 
said: This is surely clear enchantment! 77 Moses said: Do you say 
(this) of the truth when it has come to you? Is it enchantment? 
And the enchanters never succeed. 78 They said: Have you come to 
us to turn us away from what we found our fathers following, and 
(that) greatness in the land may be for you two? And we are not 
going to believe in you. 

79 And Pharaoh said: Bring to me every skilful enchanter. 
80 So when the enchanters came, Moses said to them: Throw down 
what you are going to throw. 81 So when they had thrown down, 
Moses said: What you have brought is deception. Surely Allah 
will make it null. Surely Allah does not allow the work of mischief- 
makers to thrive. 82 And Allah will establish the truth by His words, 
though the guilty dislike (it). 



a (71) The challenge of Noah to his opponents was, in fact, being reproduced 
now as a challenge to the opponents of the Holy Prophet. And these opponents 
did, in fact, decide upon their course of action in their great council hall, perhaps a 
year or two later, and surrounded the Prophet's house in accordance with that 
decision. But the Prophet escaped unnoticed from among them and they were 
unable to lay their hands on him. 

b (74) They do not ponder over the truth, but, having rejected once, go on 
opposing its progress without reflecting on it. This condition is described as the 
sealing of the heart, because the heart ceases to reflect. 



266 10. JONAH -10:83 

Section 9: End of Opposition to Moses 

83 But, on account of the fear of Pharaoh and their chiefs 
persecuting them, none believed in Moses except a few of his 
people." And Pharaoh was truly high-handed in the land; and 
surely he was one committing excesses. 84 And Moses said: My 
people, if you believe in Allah, then rely on Him if you submit (to 
Him). 85 They said: On Allah we rely; our Lord, do not make us a 
trial for the unjust people. 86 And deliver us by Your mercy from 
the disbelieving people. 

87 And We revealed to Moses and his brother: Take for your 
people houses to abide in Egypt and make your houses places of 
worship* and keep up prayer. And give good news to the belie- 
vers. 88 And Moses said: Our Lord, surely You have given Pharaoh 
and his chiefs finery and riches in this world's life, our Lord, that 
they may lead (people) astray from Your way. c Our Lord, destroy 
their riches and harden their hearts, so that they do not believe till 
they see the painful punishment. 89 He said: Your prayer is accep- 
ted; so continue in the right way and do not follow the path of 
those who do not know. 

90 And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea. Then 
Pharaoh and his armies followed them for oppression and tyranny, 
till, when drowning overtook him, he said: I believe that there is 
no god but He in Whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of 
those who submit. 6 91 What! Now! And indeed before (this) you 



a (83) The Israelites believed in Moses as the verses that follow show. By 
his people, therefore, are meant Pharaoh's wife (66:11) and a believer (40:28). 

b (87) The qiblah is that facing which one prays, and therefore it indicates a 
place of worship. The Israelites were obliged to pray in their houses because they 
did not enjoy full religious liberty in Egypt and had no public places of worship. 

c (88-1) The significance is not that God had granted them riches to mislead 
people, but that this was the end for which they used their riches. 

d (88-2) Pharaoh and his people did not care for either arguments or signs. 
Moses therefore now prays for their punishment. 

e (90) In the agonies of death, even pronounced atheists have sometimes 
recognized the existence of God.

save you in your body that you may be a sign to those after you. 
And surely most of the people are heedless of Our signs/ 

Section 10: Those who heed Warning will Benefit 

93 And certainly We lodged the Children of Israel in a goodly 
abode and provided them with good things. Then they did not dif- 
fer till the knowledge came to them. Surely your Lord will judge 
between them on the day of Resurrection in that in which they 
differed. 94 But if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to 
you, ask those who read the Book before you. c Certainly the Truth 
has come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of the doubters, 
95 nor be of those who reject the messages of Allah, (for) then you 
will be from among the losers. 96 Surely those against whom the 
word of your Lord has proved true will not believe, 97 though every 
sign should come to them, till they see the painful punishment. 



a (92) That the body was really cast ashore, though the Bible does not mention 
it, is clear from the fact that the body of Rameses II, who is regarded as the Pharaoh 
of Moses, has been discovered as preserved among the mummies in Egypt. This is 
another instance of the insufficiency of the Bible narrative and of the truth of the 
Quranic statement where it supplements the Bible. The discovery now made could 
not have been known to the Holy Prophet; it was not known to any person in the 
world till very recently. 

b (93) This may be a prophetical announcement as to the Jewish attitude 
towards the Prophet Muhammad later on when he fled to Madinah. 

c (94) The person addressed in the Quran in the singular form is not always 
the Prophet but often the reader, as here. Nor do the words revealed to you (in the 
singular) show that the Prophet is meant, for the Quran is in many places spoken 
of as being revealed to all the people (see 2:136, 21:10). Verse 104 makes it clear 
that the reader is addressed: "Say: O people, if you are in doubt as to my religion". 
Throughout the Quran the Holy Prophet appears as having the greatest certainty 
about the word which was revealed to him, so much so that he never entertained 
the slightest doubt about the truth of the promises of future success and triumph. 
In the very next verse the words are, nor be of those who reject the messages of 
Allah, which shows clearly that it is the Prophet's opponents who are addressed 
here. The words "ask those who read the Book before you" mean: ask them 
whether previous revelation does not contain clear prophecies of the advent of 
such a Prophet.

98 And why was there not a town which believed, so that 
their belief should have benefited them, but the people of Jonah? 
When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of 
disgrace in this world's life, and We gave them provision for a 
while." "And if your Lord had pleased, all those who are in the 
earth would have believed, all of them. Will you then force people 
till they are believers? 100 And it is not for any soul to believe 
except by Allah's permission. And He casts uncleanness on those 
who will not understand^

signs and warners do not avail a people who do not believe. 
i° 2 What do they wait for, then, but the like of the days of those 
who passed away before them? Say: Wait then; I too am waiting 
along with you. 103 Then We deliver Our messengers and those 
who believe — even so (now); it is binding on Us to deliver the 
believers. 

Section 1 1 : Divine Judgment 

104 Say: O people, if you are in doubt as to my religion, (know 
that) I do not serve those whom you serve besides Allah, but I 
serve Allah, Who causes you to die; and I am commanded to be 
one of the believers, 105 and that you set yourself for the religion, 



a (98) Jonah bears a resemblance to the Holy Prophet in that his people 
benefited by the warning, as did the Arabs by the warning of the Prophet, though 
after much opposition. Jonah is thus the type of a prophet whose people were 
dealt with mercifully. 

b (99) Compare 2:256: "There is no compulsion in religion". The reference 
is to the great zeal of the Holy Prophet and his over-exerting himself in preaching 
the Truth: "Then perhaps you will kill yourself with grief, sorrowing after them, if 
they do not believe in this announcement" (18:6). {Editor's Note: The Quran tells 
us here that it is in the natural order of things that while some people believe, 
others do not, and no human being can or should apply compulsion to others in 
this regard.) 

c (100) Those who refuse to understand the truth will find uncleanness cast 
on them. The word rijs ("uncleanness") also means punishment, and the meaning, 
in that case, is that those who care not for the warning must receive the punish- 
ment.

Allah). i° 6 Nor call besides Allah on that which can neither benefit 
you nor harm you; for if you do, you shall then be of the unjust. 
107 And if Allah afflicts you with harm, there is none to remove it 
but He; and if He intends good to you, there is none to repel His 
grace. He brings it to whom He pleases of His servants. And He is 
the Forgiving, the Merciful. 

108 Say: O people, the Truth has indeed come to you from 
your Lord; so whoever goes aright, goes aright only for the good 
of his own soul; and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to its 
detriment. And I am not a custodian over you. 109 And follow what 
is revealed to you and be patient till Allah give judgment, and He 
is the Best of the judges. 



Chapter 1 1 
Hud 

The history of the Prophet Hud is referred to in this chapter. While the last 
chapter dealt mostly with abstract questions relating to the truth of revelation, 
this chapter illustrates the truth of those questions by referring to the histories 
of former prophets. Thus it deals with the histories of Noah, Hud, Salih, 
Abraham, Lot and Shuaib. A cruel and persecuting enemy is warned of the 
fate that befell previous people. This chapter was revealed during the last 
four years of the period of the Holy Prophet's life at Makkah. 



Section 1 : A Warning 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Seer. A Book, whose verses are charac- 
terized by wisdom, then they are made plain, from One Wise, 
Aware: 2 that you should serve none but Allah. Surely I am to you 
from Him a warner and a giver of good news. 3 And ask for- 
giveness of your Lord, then turn to Him. He will provide you with 
a goodly provision to an appointed term, and will bestow His 
grace on every one endowed with grace. a And if you turn away, I 
fear for you the punishment of a great day. 4 To Allah is your 
return, and He is Powerful over all things. 5 Now surely they cover 
up their breasts to conceal (their enmity) from Him. Now surely, 
when they put their garments as a covering, He knows what they 
hide and what they make public. Surely He is Knower of what is 
in the breasts.

a (3) One endowed with grace here is the possessor of spiritual blessings in 
addition to the material benefits spoken of in the preceding words.

back from lending an ear, or it is an allusion to their running away.

clear record. 7 And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth 
in six periods; and His Throne of Power is ever on water " that He 
might manifest (the good qualities in) you, whoever of you is best 
in deeds. And if you say, You shall surely be raised up after 
death, those who disbelieve say: This is nothing but clear deceit. 
8 And if We delay for them the punishment for a stated period, 
they will certainly say: What prevents it? Now surely on the day 
when it will come to them, it will not be averted from them, and 
what they mocked at will beset them. 

Section 2: Truth of Revelation 

9 And if We make man taste mercy from Us, then withdraw it 
from him, he is surely despairing, ungrateful. 10 And if We make 
him taste a favour after distress has afflicted him, he says: The 
evils are gone away from me. Certainly he is exultant, boastful, 
1 'except those who are patient and do good. For them is forgive- 
ness and a great reward. 

12 Then, may it be that you will give up part of what is 
revealed to you and your heart will be distressed by it, because 
they say: Why has not a treasure been sent down for him or an 
angel come with him? c Fou are only a warner. And Allah is in 



a (7-1) For the meaning of 'arsh or Throne of Power see 7:54 footnote 2. 
The great power of God which is manifested in the creation of man is connected 
with water because physical life grows out of water. Similarly, spiritual life grows 
out of revelation, which is so often compared with rain or water. God's great power 
has thus been made manifest through water, and hence with the creation of the 
heavens and the earth is mentioned the fact that God's Throne of Power is ever on 
the waters. The words that follow make it clearer still. 

b (7-2) The object of the creation of man and all that has been brought into 
existence is that the great qualities with which man is endowed should be mani- 
fested. But that manifestation, we are told in the words that follow, takes place not 
in this life but in the life after death. 

c (12) This passage does not signify that the Prophet intended to give up any 
part of the revelation; on the other hand, it is a strong statement indicating that he 
could not do it. It is a peculiar use of the word la 'alia ("maybe"). When it is in- 
tended to show a person's remoteness from a thing, it is said: Maybe he has power 
to do such a thing. 



272 11. HUD -11:13 

charge of all things. 13 Or, say they: He has forged it. Say: Then 
bring ten forged chapters like it, and call upon whom you can 
besides Allah, if you are truthful." 14 But if they do not answer you, 
then know that it is revealed by Allah's knowledge, and that there 
is no God but He. Will you then submit?* 

15 Whoever desires this world's life and its finery — We repay 
them their deeds in it, and they are not made to suffer loss in it. 
16 These are they for whom there is nothing but Fire in the Here- 
after. And what they work in it is fruitless and their deeds are 
futile. e 17 Is he then (like these) who has with him clear proof from 
his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it, and before it (is) the 
Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy? These believe in it. And 
whoever of the parties disbelieves in it, the Fire is his promised 
place. So do not be in doubt about it. Surely it is the truth from 
jour Lord, but most people do not believe. 



a (13) See also 2:23 and footnote. This challenge is contained in four different 
chapters of the Quran. The earliest in point of revelation is 17:88: "Say: If people 
and jinn should combine together to bring the like of this Quran, they could not 
bring the like of it, though some of them were aiders of others." Then in the verse 
above, the demand is reduced to ten chapters. Lastly in 10:38 and 2:23 they are 
challenged to produce a single chapter like the Quran. Another point worth noting 
is that, while in 17:88 people and jinn are challenged, in 2:23 the word shuhada', 
which means helpers, leaders or their great or learned men, is substituted for jinn, 
thus showing that jinn in 17:88 are only human beings. 

b (14) If the false gods or the leaders do not answer their devotees when they 
call on them to assist them in producing a like of the Quran, then at least no doubt 
should be left in their minds that the Quran is not the work of the Prophet, but a 
revelation from the Divine Being. 

c (16) That is, their deeds will not result in any good to them. 

d(\l) He who has with him clear proof from his Lord applies to every 
believer in the truth of the Quran; the words these believe in it, occurring further 
on, make this clear. The witness from Allah, who recites it, is the Holy Prophet, 
who is called a witness elsewhere, as being an exemplar for the believers. Besides 
being a clear proof in itself, the Quran has a further evidence of its truth in the 
book of Moses, which is, therefore, called a guide and a mercy, because it con- 
tains clear prophecies of the truth of the Prophet. The meaning of the whole 
passage is: He who, being a believer in the truth of the Quran, has clear proof 
from his Lord, and who has an exemplar for him in the person of the Holy 
Prophet, and has additional testimony of his truth in the book of Moses, is not like 



11:18* HISTORY OF NOAH 273 

18 And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against 
Allah? These will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses 
will say:" These are they who lied against their Lord. Now surely 
the curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers, 19 who hinder (people) 
from the path of Allah and desire to make it crooked. And they are 
disbelievers in the Hereafter. 20 These will not escape in the earth, 
nor do they have guardians besides Allah. The punishment will be 
doubled for them. They could not bear to hear, c and they did not 
see. 21 These are they who have lost their souls, and what they 
forged is gone from them. 22 Truly in the Hereafter they are the 
greatest losers. 

23 Surely those who believe and do good and humble them- 
selves before their Lord, these are the owners of the Garden; in it 
they will abide. 24 The likeness of the two parties is as the blind 
and the deaf, and the seer and the hearer. Are they equal in con- 
dition? Will you not then be mindful? 

Section 3: History of Noah 

25 And certainly We sent Noah to his people (saying): Surely 
I am a plain warner to you, 26 to serve none but Allah. Indeed I fear 
for you the punishment of a painful day. 27 But the chiefs of his 
people who disbelieved said: We do not see you but (as) a mortal 
like us, nor do we see that any follow you but those who are the 
lowest of us at first thought. Nor do we see in you any superiority 
over us; no, we think you to be liars. 

28 He said: My people, do you see if I have with me clear 
proof from my Lord, and He has granted me mercy from Himself 



him who loves this world and cares not for the Truth. The latter statement, being 
included in the previous verses, is omitted here. 

a (18) The witnesses are according to some the angels; according to others, 
the prophets — and this is corroborated by 4:41; according to still others the 
believers. 

b (20-1) They would not escape the punishment, if Allah intended to punish 
them in this world. 

c (20-2) They could not bear even to hear what the Prophet said.

and it has been made obscure to you? Can we compel you to 
(accept) it while you dislike it? 29 And, my people, I do not ask you 
for wealth (in return) for it. My reward is only with Allah, and I 
am not going to drive away those who believe. Surely they will 
meet their Lord, but I see you a people who are ignorant. 30 And, 
my people, who will help me against Allah, if I drive them away? 
Will you not then be mindful? 31 And I do not say to you that I 
have the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say 
that I am an angel. Nor do I say about those whom your eyes 
scorn that Allah will not grant them (any) good — Allah knows 
best what is in their souls — for then indeed I should be of the 
wrongdoers. 

32 They said: Noah, indeed you have disputed with us and 
prolonged dispute with us, so bring upon us what you threaten us 
with, if you are truthful. 33 He said: Only Allah will bring it on you, 
if He please, and you will not escape; 34 and my advice will not 
benefit you, if I intend to give you good advice, if Allah intends to 
destroy you. He is your Lord; and to Him you will be brought 
back. 

35 Or do they say: He has forged it? Say: If I have forged it, 
on me is my guilt; and I am free of what you are guilty of° 

Section 4: History of Noah 

36 And it was revealed to Noah: None of jour people will 
believe except those who have already believed, so do not grieve 
at what they do; 37 and make the ark under Our eyes and Our reve- 
lation, and do not speak to Me on behalf of those who are unjust. 
Surely they will be drowned. 

38 And he began to make the ark. And whenever the chiefs of 
his people passed by him, they laughed at him. He said: If you 



a (35) The change shows positively that the disbelievers of Makkah are 
meant, and the reference is to their calling the Quran a forgery. This shows that 
the histories of the prophets are referred to in the Quran as a warning for the Holy 
Prophet's opponents. 



11 : 39 • HISTORY OF NOAH 275 

laugh at us, surely we, too, laugh at you as you laugh (at us). a 
39 So you shall know who it is on whom will come a punishment 
which will disgrace him, and on whom a lasting punishment will 
fall. 

40 At length when Our command came and water gushed forth 
from the valley,* We said: Carry in it two of all things, a pair, c and 
jour own family — except those against whom the word has 
already gone forth — and those who believe. And only a few 
believed with him. 41 And he said: Embark in it, in the name of 
Allah be its sailing and its anchoring. Surely my Lord is Forgiv- 
ing, Merciful. 42 And it moved on with them amid waves like 
mountains. And Noah called out to his son, who was apart: My 
son, embark with us and do not be with the disbelievers. 43 He said: 
I will take refuge on a mountain that will save me from the water. 



a (38) The laughing of the righteous at the wicked is not to be taken literally. 
You laugh at a thing to show your contempt for it; just as the disbelieving people 
showed their contempt for the making of the ark, the believer in Divine promise 
shows his contempt for their opposition and their plans to destroy him. 

b (40-1) Far al-tanniir has often been translated as the oven poured forth 
water or the oven boiled or the earth 's surface boiled up. But the meaning of fara 
which suits the context here, is not of boiling, but of water spouting forth, and that 
of tannur applicable here is not oven but a place where the water of a valley 
collects. 

c (40-2) By all things are meant all things needed by Noah, and not all things 
existing in the world, which was too extensive for Noah to travel over. 

d (42) The Quran does not support the story that the deluge covered the whole 
surface of the earth. On the other hand, it repeatedly speaks of Noah as having 
been sent to his people, i.e. to a single tribe, and according to the Divine law the 
punishment must have overtaken his people, who not only rejected the truth, but 
also sought to destroy Noah and his followers. The mention of the water flowing 
from the valley also shows that it was only a tract of land that was deluged, and 
not the entire earth. The taking in of a pair of all things does not mean that Noah 
had travelled over the whole earth and taken a pair of every living animal wherever 
it could be found. The order is clearly to take in pairs of all those things that he 
considered necessary for himself and those who were with him in the ark. The 
Bible narrative, which speaks of God "bringing floodwaters on the earth, to des- 
troy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life," (Genesis, 6:17), 
and then makes Noah collect and lodge in an ark a pair of each of the thousands 
of animals and birds, cannot be accepted. 



276 11. HUD -11:44 

He said: There is none safe today from Allah's command, but he 
on whom He has mercy. And a wave intervened between them, so 
he was among the drowned. 

44 And it was said: O earth, swallow your water, and O cloud, 
clear away. And the water was made to subside, and the affair was 
decided, and it rested on the JudI," and it was said: Away with the 
wrongdoing people! 45 And Noah cried to his Lord and said: My 
Lord, surely my son is of my family, and Your promise is true, 
and You are the most just of the judges. 46 He said: O Noah, he is 
not of your family; he is (an embodiment of) unrighteous conduct. 
So do not ask of Me that of which you have no knowledge. I admo- 
nish you so you may not be of the ignorant ones. 47 He said: My 
Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking of You that of which 1 
have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have mercy 
on me, I shall be among the losers. 48 It was said: O Noah, descend 
with peace from Us and blessing on you and on nations (spring- 
ing) from those with you. And there are nations whom We afford 
provisions, then a painful punishment from Us afflicts them. 

49 These are announcements relating to the unseen which We 
reveal to you; you did not know them — (neither) you nor your 
people — before this. So be patient. Surely the (good) end is for 
the dutiful. c 



a (44) The Greek name of this mountain is said to be Gordyoei, being one of 
those mountains which divide Armenia on the south from Mesopotamia (Iraq). 

b (46) When it is meant to speak of a person as the very embodiment of a 
certain quality, he is designated not as the possessor of that quality, but as that 
quality itself. In 2:177 it is said, literally, righteousness is the one who believes, 
the meaning being that such a person is the embodiment of righteousness. 

c (49) The announcement relating to the unseen is the fate of the opponents 
of the Holy Prophet as read in Noah's history. The words that follow — be patient 
— are a clear indication, for patient waiting was needed for the fate of the 
Prophet's opponents, not for anything relating to Noah's history. 



1 1 : 50 • HISTORY OF HUD 277 

Section 5: History of Hud 

50 And to Ad (We sent) their brother Hfid. fl He said: My 
people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. You are 
only fabricators. 51 My people, I ask of you no reward for it. My 
reward is only with Him Who created me. Do you not then under- 
stand? 52 And, my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn 
to Him, He will send on you clouds pouring down abundance of 
rain and add strength to your strength, and do not turn back, 
guilty. 

53 They said: Hud, you have brought us no clear argument, 
and we are not going to desert our gods for jour word, and we are 
not believers in you. 54 We say nothing but that some of our gods 
have struck you with evil. He said: Surely I call Allah to witness, 
and you should bear witness too, that I am innocent of what you 
set up (with Allah) 55 besides Him. So scheme against me all 
together, then give me no respite. 56 Surely I put my trust in Allah, 
my Lord and your Lord. There is no living creature but He grasps 
it by its forelock. Surely my Lord is on the right path. 57 But if 
you turn away, then indeed I have delivered to you the message 
with which I am sent to you. And my Lord will bring another 
people in your place, and you cannot do Him any harm. Surely my 
Lord is the Preserver of all things. 

58 And when Our commandment came to pass, We delivered 
Hud and those who believed with him with mercy from Us; and 
We delivered them from a hard punishment. 59 And such were Ad. 
They denied the messages of their Lord, and disobeyed His messen- 
gers and followed the bidding of every insolent opposer (of truth). 
60 And they were overtaken by a curse in this world and on the day 
of Resurrection. Now surely Ad disbelieved in their Lord. Now 
surely, away with Ad, the people of Hud! 



a (50) See 7:65 footnote. 

b (56) My Lord is on the right path signifies that He does not deviate from 
justice. 



278 11. HUD - 11 : 61 

Section 6: History of Salih 

61 And to Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih. a He said: 
My people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. He 
brought you forth from the earth and made you dwell in it, so ask 
forgiveness of Him, then turn to Him. Surely my Lord is near, 
answering. 62 They said: Salih, you were among us a centre of 
(our) hopes before this. Do you forbid us to worship what our 
fathers worshipped? And surely we are in grave doubt about that 
to which you call us. 63 He said: My people, do you see if I have 
clear proof from my Lord and He has granted me mercy from 
Himself — who will then help me against Allah, if I disobey 
Him? So you would add to me nothing but perdition. 64 And, my 
people, this is Allah's she-camel, a sign for you, so leave her to 
pasture on Allah's earth and do her no harm, or a punishment will 
soon come upon you. 65 But they hamstrung her, so he said: Enjoy 
yourselves in your houses for three days. That is a promise not to 
be belied. 

66 So when Our commandment came to pass, We saved Salih 
and those who believed with him by mercy from Us from the dis- 
grace of that day. Surely jour Lord — He is the Strong, the Mighty. 
67 And the cry overtook those who did wrong, e so they were motion- 
less bodies in their abodes, 68 as though they had never dwelt in 
them. Now surely Thamud disbelieved in their Lord. So away 
with Thamud! 

Section 7: Abraham and Lot 

69 And certainly Our messengers came to Abraham with good 
news. They said: 'Peace!' 'Peace!', said he. And he made no delay 



a (61) See 7:73 footnote 1. 

b (64) See 7:73 footnote 2. 

c (67) It was an earthquake. See 7:78. 

d (69) Whether they were angels or men, is not made clear here or anywhere 
else in the Quran. But as they did not partake of food, and the fact that they 
brought to Abraham news of a son and of the destruction of Lot's people, they are 
generally looked upon as angels who appeared in the similitude of men. 



1 1 : 70 • ABRAHAM AND LOT 279 

in bringing a roasted calf. 70 But when he saw that their hands did 
not reach to it, he mistrusted them and conceived fear of them. 
They said: Do not fear; we have been sent to Lot's people. 

71 And his wife was standing (by), so she wondered." Then 
We gave her the good news of Isaac, and beyond Isaac, of Jacob.* 
72 She said: O wonder! e Shall I bear a son when I am an extremely 
old woman, and this my husband an extremely old man? This is a 
wonderful thing indeed! 73 They said: Do you wonder at Allah's 
commandment? The mercy of Allah and His blessings be on you, 
people of the house! Surely He is Praised, Glorious. 

74 So when fear departed from Abraham and good news came 
to him, he began to plead with Us for Lot's people. 75 Surely 
Abraham was forbearing, tender-hearted, oft-returning (to Allah). 
76 Abraham, cease from this. Surely the decree of jour Lord has 
gone forth and a punishment must come to them which cannot be 
averted. 

77 And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was grieved for 
them, and he was unable to protect them, and said: This is a 
distressful day! 

78 And his people came to him, (as if) driven on towards him, 
and they were used to the doing of evil deeds before. He said: My 



a (71-1) It is made clear in 5 1 :24-34 that the news of the birth of a son was 
given to Abraham first. This explains Sarah's wonder. It was after receiving the 
good news of the birth of a son that Abraham was informed of the destruction of 
Lot's people. The statement made further on that Sarah was given the good news 
of the birth of a son is by way of reassurance on her expression of wonder, and to 
give the further news of a son's son, Jacob. 

6(71-2) Compare Genesis 18:10-12. The mention of a son's son (Jacob) 
was to show that that son should have progeny. The word ward ' ("beyond") also 
means a son's son. Elsewhere Jacob is expressly called nafilah (21:72) which 
means a grandson. 

c (72) The original words yd wailatd, while used to express grief and sorrow, 
are also used to express wonder. 

d (73) AM al-bait ("people of the house") includes the wife of a person; in 
fact, it is Abraham's wife who is primarily addressed here. The same phrase in the 
case of the Holy Prophet (33:33) includes his wives as well as his children. 



280 11. HUD '11:79 

people, these are my daughters — they are purer for you; so guard 
against (the punishment of) Allah and do not disgrace me about 
my guests. Is there not among you any right-minded man? " 
79 They said: Certainly you know that we have no claim on jour 
daughters, and you know what we desire. 80 He said: If only I had 
the power to repel you! — rather I shall have recourse to a strong 
support. 

81 They said: Lot, we are the messengers of jour Lord. They 
shall not reach you. So travel with your people for a part of the 
night — and let none of you turn back — except your wife. Surely 
whatsoever befalls them shall befall her. Surely their appointed 
time is the morning. Is not the morning near? 82 So when Our decree 
came to pass, We turned them upside down, and rained on them 
stones, as decreed, one after another, c 83 marked (for punishment) 
with your Lord. And it is not far off from the wrongdoers. 



a (78) Lot, it appears from Genesis 19:9, was a stranger in the city, and the 
messengers being strangers, the townsmen would not allow him to keep them. Lot 
offered his daughters as hostages so that he might be allowed to keep his guests 
with him, for according to 15:70 he had not permission to allow any stranger to 
come under his roof. Another view is that Lot offered his daughters for marriage, 
as thus he would not be a stranger among them but would be one of them. Some 
commentators have suggested that Lot did not point to his real daughters, but to 
women of the tribe, because a prophet would speak of the women of his tribe as 
his daughters, and in that case he did no more than point to the natural relation of 
man and woman. The answer of his people seems, however, to relate to his 
daughters. 

b (80) Allah is the strong support to Whom the righteous have recourse 
when they are in trouble. The particle au signifies or, as well as rather. 

c (82) It was a severe earthquake, which so utterly demolished the cities as to 
turn them upside down. In 15:73 it is called a rumbling that precedes an earth- 
quake; see 7:84. The raining down of stones might have been the result of a volca- 
nic eruption which was accompanied by an earthquake. 

rf(83) The concluding words indicate a reversion to the subject of the 
punishment of the opponents of the Holy Prophet. It refers to the punishment. 



1 1 : 84 • HISTORY OF SHUAIB 281 

Section 8: History of Shuaib 

84 And to Midian (We sent) their brother Shuaib. He said: My 
people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. And do not 
give short measure and weight. I see you in prosperity, and I fear 
for you the punishment of an all-encompassing day. 85 And, my 
people, give full measure and weight justly, and do not defraud 
people of their things, nor act corruptly in the land, making 
mischief. 86 What remains with Allah is better for you, if you are 
believers." And I am not a keeper over you. 

87 They said: Shuaib, does jour prayer enjoin you that we 
should give up what our fathers worshipped or that we should not 
do what we please with regard to our property? So you are the one 
who is the forbearing, the right-directing! 

88 He said: My people, do you see if I have a clear proof from 
my Lord and He has given me a goodly sustenance from Himself? 
And I do not desire to act in opposition to you, in what I forbid 
you. I desire nothing but reform, so far as I am able. And with 
none but Allah is the direction of my affair to a right issue. In Him 
I trust and to Him I turn. 89 And, my people, do not let opposition 
to me make you guilty so that there may befall you the like of 
what befell the people of Noah, or the people of Hud, or the 
people of Salih. Nor are the people of Lot far off from you. 90 And 
ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him. Surely my Lord is 
Merciful, Loving-kind. 

91 They said: Shuaib, we do not understand much of what you 
say and surely we see you to be weak among us. And if it were not 
for your family, we would surely stone you, and you are not strong 
against us. 92 He said: My people, is my family more esteemed by 
you than Allah? And you neglect Him as a thing cast behind your 
backs! Surely my Lord encompasses what you do. 93 And, my 



a (86) Baqiyyat Allah would properly signify that part of man 's doing which 
remains with Allah, i.e., the righteous or good works, of which the recompense 
remains, the word conveying the same significance as bdqiydt in 18:46 and 19:76. 
But it may also mean what Allah leaves to you after you have paid the dues of 
others. 



282 11. HUD -11:94 

people, act according to your ability, I too am acting. You will 
soon know upon whom will come the punishment, that will dis- 
grace him, and who is a liar. And watch, surely I too am watching 
with you. 

94 And when Our decree came to pass, We delivered Shuaib 
and those who believed with him by mercy from Us. And the cry 
overtook those who did wrong, so they were motionless bodies in 
their abodes, 95 as though they had never dwelt in them. So away 
with Midian, just as Thamud perished! 

Section 9: The Wrongdoers and the Righteous 

96 And certainly We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear 
authority, 97 to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they followed the bid- 
ding of Pharaoh; and Pharaoh's bidding was not right-directing. 
98 He will lead his people on the day of Resurrection, and bring them 
down to the Fire. And evil the place to which they are brought! 
"And they are followed by a curse in this (world), and on the day 
of Resurrection. Evil the gift which shall be given! 

100 This is an account of the towns which We relate to you. 
Of them are some that stand and (others) mown down. 101 And We 
did not wrong them but they wronged themselves. And their gods 
whom they called upon besides Allah did not avail them in the 
least when the decree of your Lord came to pass. And they added 
to them nothing but ruin. 102 And such is the punishment of your 
Lord, when He punishes the towns while they are wrongdoers. 
Surely His punishment is painful, severe. 103 Surely there is a sign 
in this for him who fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is 
a day on which people will be gathered together, and that is a day 
to be witnessed. 104 And We do not delay it but for an appointed 
term. 

105 On the day when it comes, no soul will speak except by 
His permission; so (some) of them will be unhappy and (others) 
happy. 106 Then as for those who are unhappy, they will be in the 
Fire; for them there will be in it sighing and groaning —

107 abiding in it so long as the heavens and the earth endure, except 
as your Lord please. Surely your Lord is Doer of what He intends/ 
108 And as for those who are made happy, they will be in the 
Garden abiding in it so long as the heavens and the earth endure, 
except as your Lord please — a gift never to be cut off.* 

109 So do not be in doubt as to what these (people) worship. 
They worship only as their fathers worshipped before. And surely 
We shall pay them in full their due undiminished. 

Section 10: Believers are comforted 

110 And indeed We gave Moses the Book, but differences 
arose concerning it. And if a word had not already gone forth from 
your Lord, judgment would have been given between them. And 
they are surely in a disquieting doubt about it. m And your Lord 
will surely pay back to all their deeds in full. He indeed is Aware 
of what they do. 

112 Continue, then, in the right way as you are commanded, 
as also (should) those who turn (to Allah) with you. And do not be 



a (107) This limitation on the duration of abiding in hell — except as your 
Lord please — is given here and in 6:128, showing clearly that the punishment of 
hell is not everlasting. The next verse states that those in paradise will abide there 
as long as the heavens and the earth endure, "except as your Lord please", but this 
statement is immediately followed by another: A gift never to be cut off. This 
shows that in fact there is no limitation upon the eternity of paradise, and the 
words except as your Lord please have been used, in the case of paradise, only to 
express the unbounded power of the Divine Being and the fact that it is due to 
God's pleasure that they are there. In the case of hell, however, the words except 
as your Lord please are followed by a statement which corroborates the limitation 
thus placed, for, Fa"al or Doer, as an attribute of God, indicates that He does 
even those things which seem impossible to others. 

Three times in the Quran (4:169, 33:65, 72:23) abiding in hell for abad is 
mentioned, which is generally considered as meaning forever. However, abad 
signifies a long time as well as time without end. The Quran makes clear in 78:23 
that a long time is meant as it states there that the disbelievers will remain in hell 
for ahqdb, i.e. long years. 

b (108) In accordance with what is said here, that heavenly life is a gift never 
to be cut off, we have in 15:48: "Nor will they be ejected from there".

inordinate (O people). Surely He is Seer of what you do. 113 And 
do not incline to those who do wrong, so that the fire touch you; 
and you have no protectors besides Allah, then you would not be 
helped. 114 And keep up prayer at the two ends of the day and in 
the first hours of the night.* Surely good deeds take away evil 
deeds. This is a reminder for the mindful. 115 And be patient, for 
surely Allah does not waste the reward of the doers of good. 

116 Why were there not, then, among the generations before 
you, those possessing understanding who forbade mischief in the 
earth except a few among them whom We delivered? And the 
unjust pursued the enjoyment of plenty, and they were guilty. 
n7 And jour Lord would not destroy towns unjustly, while their 
people acted well. c 118 And if your Lord pleased, He would have 
made people a single nation/ And they do not cease to differ, 
119 except those on whom your Lord has mercy; and for this did He 
create them. And the word of your Lord is fulfilled: I will cer- 
tainly fill hell with jinn and people, all together. e 



a (113) Not only is man forbidden to do any wrong himself, but he should 
keep himself at a safe distance from wrong and refrain from leaning towards the 
wrongdoers. 

b (114) The times of prayer are clearly indicated here. Of the two ends of the 
day, the first is the fajr, or the prayer before sunrise, and the second includes the 
zuhr, or the early afternoon, and the 'asr, or the later afternoon, prayers. In the 
first hours of the night we have the maghrib, or the after sunset prayer, and the 
'isha ', or the prayer before going to bed. The two afternoon prayers and the two 
after sunset prayers, which are spoken of together, may under exceptional circum- 
stances be said together in each case. 

c (117) God does not destroy people unjustly. He destroys them only when 
they act corruptly and make mischief in the world. He would not destroy them if 
they act well, whatever their beliefs. Most of the commentators take the word 
zulm (injustice in the word "unjustly") here as meaning shirk or setting up 
partners with God, and the meaning becomes that God would not destroy people, 
even though they were guilty of shirk, provided they acted well. The translation in 
this case would be: your Lord would not destroy towns for wrong beliefs, while 
their people acted well. 

rf(118) God does not force people to one particular belief. He has given 
them the choice to accept or reject the truth. 

e (119) Here it is clearly stated that Allah created all human beings to have 



11:120' BELIEVERS ARE COMFORTED 285

gers is to strengthen jour heart with it. And in this has come to

121 And say to those who do not believe: Act according to your 
power, surely we too are acting; 122 and wait, surely we too are 
waiting. 123 And Allah's is the unseen in the heavens and the earth, 
and to Him the whole affair will be returned. So serve Him and 
put jour trust in Him. And jour Lord is not heedless of what you 
do. 



mercy on them. By His mercy He guides some to the right path, while to others, 
who go over to evil and make themselves deserving of hell, mercy will come only 
after suffering. It is by their own hands that they get into distress and difficulty, 
while Allah has mercy on them in extricating them from it. 

The filling of hell with jinn and people would be because they went against 
the ways which Allah had mercifully shown to them. Therefore they must pass 
through another ordeal, so that they may be purged of evil and made fit for 
spiritual progress. 



Chapter 12 
Yusuf Joseph 

This entire chapter gives a continuous account of the history of Joseph. At the 
beginning and the end it indicates that the purpose is to foretell the ultimate 
triumph of the Holy Prophet Muhammad and the final submission of those 
who were plotting against his life. It is also prophesied here that the mutual 
dealings of the Holy Prophet and his enemies would be similar to the deal- 
ings of Joseph and his brothers: they would persecute him but he would 
forgive them when they would ultimately come before him in submission. 
This chapter was revealed during the last four years of the period of the Holy 
Prophet's life at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Truth of Revelation 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Seer. These are the verses of the Book that 
makes manifest. 2 Surely We have revealed it — an Arabic Quran 
— that you may understand. 3 We narrate to you the best of 
narratives, in that We have revealed to you this Quran, though 
before this you were of those who are unaware.

stars and the sun and the moon — I saw them making submission 
to me. 5 He said: My son, do not relate your dream to your 



a (3-1) It is called the best narrative because it is the best picture of the 
dealing of the Quraish with the Holy Prophet, and the Prophet's dealing with 
them. It was in the very words of Joseph to his brothers — there is no reproach 
against you this day (v. 92) — that the Holy Prophet forgave the people of 
Makkah all the atrocities they had committed against him. 

b (3-2) The Holy Prophet's "unawareness" relates to his own future, of 
which this chapter gives a clear indication in the incidents of Joseph's life, viz. 
that he was to be expelled from his home but that his countrymen would ulti- 
mately come to him in submission, asking pardon for their faults. But "unaware- 
ness" here may also refer to all those things that are related in the Quran, because 
the Prophet knew nothing of them before revelation.

brothers, in case they devise a plan against you. The devil indeed 
is an open enemy to man. 6 And thus will jour Lord choose you 
and teach you the interpretation of sayings, and make His favour 
complete to you and to the Children of Jacob, as He made it 
complete before to your fathers, Abraham and Isaac. Surely your 
Lord is Knowing, Wise. 

Section 2: Plot against Joseph by his Brothers 

7 Surely in Joseph and his brothers there are signs for the 
inquirers. a 8 When they said: Certainly Joseph and his brother are 
dearer to our father than we, though we are a (strong) company. 
Surely our father is in clear error — 'Kill Joseph or banish him to 
some (other) land, so that your father's regard may be exclusively 
for you, and after that you may be a righteous peopled 10 A speaker 
among them said: Do not kill Joseph, but, if you are going to do 
anything, cast him down to the bottom of the well. Some of the 
travellers may pick him up. 

11 They said: Our father, why do you not trust us with Joseph, 
and surely we are his sincere well-wishers? 12 Send him with us 
tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play, and we shall surely 
guard him well. 13 He said: Indeed it grieves me that you should 
take him away and I fear that the wolf may eat him while you are 
careless of him. 14 They said: If the wolf should eat him while we 
are so many, we should then certainly be losers. 

15 So when they took him away and agreed to put him down 
at the bottom of the pit, We revealed to him: 7ou will certainly 



a (7) By inquirers are meant people who inquired about the Holy Prophet, 
who was at this time being persecuted most severely by the people of Makkah. 
They are told in plain words that the story of the Prophet and his opponents was 
the story of Joseph and his brothers. 

b (8) Benjamin, his brother by the same mother, is meant here. 

c (9) The conspiracy of the Quraish against the Holy Prophet is referred to in 
the Quran in the words: 'And when those who disbelieved devised plans against 
you that they might confine you or kill you or drive you away" (8:30).

inform them of this affair of theirs while they do not realize/ 
16 And they came to their father at nightfall, weeping. 17 They said: 
Our father, we went off racing with one another and left Joseph by 
our goods, so the wolf ate him. And you will not believe us, 
though we are truthful. 18 And they came with false blood on his 
shirt. He said: Indeed, your souls have made it a light matter for 
you. So patience is best. And Allah is He Whose help is sought 
against what you describe. 

19 And travellers came, and they sent their water-drawer and 
he let down his bucket. He said: Good news! This is a youth. And 
they concealed him as an article of merchandise, and Allah knew 
what they did. 20 And they sold him for a small price, a few pieces 
of silver, and they showed no desire for him. 

Section 3: Joseph's Firmness under Temptation 

21 And the Egyptian who bought him said to his wife: Make 
his stay honourable. Maybe he will be useful to us, or we may 
adopt him as a son. And thus We established Joseph in the land, 
and that We might teach him the interpretation of sayings. And 
Allah has full control over His affair, but most people do not know. 
22 And when he attained his maturity, We gave him wisdom and 
knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good. 

23 And she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him, and 
bolted the doors and said: Come. He said: Allah forbid! Surely my 
Lord made good my abode. The wrongdoers never prosper. 24 And 
certainly she desired him, and he would have desired her if he had 
not seen the clear evidence of his Lord. Thus (it was) that We 



a (15) The essential difference between the version of this story given in the 
Bible and the version in the Quran is that while the Bible narrates it as a simple 
story, the Quran preserves in it the spiritual element. 

b (18) The Quran represents Jacob as doubting from the very first the 
sincerity of Joseph's brothers, but not so the Bible. Again, according to the Quran, 
Joseph relates his vision to his father, who is at once apprehensive of the envy of 
his brothers, if they are apprised of it; but according to the Bible, Jacob himself 
rebuked Joseph for his dream. Besides several discrepancies, the Bible narrative 
represents Jacob as an ordinary man, while the Quran represents him as a prophet.

might turn away from him evil and indecency. Surely he was one 
of Our chosen servants." 

25 And they raced with one another to the door, and she tore 
his shirt from behind, and they met her husband at the door. She 
said: What is the penalty for one who intends evil to jour wife, 
except imprisonment or a painful punishment? 26 He said: She 
sought to seduce me. And a witness of her own family bore wit- 
ness: If his shirt is torn in front, she speaks the truth and he is a 
liar. 27 And if his shirt is torn from behind, she tells a lie and he is 
truthful. 28 So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said: 
Surely it is an intrigue of you women. Your intrigue is indeed great! 
29 Joseph, turn aside from this. And (my wife), ask forgiveness for 
your sin. Surely you are one of the sinful. 

Section 4: Joseph is imprisoned 

30 And women in the city said: The chief's wife seeks to 
seduce her slave. He has indeed affected her deeply with (his) 
love. Truly we see her in clear error. 31 So when she heard of their 
scheming, c she sent for them and prepared for them a feast, and 
gave each of them a knife, and said (to Joseph): Come out to them. 
So when they saw him, they thought him great, and cut their hands 
(in amazement), and said: Holy Allah! This is not a mortal! This is 
but a noble angel. 32 She said: This is he about whom you blamed 
me. And certainly I sought to seduce him, but he was firm in self- 



a (24) This does not show that Joseph had any desire for her, but that the 
temptation was so strong that, if he had not been strengthened by great faith in 
God, he would have fallen a prey to mortal weakness. 

b (28) The vindication of Joseph's character on this occasion, and the pro- 
duction of the evidence of the shirt, are not related in the Bible. The next section 
proves that Joseph was not cast into prison for being guilty of having committed 
an outrage against his master's wife. 

c (31-1) Some think that she knew that certain women had circulated the 
news with the object of getting a chance to see Joseph. 

rf(31-2) The Egyptians were a superstitious and polytheistic people, and 
anything strange, or any human being about whom they witnessed anything won- 
derful, was considered by them to be a god. 



290 12. JOSEPH • 12 : 33 

restraint. And if he does not do what I order him, he shall certainly 
be imprisoned, and he shall certainly be degraded. 

33 He said: My Lord, the prison is dearer to me than that to 
which they invite me. And if You do not turn away their intrigue 
from me, I shall yearn towards them and be one of the ignorant. 
34 So his Lord accepted his prayer and turned away their intrigue 
from him. Surely He is the Hearer, the Knower. 35 Then it occurred 
to them after they had seen the signs that they should imprison him 
for a while." 

Section 5: Joseph's Preaching in Prison 

36 And two youths entered the prison with him. One of them 
said: I saw myself pressing wine. And the other said: I saw myself 
carrying bread on my head, from which birds were eating. Inform 
us of its interpretation; surely we see you to be from among the 
doers of good.* 

37 He said: The food with which you are fed shall not come 
to you, but I shall inform you of its interpretation before it comes 
to you. This is from what my Lord has taught me. Surely I have 
forsaken the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah, and 
are deniers of the Hereafter. 38 And I follow the religion of my 
fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It does not befit us to set 
up any partner with Allah. This is by Allah's grace upon us and on 
mankind, but most people do not give thanks. 39 My two fellow- 
prisoners, are various lords better or Allah the One, the Supreme? 
40 You do not serve besides Him but names which you have 
named, you and your fathers — Allah has sent down no authority 
for them. Judgment is only Allah's. He has commanded that you 



a (35) There is nothing to show that Joseph was cast into prison on a charge 
of having committed an outrage on that woman. As he was proved guiltless of 
that charge, it is very likely that some other accusation was brought against him; 
and more probably an autocratic ruler needed no excuse for putting an innocent 
man into prison. By signs must be understood the signs of Joseph 's innocence. 

b (36) Compare Genesis, ch. 40, which, however, omits Joseph's preaching. 
The two youths were the butler and the baker. 



12:41' THE KING'S VISION INTERPRETED BY JOSEPH 291 

serve none but Him. This is the right religion, but most people do 
not know. 

41 My two fellow-prisoners, as for one of you, he will serve 
wine for his lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be cruci- 
fied, so that birds will eat from his head. The matter is decreed 
concerning which you inquired. 42 And he said to him whom he 
knew would be delivered of the two: Remember me with your lord. 
But the devil caused him to forget mentioning (it) to his lord, so 
he remained in the prison a few years. 

Section 6: The King's Vision interpreted by Joseph 

43 And the king said: I have seen seven fat cows which seven 
lean ones devoured, and seven green ears and (seven) others dry. 
Chiefs, explain to me my dream, if you can interpret the dream. 
44 They said: Confused dreams, and we do not know the interpre- 
tation of dreams. 45 And of the two, he who had found deliverance 
and remembered after a long time said: I will inform you of its 
interpretation, so send me. 

46 Joseph, truthful one, explain to us seven fat cows which 
seven lean ones devoured, and seven green ears and (seven) others 
dry, that I may go back to the people so that they may know. 47 He 
said: You shall sow for seven years as usual, then what you reap, 
leave it in its ear, except a little which you eat. 48 Then after that 
will come seven years of hardship, which will eat away all you 
have beforehand stored for them, except a little which you have 
preserved. 49 Then after that will come a year in which people will 
have rain and in which they will press (grapes). 

Section 7: Joseph cleared of the Charges 

50 And the king said: Bring him to me. So when the messen- 
ger came to him, he said: Go back to your lord and ask him, what 
is the case of the women who cut their hands? Surely my Lord 
knows their intrigue. 

51 (The king) said: What was your business when you sought 
to seduce Joseph? They said: Holy Allah! We knew of no evil on 
his part. The chief's wife said: Now has the truth come out. I sought 
to seduce him and he is surely truthful.

292 12. JOSEPH • 12 : 52 

52 (Joseph said:) This is that he might know that I have not 
been unfaithful to him in secret, and that Allah does not guide the 
plan of the unfaithful. * 53 And I do not call myself sinless; surely 
(man's) self is apt to command evil, except those on whom my 
Lord has mercy. Surely my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful. 

54 And the king said: Bring him to me, I will choose him for 
myself. So when he talked with him, he said: Surely you are in our 
presence today dignified, trusted. 55 He said: Place me (in autho- 
rity) over the treasures of the land; surely I am a good keeper, 
knowing well. 

56 And thus did We give to Joseph power in the land — he 
had mastery in it wherever he liked. We bestow Our mercy on 
whom We please, and We do not waste the reward of the doers of 
good. 57 And certainly the reward of the Hereafter is better for 
those who believe and guard against evil. 

Section 8: Joseph helps his Brothers 

58 And Joseph's brothers came and went in to (see) him, and 
he knew them, while they did not recognize him. s9 And when he 
furnished them with their provision, he said: Bring me a brother of 
yours from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure 
and that I am the best of hosts? 60 But if you do not bring him to 
me, you shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall you 
come near me. 61 They said: We shall try to make his father yield 
about him, and we are sure to do (it). 62 And he said to his servants: 
Put their money into their bags that they may recognize it when 
they go back to their family, so that they may come back. 



a (52) These are the words of Joseph, who explains his conduct in preferring 
to remain in prison until his innocence was established. 

b (53) When a man addressed Jesus as good master, he said: "Why do you 
call me good? No one is good but One, that is, God" (Mark 10:18). The righteous 
never attribute any good to themselves, but attribute all good to the Great Source 
of goodness — God. Man's self is here called ammarah, i.e. one apt to command 
evil. It is the lowest stage in spiritual growth. See also 75:2 and 89:30. 



12 : 63 • JOSEPH HELPS HIS BROTHERS 293 

63 So when they returned to their father, they said: Our father, 
the measure is withheld from us, so send with us our brother that 
we may get the measure, and we will surely guard him. 64 He said: 
Can I trust you with him, except as I trusted you with his brother 
before? So Allah is the Best Keeper, and He is the most Merciful 
of those who show mercy. 

65 And when they opened their goods, they found their money 
returned to them. They said: Our father, what (more) can we 
desire? This is our property returned to us, and we shall bring corn 
for our family and guard our brother, and have in addition the 
measure of a camel-load. This is an easy measure. 66 He said: I will 
by no means send him with you, until you give me a firm promise 
in Allah's name that you will bring him back to me, unless you are 
completely surrounded. And when they gave him their promise, he 
said: Allah is Guardian over what we say. 67 And he said: My sons, 
do not enter by one gate but enter by different gates." And I cannot 
avail you against (the decree of) Allah at all. Judgment is only 
Allah's. On Him I rely, and on Him let the reliant rely. 

68 And when they entered as their father had instructed them, 
it did not avail them against Allah at all, but (it was only) a desire 
in the soul of Jacob, which he satisfied. And surely he was 
possessed of knowledge, because We had given him knowledge, 
but most people do not know. 

Section 9: The Youngest Brother 

69 And when they came to Joseph, he lodged his brother with 
himself, saying: I am jour brother, so do not grieve at what they do. 
70 Then when he furnished them with their provision, (someone) 



a (67) Jacob, it seems, had come to know by Divine revelation that Joseph 
was there, and therefore he ordered them to enter by different gates so that Joseph 
might find his brother. The next verse makes it clear when it says: And surely he 
was possessed of knowledge because We had given him knowledge. 

b (68) The Bible narrative represents Jacob as being quite ignorant in the 
matter. 



294 12. JOSEPH • 12 : 71 

placed the drinking-cup in his brother's bag. a Then a crier cried 
out: O caravan, you are surely thieves! 71 They said, turning towards 
them: What is it that you miss? 72 They said: We miss the king's 
drinking-cup, and he who brings it shall have a camel-load, and I 
am responsible for it. 73 They said: By Allah! You know for certain 
that we have not come to make mischief in the land, and we are 
not thieves. 74 They said: But what is the penalty for this, if you are 
liars? 75 They said: The penalty for this — the person in whose bag 
it is found, he himself is the penalty for it. Thus do we punish the 
wrongdoers. 

76 So he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother, 
then he brought it out from his brother's sack. Thus did We plan 
for the sake of Joseph. He could not take his brother under the 
king's law, unless Allah pleased. e We raise in degree whom We 
please. And above everyone possessed of knowledge is the All- 
Knowing One. 77 They said: If he steal, a brother of his did indeed 
steal before. But Joseph kept it secret in his mind, and did not 



a (70-1) Though the Bible narrative ascribes the placing of the cup to Joseph, 
the Quran does not say so. It may have been one of Joseph's own brothers who 
did this act so that Benjamin might also be removed from Jacob, who loved him 
most after Joseph. There is a clear hint to this possibility in v. 77, where Joseph 
accuses them of having done some guilty deed: "You are in an evil condition", 
and a still clearer hint in v. 89, where Joseph says: "Do you know how you treated 
Joseph and his brother, when you were ignorant?" 

b (70-2) It is a mistake to suppose that the crier was the very person who had 
placed the cup there. As v. 72 makes it clear, it was the king's drinking-cup; in 
other words it was not Joseph's personal property, but the property of the king, or 
government property. It is clear that the men who provided corn were different 
from those who had charge of the king's property. 

c (76) This makes it clear that this was not Joseph's plan, but a Divine plan. 
In other words, the circumstances were made to assist Joseph to keep his brother 
with him. Joseph's desire, no doubt, was to retain his brother Benjamin while the 
others returned; but he was unable to do so under the laws of Egypt, as stated 
here. This shows that one living under an alien government should abide by the 
laws of that government. 

d (77) The brothers of Joseph made a false statement against Joseph to cast a 
veil over their own evil deeds. If Benjamin, they said, was a thief, so was his 
brother Joseph, as if they meant to say that this evil trait of character was due to 
the mother, Rachel (probably referring to the incident in Genesis, 31:19). 



12 : 78 • JOSEPH DISCLOSES HIS IDENTITY 295 

disclose it to them. He said: You are in an evil condition, and Allah 
knows best what you state. 78 They said: O chief, he has a father, a 
very old man, so take one of us in his place. Surely we see you to 
be one of the doers of good. 79 He said: Allah forbid that we should 
seize other than him with whom we found our property, for then 
surely we should be unjust! 

Section 10: Joseph discloses his Identity 

80 So when they despaired of (persuading) him, they 
conferred together privately. The eldest of them said: Do you not 
know that your father took from you a promise in Allah's name, 
and how you fell short of your duty about Joseph before? So I 
shall not leave this land, until my father permits me or Allah decides 
for me; and He is the Best of the judges. 81 Go back to your father 
and say: Our father, jour son committed theft. And we bear 
witness only to what we know, and we could not keep watch over 
the unseen. 82 And ask the town where we were, and the caravan 
with which we proceeded. And surely we are truthful. 

83 (Jacob) said: No, your souls have contrived an affair for 
you, so patience is best. Maybe Allah will bring them together to 
me. Surely He is the Knowing, the Wise. 84 And he turned away 
from them, and said: My sorrow for Joseph! And his eyes were 
filled " (with tears) on account of the grief, then he repressed 
(grief). 85 They said: By Allah! Fou will not cease remembering 
Joseph till you are a prey to disease or you perish. 86 He said: I 
complain of my grief and sorrow only to Allah, and I know from 
Allah what you do not know. ' 87 My sons, go and inquire about 
Joseph and his brother, and do not despair of Allah's mercy. c 



a (84) The word used can carry the meaning of being filled. Even if we 
accept the ordinary significance, his eyes were whitened, the meaning is that they 
were whitened with tears, which naturally came at the mention of Joseph. 

b (86) This shows clearly that Jacob knew by Divine revelation that Joseph 
was alive. 

c (87) Here the Quran again differs from the Bible and shows that Jacob was 
so certain of Joseph being alive because of the knowledge he received from God, 
that he sent his sons a third time to Egypt to ascertain about Joseph. It appears that 
he had an inkling also that Joseph was in Egypt. 



296 12. JOSEPH • 12 : 88 

Surely none despairs of Allah's mercy except the disbelieving 
people. 

88 So when they came to him, they said: O chief, distress has 
afflicted us and our family, and we have brought little money, so 
give us full measure and be charitable to us. Surely Allah rewards 
the charitable. 89 He said: Do you know how you treated Joseph 
and his brother, when you were ignorant? 90 They said: Are you 
indeed Joseph? He said: I am Joseph and this is my brother; Allah 
has indeed been gracious to us. Surely he who keeps his duty and 
is patient — Allah never wastes the reward of the doers of good. 
91 They said: By Allah! Allah has indeed chosen you over us, and 
we were certainly sinners. 92 He said: There is no reproach against 
you this day. a Allah may forgive you, and He is the most Merciful 
of those who show mercy. 93 Take this shirt of mine and cast it 
before my father's face — he will come to know. And bring to 
me all your family. 

Section 1 1 : Jacob goes to Egypt 

94 And when the caravan left (Egypt), their father said: Surely 
I scent (the power of) Joseph, if you do not call me weak of mind. c 
95 They said: By Allah! you are surely in your old error. 

96 Then when the bearer of good news came, he cast it before 



a (92) It is related that the Holy Prophet took hold of the two sides of the 
gate of the Ka'bah on the day of the conquest of Makkah and said to the Quraish: 
How do you think I should treat you? They said: We hope for good, a noble 
brother and the son of a noble brother. Then he said: I say as my brother Joseph 
said: "There is no reproach against you this day". 

b (93) The Quran does not say anywhere that Jacob had become blind. The 
shirt was sent as being a reminder of the torn shirt of Joseph, which Joseph's 
brothers had brought to Jacob (v. 18). 

c (94) When the caravan in which were Joseph's brothers departed from 
Egypt, Jacob again received assurance from on high about Joseph, so he said to 
those around him that he scented the power of Joseph. Jacob knew that Joseph 
was alive and of this he informed his sons again and again, but he now told them 
further that he had received an assurance from God that Joseph occupied a high 
position. 



12 : 97 • JACOB GOES TO EGYPT 297 

his face so he became certain. He said: Did I not say to you that I 
know from Allah what you do not know? 97 They said: Our father, 
ask forgiveness of our sins for us, surely we are sinners. 98 He said: 
I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Surely He is the For- 
giving, the Merciful. 

99 Then when they came to Joseph, he lodged his parents 
with himself and said: Enter Egypt in safety, if Allah please. 
100 And he raised his parents on the throne," and they fell prostrate 
for his sake. And he said: My father, this is the significance of 
my earlier vision — my Lord has made it true. And He was indeed 
kind to me, when He brought me forth from the prison, and 
brought you from the desert after the devil had sown dissensions 
between me and my brothers. Surely my Lord is Benignant to 
whom He pleases. Truly He is the Knowing, the Wise. 101 My Lord, 
You have given me kingdom and taught me something of the inter- 
pretation of sayings. Originator of the heavens and the earth, You 
are my Friend in this world and the Hereafter. Make me die in 
submission and join me with the righteous. 

102 This is from the announcements relating to the unseen 
(which) We reveal to you, and you were not with them when they 
resolved upon their affair, and they were devising plans. e 103 And 
most people do not believe, though you desire it eagerly. 104 And 
you ask them no reward for it. It is nothing but a Reminder for the 
nations. 



a (100-1) The meaning may be that he placed them in a good position. 

b (100-2) Seeing the highly dignified position to which Joseph had been 
raised in Egypt, they all fell prostrate before God as a mark of thanksgiving. 

c (102) Throughout the Quran the "announcements relating to the unseen", 
as here, signify not the ancient histories of past prophets, but a repetition of those 
histories in the life of the Holy Prophet Muhammad. Thus from this verse 
onwards the subject is changed to the Holy Prophet's opponents. The reference in 
"when they resolved upon their affair, and they were devising plans" is to the 
resolution of the Quraish and their plans against the Prophet, for which see 8:30. 
The Quran does not relate stories for the sake of giving information of the past, 
but for the lessons which they afford for the future guidance of man. 



298 12. JOSEPH • 12 : 105 

Section 12: A Lesson for the Prophet's Opponents 

105 And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth do they 
pass by, yet they turn away from it! 106 And most of them do not 
believe in Allah without setting up partners (with Him). 107 Do they 
then feel secure from the coming to them of an all-encompass- 
ing punishment from Allah or from the coming to them of the hour 
suddenly, while they do not perceive? 

108 Say: This is my way; I call to Allah, with certain know- 
ledge — I and those who follow me. And glory be to Allah! and I 
am not of those who set up partners (with Allah). 109 And We did 
not send before you any but men, from the people of the towns, to 
whom We sent revelation. Have they not then travelled in the land 
and seen what was the end of those before them? And certainly 
the abode of the Hereafter is best for those who keep their duty. 
Do you not then understand? 110 Until, when the messengers des- 
paired and (the people) thought that they were told a lie," Our help 
came to them, and whom We pleased was delivered. And Our 
punishment is not averted from the guilty people. m In their histories 
there is certainly a lesson for those who have understanding. It is 
not a narrative which could be forged, but a verification of what is 
before it, and a distinct explanation of all things, and a guide and a 
mercy to a people who believe. 



a (110) "They" refers to the people, not messengers. The messengers warn 
their people, but the latter are so stubborn that the messengers at length despair of 
their people. The people, on the other hand, think that what the prophets had told 
them about the coming of the punishment was a lie. Then it is that the promised 
help for the prophets comes and the punishment with which the evildoers are 
threatened overtakes them. That the prophets never despair of Divine assistance 
coming to them, in accordance with Divine promise, is clear from what has already 
been said in v. 87 (see also 15:56 and 29:23). 



Chapter 13 
Ai-Ra'd Thunder 

This chapter is named Thunder from the analogy of rain which is often likened 
to revelation in the Quran. As rain is accompanied by thunder and lightening, 
so is revelation accompanied by warning of punishment, although its real 
purpose is mercy. The chapter points to signs in physical nature to the truth 
of revelation and deals with the demand from the disbelievers to see the sign 
of punishment befalling them. It then tells them about the Divine laws which 
govern reward and punishment, and explains that the real miracles were the 
spiritual life that the Quran awakened in people and the transformation it 
would bring in the world despite facing great mountains of obstacles. This 
chapter was revealed during the last four years of the period of the Holy 
Prophet's life at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Truth of Revelation 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Best Knower, the Seer." These are verses of 
the Book. And what is revealed to you from your Lord is the 
Truth, but most people do not believe. 2 Allah is He Who raised the 
heavens without any pillars that you can see, and He is established 
on the Throne of Power, and He made the sun and the moon 
subservient (to you). Each one runs to an appointed term. He 
regulates the affair, making clear the messages that you may be 
certain of the meeting with your Lord. 

3 And He it is Who spread the earth, and made in it firm 
mountains and rivers. And of all fruits He has made in it pairs, 



a (1) The original Arabic consists of the letters alif, lam, mim and ra. These 
stand for ana (I), Allah, A 'lam (Best Knower) and Ra'i, (Seer) respectively. 

b (2) All heavenly bodies are raised high without any pillars that man can 
see. Those pillars are the laws of gravitation. All heavenly bodies, we are further 
told, run their course to an appointed term; they have a beginning and an end, as 
all things on earth have a beginning and an end.

two (of every kind). He makes the night cover the day. Surely 
there are signs in this for a people who reflect. 4 And in the earth 
are tracts side by side, and gardens of vines, and corn, and palm- 
trees growing from one root and distinct roots — they are watered 
with one water; and We make some of them to excel others in 
fruit. Surely there are signs in this for a people who understand." 

5 And if you wonder, then wondrous is their saying: When we 
are dust, shall we then be raised in a new creation? These are they 
who disbelieve in their Lord, and these have chains on their necks,* 
and they are the companions of the Fire; in it they will abide. 
6 And they ask you to hasten on the evil before the good, and 
indeed there have been exemplary punishments before them. And 
surely your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind despite their 
wrongdoing. And surely your Lord is Severe in retribution. 7 And 
those who disbelieve say: Why has not a sign been sent down to 
him from his Lord? Fou are only a warner and for every people 
a guide. 

Section 2: Fall and Rise of Nations 

8 Allah knows what every female bears, and what the wombs 



a (4) Unity in diversity is observable in the whole of nature, which is a sure 
sign of the Unity of the great Author of all existence. Besides this, as there is a 
difference in the produce of different tracts, though they are subject to the same 
laws of nature, even so are the hearts of people in relation to the growth of the 
seed of virtue, which is sown by revelation. 

b (5) The chains spoken of here are the chains which keep them constrained 
to evil usages and corrupt practices. 

c (6) The opponents of the Holy Prophet are told that the Merciful God would 
deal with them not according to their wrongdoings, but according to His vast and 
comprehensive forgiveness. But when evil outsteps all bounds, His very mercy, 
which must be exercised towards His righteous servants, requires that the wrong- 
doers should not be left without punishment. 

d (7) The words for every people a guide refer to the Holy Prophet. He was a 
warner indeed; he warned the evildoers of the evil consequences of their evil deeds, 
but he was ultimately to be a guide for every people, to lead them out of their evil 
ways and to set them on the right path. 



13:9" FALL AND RISE OF NATIONS 301 

fall short of completing and what they grow." And everything with 
Him has a measure. 9 The Knower of the unseen and the seen, the 
Great, the Most High. 10 Alike (to Him) among you is he who 
conceals the word and he who speaks openly, and he who hides 
himself by night and (who) goes forth by day.* n For him are 
(angels) guarding the consequences (of his deeds), before him and 
behind him, who guard him by Allah's command^ Surely Allah 
does not change the condition of a people, until they change their 
own condition. And when Allah intends harm to a people, there is 
no averting it, and besides Him they have no protector. 

12 He it is Who shows you lightning causing fear and hope 
and (Who) brings up the heavy cloud. 13 And thunder celebrates 
His praise, and the angels too for awe of Him. And He sends 
thunderbolts and strikes with them whom He pleases, yet they 
dispute concerning Allah, and He is Mighty in prowess. 

14 To Him is due the true prayer. And those to whom they 
pray besides Him give them no answer, but (they are) like one 
who stretches forth his two hands towards water that it may reach 
his mouth, but it will not reach it. And the prayer of the disbelie- 
vers is only wasted. 15 And whoever is in the heavens and the earth 
makes submission to Allah only, willingly and unwillingly, and 
their shadows, too, morning and evening. 

16 Say: Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: 
Allah. Say: Do you then take besides Him, guardians who control 



a (8) The physical law of nature is spoken of here with a deeper reference to 
the spiritual law, according to which some receive a new birth through the 
Prophet and others do not. The subject is made clearer in the verses that follow. 

b (10) A general law is given expression to here, with a deeper reference to 
the secret and open counsels against the Holy Prophet and to enemies seeking his 
life by day and by night. 

c (11) While the statement is no doubt general and refers to the guardian 
angels referred to in 6:61, there is a deeper allusion to the Divine protection 
specially granted to the Holy Prophet against the numerous enemies among whom 
he lived day and night. The angels guard the consequences of the deeds of man, 
and are therefore spoken of here as guarding him, i.e., guarding whatever he does, 
by Allah's command. 



302 13. THUNDER • 13 : 17 

no benefit or harm even for themselves? Say: Are the blind and 
the seeing alike? Or, are darkness and light equal? Or, have they 
set up with Allah partners who have created creation like His, so 
that what is created became confused to them? Say: Allah is the 
Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme. 

17 He sends down water from the clouds, then watercourses 
flow according to their measure, and the torrent bears along the 
swelling foam. And a scum like it arises from what they melt in 
the fire for the sake of making ornaments or tools." Thus does 
Allah compare truth and falsehood. Then as for the scum, it passes 
away as a worthless thing; and as for that which benefits people, it 
remains behind in the earth. Thus does Allah set forth parables. 
18 For those who respond to their Lord is good. And as for those 
who do not respond to Him, even if they had all that is in the earth 
and as much again, they would certainly offer it for a ransom. As 
for those, theirs is an evil reckoning and their abode is hell; and 
evil is the resting-place. 

Section 3: Good and Evil bring their own Reward 

19 Is he who knows that what is revealed to you from your 
Lord is the truth, like him who is blind? Only those who have 
understanding are mindful — 20 those who fulfil the pact of Allah, 
and do not break the covenant, 21 and those who join what Allah 
has ordered to be joined c and have awe of their Lord, and fear the 
evil reckoning. 22 And those who are steadfast seeking the pleasure 



a (17-1) The word used includes here all kinds of things necessary for the 
life of man, such as utensils, tools, implements, and instruments of war. 

b (17-2) The parable set forth here signifies that the Holy Prophet and his 
followers will live and prosper, as they work for the good of mankind. On the 
other hand, evil practices and worthless usages and customs, as well as those who 
uphold them, will be swept away before the mighty current of Truth, as rubbish is 
borne away by a torrent. 

c (21) While the previous verse deals with people's duty to their Maker, this 
refers to relations with His creatures. "What Allah has ordered to be joined" 
includes all those ties of love and relationship which Allah has taught human 
beings to observe and keep inviolate. 



13:23' GOOD AND EVIL BRING THEIR OWN REWARD 303 

of their Lord, and keep up prayer and spend (on good works) out 
of what We have given them, secretly and openly, and repel evil 
with good; a theirs is the (happy) issue of the abode — 23 Gardens 
of perpetuity, which they will enter along with those who do good 
from among their fathers and their spouses and their offspring; 
and the angels will enter in upon them from every gate. 24 Peace be 
on you, because you were constant — how excellent is then the 
final abode! 

25 And those who break the covenant of Allah after its con- 
firmation, and cut apart what Allah has ordered to be joined, and 
make mischief in the land, for them is the curse, and theirs is the 
evil end of the abode. 26 Allah amplifies provision for whom He 
pleases, and restricts (it also). And they rejoice in this world's life. 
And this world's life, compared with the Hereafter, is only a 
temporary enjoyment. 

Section 4: Revolution to be brought about by the Quran 

27 And those who disbelieve say: Why is not a sign sent 
down to him by his Lord? c Say: Allah leaves in error whom He 



a (22) Evil is a thing which is by all means to be repelled, and hence good 
for evil is recommended only in cases when evil would be repelled by that good. 
Unconditionally requiting evil with good would abolish all safeguards; evildoers 
who received nothing but good for every evil they committed would most assuredly 
establish a condition of anarchy by their evil deeds. Elsewhere it is said: whoever 
forgives and brings about reform (42:40). 

b (23) The Quran is full of clear statements that women shall enjoy the bliss 
of paradise. Azwaj is the plural oizauj, which means either husband or wife, and 
hence I have rendered it as spouses. 

c (27-1) The answer to this question is given at the end of this section: 
"disaster will not cease to afflict them because of what they do, or it will reach 
close to their homes, until the promise of Allah come to pass" (v. 31). This promise 
related to the utter annihilation of the power of the disbelievers. The question, 
why is not a sign sent down to him, here as elsewhere in the Quran, is a demand 
for the promised annihilation of their power and their defeat, and the answer is 
always conveyed in somewhat similar terms, stating first that they should ask for 
mercy; that the Quran has healing power, the condition of the faithful being a 
witness to it; that the fate of the former generations affords a lesson; that smaller 
calamities continue to afflict them, and in these they can see the signs of their

pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him) " — 28 those 
who believe and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of 
Allah. Now surely in Allah's remembrance do hearts find rest. 
29 Those who believe and do good, a good final state is theirs and a 
goodly return. 30 Thus We have sent you among a nation before 
which other nations have passed away, that you might recite to 
them what We have revealed to you, and (still) they deny the 
Beneficent. Say: He is my Lord, there is no god but He; in Him do 
I trust and to Him is my return. 

31 And if there could be a Quran with which the mountains 
were made to pass away, or the earth were split apart, or the dead 
were made to speak — indeed, the commandment is wholly Allah's. 
Do not those who believe know that, if Allah please, He would 
certainly guide all the people? And as for those who disbelieve, 
disaster will not cease to afflict them because of what they do, or 
it will reach close to their homes, until the promise of Allah come 
to pass. Surely Allah will not fail in (His) promise. 



ultimate vanquishment; and that finally, if all those tokens are rejected, the great 
calamity will not fail to overtake them. 

a (27-2) The contrast with those who turn to God makes it clear that Allah's 
pleasure to leave some in error is exercised only in the case of those who, though 
invited to God, do not turn to Him but choose to remain in error. The first part 
may also be translated thus: Allah leaves in error who will (remain in error). 

b (31) That the Quran should work such great wonders is not an impossi- 
bility but a fact, for we are immediately told that it will be brought about soon by 
Allah's commandment. At the time when these verses were revealed, difficulties 
in the spread of Islam appeared like mountains. It is a matter of history that they 
were made to pass away. The earth splitting apart means that the Quran would go 
deep down into the hearts of people, which are compared here to the earth. These 
words may also mean that the earth will be travelled over. There were no facilities 
at that time for going to distant corners of Arabia, to say nothing of the whole 
world. Yet not only was the whole of Arabia travelled over by the message- 
bearers of Islam within ten years after this, but within a hundred years of the 
Prophet's death Islam had traversed the whole of the known world, from the 
farthest East in China to the farthest West in Spain. It is again a matter of history 
that the dead were made to speak. People who were dead spiritually now spoke 
with such power that the whole earth from end to end responded to their call. 



13 : 32 • OPPOSITION WILL FAIL 305 



Section 5: Opposition will fail 

32 And messengers before you were certainly mocked, but I 
gave respite to those who disbelieved, then I seized them. How 
(terrible) was then My retribution! 33 Is, then, He Who watches 
every soul as to what it earns (like their associate gods)? And yet 
they ascribe partners to Allah! Say: Name them. a Would you 
inform Him of what He does not know in the earth, or of an out- 
ward saying? ' Rather, their plan is made to seem good to those 
who disbelieve, and they are kept back from the path. e And whom 
Allah leaves in error, he has no guide. 34 For them is punishment in 
this world's life, and the punishment of the Hereafter is certainly 
more grievous. And they have no protector against Allah. 

35 A parable of the Garden which is promised to those who 
keep their duty: In it flow rivers. Its fruits are perpetual and (so 
is) its plenty. Such is the end for those who keep their duty; and 
the end for the disbelievers is the Fire. 36 And those to whom We 
have given the Book rejoice in what has been revealed to you, e 
and some sects deny a part of it. Say: I am commanded only to 
serve Allah and not set up partners with Him. To Him do I invite 
(you), and to Him is my return. 37 And thus have We revealed it, a 



a (33-1) It is to show the utmost contempt for the alleged partners of the 
Divine Being that their worshippers are called upon to give them a name, as if it 
were said that they are not worthy of a name. Or the meaning may be, give them a 
name expressing any qualification of godhead, such as a sustainer, creator, etc. 

b (33-2) He knows both the inner feelings of man and his outward sayings, 
and He does not stand in need of a mediator. 

c (33-3) As stated in 29:38, it is the devil who makes their evil deeds seem 
good to people and keeps them back from the right path. 

rf(35) The paradise mentioned here is called a. parable, as also in 47:15. A 
saying of the Holy Prophet makes it clear that the blessings of paradise are such 
as no eye has seen, nor has ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to 
conceive of them (Bukhari, 59:8). The description given in the Quran is only a 
likeness of what it actually is, as it is of a nature entirely different from the things 
of this world. 

e (36) The Book may signify the Quran; or it may refer to the previous 
revelation, in which case the Jewish and Christian converts to Islam are meant 
here.

true judgment, in Arabic. And if you follow their low desires after 
the knowledge that has come to you, you would have against Allah 
no guardian nor protector. 

Section 6: Steady Progress of Truth 

38 And certainly We sent messengers before you and appoin- 
ted for them wives and children. And it is not in the power of a 
messenger to bring a sign except by Allah's permission. For every 
term there is an appointment. 39 Allah effaces what He pleases and 
establishes (what He pleases), and with Him is the basis of the 
Book." 

40 Whether We show you part of what We promise them, or 
cause you to die (before it comes about), your duty is only to 
deliver the message, and Ours to call (them) to account. 41 Do they 
not see that We are visiting the land, curtailing it of its sides?* 
And Allah pronounces a doom — there is no repeller of His 
decree. And He is Swift in calling to account. 42 And those before 
them planned indeed, but all planning is Allah' s. c He knows what 
every soul earns. And the disbelievers will come to know for 
whom is the (good) end of the abode. 43 And those who disbelieve 
say: 7ou are not a messenger. Say: Allah is sufficient for a witness 
between me and you and whoever has knowledge of the Book. 



a (39) The Divine ordinance to annihilate the power of the opponents of the 
Holy Prophet and to bring about the establishment of the Truth is called the "basis 
of the Book" {Umm al-Kitab), because the final defeat of the powers of evil, 
which was previously foretold, would be such a clear sign that it would dispel all 
doubts. 

b (41) The reference in curtailing the sides may be either to some of the 
exalted men having come over to Islam and the opposition being thus weakened, 
or to the diminution of the number of disbelievers, both high and low, by people 
daily leaving their ranks and joining the ranks of Islam. 

c (42) The meaning is that the plans of the enemy need not be feared, for all 
their planning is controlled by Allah, or that the requital of their plans is in the 
hands of Allah. 

d (43) Those who have any knowledge of previous revelation will testify to 
the truth of the revelation of the Quran, because it fulfils all previous prophecies 
and satisfies the criteria of a true revelation. 



Chapter 14 
Ibrahim Abraham 

This chapter is named after Abraham, whose prayer is mentioned in verses 
35 — 41. It explains that the work of the Quran is to lead people out of darkness 
into light, but that previous prophets too, such as Moses, had their message 
rejected at first. However, in all cases the opposition failed and God's promise 
to help the prophet was fulfilled. Truth is confirmed and man brings about his 
own ruin by rejecting it. Then Abraham's prayer for the right guidance of his 
descendants is mentioned and we are told that opposition to the truth will 
always end in failure. This chapter was revealed during the last four years of 
the period of the Holy Prophet's life at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Revelation dispels Darkness 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Seer. A Book which We have revealed to 
you that you may bring forth people, by their Lord's permission, 
from darkness into light, to the way of the Mighty, the Praised 
One, 2 of Allah, Whose is whatever is in the heavens and whatever 
is in the earth. And woe to the disbelievers for the severe punish- 
ment! 3 Those who love this world's life more than the Hereafter, 
and turn away from Allah's path, and would have it crooked. 
Those are far astray. 

4 And We sent no messenger but with the language of his 
people, so that he might explain to them clearly/ Then Allah 
leaves in error whom He pleases and He guides whom He pleases. 
And He is the Mighty, the Wise. 

5 And certainly We sent Moses with Our messages, saying: 



a (4) Nothing is said here about the extent of the mission of the Holy 
Prophet, which was for all mankind; see 7:158. All that is said here is that every 
prophet is sent with the language of his people so that he may explain to his 
people, because it is his people who are the first recipients of his message. 



307 



308 14. ABRAHAM • 14 : 6 

Bring forth jour people from darkness into light and remind them 
of the days of Allah." In this are surely signs for every steadfast, 
grateful one. 6 And when Moses said to his people: Call to mind 
Allah's favour to you, when He delivered you from Pharaoh's 
people, who subjected you to severe torment, and slaughtered 
your sons and spared your women. And there was a great trial in it 
from your Lord. 

Section 2: Truth is rejected First 

7 And when your Lord made it known: If you are grateful, I 
will give you more, and if you are ungrateful, My punishment is 
truly severe. 8 And Moses said: If you are ungrateful, you and all 
those on earth, then Allah is surely Self-sufficient, Praised. 

9 Has not the account reached you of those before you, of the 
people of Noah and Ad and Thamud — and those after them? 
None knows them but Allah. Their messengers came to them 
with clear arguments, but they thrust their hands into their mouths e 
and said: We deny what you are sent with, and surely we are in 
serious doubt about that to which you invite us. 10 Their messen- 
gers said: Is there doubt about Allah, the Maker of the heavens 
and the earth? He invites you to forgive you your faults and to 
give you respite till an appointed term. They said: You are nothing 
but mortals like us; you wish to turn us away from what our 
fathers used to worship, so bring us clear authority. 



a (5) "The days of Allah" signify His merciful dealings with the righteous 
and His punishment of the wicked. 

b (9-1) The Quran does not claim to give a history of all the prophets; see 
4:164 and 40:78. The statement made here is much wider. It is claimed that no 
other book mentions them all; they are known only to Allah. 

c (9-2) This expression may mean their inability to give an answer, or that 
they bit their hands by reason of rage, or that they put their hands into the mouths 
of the messengers to silence them. 

d (9-3) The general statements made with regard to the messengers and the 
treatment of their people, in this and the following section, are particularly made 
in reference to the mission of the Prophet Muhammad, the opposition and enmity 
of his people, their turning him out of the city, and their final discomfiture. 



14:11* OPPOSITION IS AT LAST DESTROYED 309 

11 Their messengers said to them: We are nothing but mortals 
like yourselves, but Allah bestows (His) favours on whom He 
pleases of His servants. And it is not for us to bring you an autho- 
rity, except by Allah's permission. And on Allah let the believers 
rely. 12 And why should we not rely on Allah and He has indeed 
guided us in our ways? And we would certainly bear with patience 
your persecution of us. And on Allah should the reliant rely. 

Section 3: Opposition is at last destroyed 

13 And those who disbelieved said to their messengers: We 
will certainly drive you out of our land, unless you come back into 
our religion." So their Lord revealed to them: We shall certainly 
destroy the wrongdoers, 14 and We shall certainly settle you in the 
land after them. This is for him who fears standing in My presence 
and fears My threat. 15 And they sought judgment, and every 
insolent opposer was disappointed: 16 Hell is before him and he is 
given to drink boiling water; 17 he drinks it little by little and is not 
able to swallow it; and death comes to him from every quarter, yet 
he does not die. c And before him is vehement punishment. 

18 The parable of those who disbelieve in their Lord: Their 
works are as ashes on which the wind blows hard on a stormy day. 
They have no power over anything they have earned. That is 
straying far away. 19 Do you not see that Allah created the heavens 
and the earth with truth? If He please, He will take you away and 
bring a new creation, 20 and that is not difficult for Allah. 21 And 
they will all come forth to Allah, then the weak will say to those 
who were proud: We were your followers, can you then avert from 



a (13) This is no doubt equally a description of what the Holy Prophet was 
suffering at the hands of his enemies. 

b (14) This verse contains a very clear prophecy of the flight of the Holy 
Prophet from Makkah and of his re-entry into that city as a conqueror and ruler. 

c (17) He experiences, as it were, the pangs of death, but death, which would 
end all distress, does not come to him. 

d (20) V. 1 8 states that all the exertions of the opponents against the Prophet 
will be useless, while verses 19 and 20 warn the disbelievers that their power will 
come to an end and another people will take their place. 



310 14. ABRAHAM -14:22 

us any of the punishment of Allah? They will say: If Allah had 
guided us, we would have guided you. It is the same to us whether 
we cry or bear patiently; there is no escape for us. 

Section 4: Truth is confirmed 

22 And the devil will say, a when the matter is decided: Surely 
Allah promised you a promise of truth, and I promised you, then 
failed you. And I had no authority over you, except that I called 
you and you obeyed me; so do not blame me but blame your- 
selves. I cannot come to your help, nor can you come to my help. I 
deny your taking me as partner with Allah before. e Surely for the 
unjust is a painful punishment. 

23 And those who believe and do good are made to enter 
Gardens, in which rivers flow, abiding in them by their Lord's 
permission. Their greeting therein is, Peace! 24 Do you not see how 
Allah sets forth a parable of a good word as a good tree, whose 
root is firm and whose branches are high, "yielding its fruit in 



a (22-1) The devil mentioned in this verse is none other than the proud mis- 
leader of the preceding one. Compare also 37:30, where the very words we had no 
authority over you are put into the mouth of the leaders of evil from among man- 
kind. 

b (22-2) Whenever a person is misled into an evil deed, he finds in the end 
that the promise of a good consequence for an evil deed was only a deception. 
Compare 4:120 and 17:64. 

c (22-3) An alternative meaning: is / disbelieved because you took me as 
partner with Allah. In other words, the leaders disbelieve because their followers 
make them think by their flattery that they are worthy of being obeyed and 
followed. 

d (24) The parable likening a good word to a good tree follows immediately 
a description of the final abode of those who do good — Gardens in which rivers 
flow. A good word is like a good tree which gives its fruit in every season, and 
therefore the fruits which a man will find in paradise are only the fruits of his own 
good deeds. The trees of paradise are in fact man's own good deeds, which have 
grown into trees, bearing a fruit which is an embodiment of the spiritual fruits of 
the good deeds of this life. As good deeds are likened to fruit-bearing trees, faith 
is likened to water repeatedly in the Quran, being the source of physical life. It is 
for this reason that, just as the righteous are always spoken of as being those who 
believe and do good, paradise is always described as being a Garden in which 



14 : 26 • MAN'S INJUSTICE IN REJECTING TRUTH 3 1 1 

every season by the permission of its Lord? And Allah sets forth 
parables for people that they may be mindful. 26 And the parable of 
an evil word is as an evil tree pulled up from the earth's surface; it 
has no stability." 27 AUah confirms those who believe with the sure 
word in this world's life and in the Hereafter; and Allah leaves the 
wrongdoers in error; and Allah does what He pleases. 

Section 5: Man's Injustice in rejecting Truth 

28 Do you not see those who change Allah's favour for dis- 
belief e and make their people reach the abode of destruction — 
29 Hell. They will burn in it. And an evil place it is to settle in! 
30 And they set up equals with Allah to lead astray from His path. 
Say: Enjoy yourselves, for surely your return is to the Fire. 

31 Tell My servants who believe to keep up prayer and spend 
(on good works) out of what We have given them, secretly and 
openly, before the coming of the day in which there is no barter- 
ing, nor befriending. 32 Allah is He Who created the heavens and 
the earth and sent down water from the clouds, then brought forth 
with it fruits as a sustenance for you, and He has made the ships 
subservient to you to run their course in the sea by His command, 
and He has made the rivers subservient to you. rf 33 And He has 
made subservient to you the sun and the moon, pursuing their 
courses; and He has made subservient to you the night and the 
day. 34 And He gives you of all that you ask of Him. And if you 

rivers flow, the rivers corresponding to faith and the trees of the Garden corres- 
ponding to the good which a person does. 

a (26) The evil deed is likened to a tree whose roots do not go down into the 
earth, and in whose case, therefore, the process of nutrition must stop. Therefore 
an evil deed does not prosper and cannot bear any fruit. 

b (27) Allah does what He pleases, but it is the wrongdoers only, whom He 
leaves in error. The immediate cause of their going astray is their own iniquity. 

c (28) They reject Allah's favour, the Revelation, which aims at making 
them a great and exalted people, and adopt disbelief in its place. 

d (32) The whole of creation is here, and in the next verse, declared to be 
made subservient to man, to show his high place in creation. How much then does 
man degrade himself by worshipping things which were made to serve him!

man is very unjust, very ungrateful. 

Section 6: Abraham's Prayer 

35 And when Abraham said: My Lord, make this city secure, 
and save me and my sons from worshipping idols. " 36 My Lord, 
surely they have led many people astray.* So whoever follows me, 
he is surely of me; and whoever disobeys me, You surely are For- 
giving, Merciful. c 37 0ur Lord, I have settled a part of my off- 
spring in a valley unproductive of fruit near Your Sacred House, 
our Lord, that they may keep up prayer; so make the hearts of 
some people yearn towards them, and provide them with fruits; 
perhaps they may be grateful. 38 0ur Lord, surely You know what 
we hide and what we proclaim. And nothing is hidden from Allah, 
either in the earth or in the heaven. 

39 Praise be to Allah, Who has given me, in old age, Ishmael 
and Isaac! Surely my Lord is the Hearer of prayer. 40 My Lord, 



a (35) That idolatry received a death-blow from the hands of one of Abra- 
ham's descendants shows that Abraham's prayer was not in vain. 

b (36-1) Idols do not actually lead people astray; the meaning is that it is on 
account of them that people go astray. 

c (36-2) The prayer of Abraham is in fact the prayer of the Holy Prophet and 
illustrates the breadth of his view. Those who follow him are, of course, his own, 
but he does not reject even those who disobey him, for he prays for Allah's mercy 
and protection even for them. 

d (37) According to a Hadith report (Bukhari, 60:9), Abraham brought Hagar 
and Ishmael, and settled them near the ruins of the Sacred House, the Ka'bah. This, 
as the hadith states, was done under a Divine commandment. For when Abraham 
was going back, on leaving them both in this wilderness, where there was no town 
at this time, Hagar asked him, Is it by Allah's commandment that you are doing 
this? Abraham's reply was, Yes. Then said Hagar: "Allah will not leave us to 
perish". It is further stated that, when no water was left with her, Hagar ran to and 
fro, between the Safa and the Marwah, to find out if there was any caravan going 
that way. It was on this occasion that she saw an angel, who pointed to her a place 
where she could find water. This was the place known now as Zamzam. It was 
due to this water that some people settled there. Even the Bible accepts that 
Ishmael's descendants settled in Arabia.

make me keep up prayer and (those) from my offspring (too), our 
Lord, and accept my prayer. 4 iOur Lord, grant me protection and 
my parents and the believers on the day when the reckoning comes 
to pass. 

Section 7: The End of Opposition 

42 And do not think Allah to be heedless of what the unjust 
do. He only gives them respite to a day when the eyes will stare 
(in terror), 43 hastening forward, their heads upraised, their gaze 
not returning to them, and their hearts vacant." 44 And warn people 
of a day when the punishment will come to them, then the wrong- 
doers will say: Our Lord, grant us respite for a short while, we 
will respond to Your call and follow the messengers. Did you not 
swear before, that there will be no passing away for you? 45 And 
you dwell in the abodes of those who wronged themselves, and it 
is clear to you how We dealt with them and We made (them) 
examples for you. 46 And they have indeed planned their plan, and 
their plan is with Allah, though their plan is such that the moun- 
tains should be moved by it. 

47 So do not think that Allah will fail in His promise to His 
messengers. Surely Allah is Mighty, the Lord of retribution. 48 0n

the heavens (as well), c and they will come forth to Allah, the One, 



a (43) The striking of terror into the hearts of those who opposed the Prophet 
was witnessed in this very life, when the Prophet advanced on Makkah. The 
vacancy or blankness of the heart indicates a state of great terror. 

b (46) The reference is to the plan of the Quraish to put an end to the 
Prophet's life, when he was left almost alone in Makkah. The words their plan is 
with Allah signify that their plan is controlled by Allah, Who will make it ineffec- 
tive. A wonderful prophecy indeed in the mouth of a man whose only chance of 
saving himself now lay in escaping from his enemies, while they were taking 
every precaution not to allow him to escape, having decided to put him to death! 

c (48) The transformation wrought by the Holy Prophet no doubt changed 
the earth into a different earth and the heaven into a new heaven. The Arabia at 
the birth of the Prophet was not the Arabia at his death. Beliefs, usages, and prac- 
tices, which had baffled all attempts at reformation for centuries, were swept away, 
and the ignorant, superstitious, and warring tribes had become a single nation,

may be mindful.

was blotted out of existence so completely that no vestige of it could be found 
among a people who had remained addicted to it for centuries. And that great 
change must now come over the whole world. But the spiritual resurrection is 
only an indication of the great day of Resurrection. 

a (49) The powerful opponents of the Prophet were brought before him 
linked together in chains in this very life, at the battle of Badr. These promises 
were fulfilled in this life to show that they were equally true as regards the next. 



Chapter 15 
Ai-mjr The Rock 

This chapter is named The Rock after the Dwellers of the Rock mentioned in 
v. 80, whose fate is a warning to those who sought to kill the Holy Prophet. 
The chapter begins with the grand promise that the Quran shall forever be 
guarded against all corruption and all attempts to annihilate it (v. 9). It goes 
on to declare that evil-doers cannot inflict any injury on the chosen ones of 
God and that the devil's opposition has always failed. Then it gives examples 
of how opponents of previous prophets were destroyed. This chapter was 
revealed at Makkah.

Section 1: The Quran is guarded 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Seer. These are the verses of the Book and 
(of) a Quran that makes clear. 

2 Often will those who disbelieve wish that they were Muslims." 
3 Leave them to eat and enjoy themselves, and let (false) hope be- 
guile them, for they will soon know. 4 And never did We destroy a 
town but it had a decree made known. 5 No people can hasten on 
their doom, nor postpone it. 

6 And they say: Fou, to whom the Reminder is revealed, you 
are indeed mad. 7 Why do you not bring the angels to us, if you are 
truthful? 8 We do not send angels but with truth, and then they 



a (2) The passage does not refer only to life after death. The opponents, who 
thought Islam would soon be annihilated, must no doubt have felt after in life, when 
the truth of Islam became manifest, that it would have been much better for them 
if they had accepted Islam at the first call of the Prophet. 

b (7) The words if you are truthful clearly show that the coming of angels is 
demanded in relation to the fulfilment of prophecies. In the next verse they are 
told that the angels will be sent, in accordance with the requirements of truth and 
justice, when they are required to execute the judgment of the doom of the 
opponents.

would not be given respite. 'Surely We have revealed the Reminder, 
and surely We are its Guardian." 

10 And certainly We sent (messengers) before you among the 
sects of old. n And never did a messenger come to them but they 
mocked him. 12 Thus do We make it enter the hearts of the guilty * 
— 13 they do not believe in it; and the example of the ancients has 
gone before. 14 And even if We open to them a gate of heaven, and 
they keep on ascending into it, 15 they would say: Only our eyes 
have been covered over, rather we are a people under enchant- 
ment^ 

Section 2: Forces of Evil will be destroyed 

16 And certainly We have made strongholds in the heaven, 
and We have made it attractive for the onlookers, 17 and We guard 
it against every accursed devil, 18 but he who steals a hearing; so 
there follows him a visible flame. d 



a (9) This is one of the most wonderful prophecies, whose fulfilment is, and 
will ever remain, a standing testimony to the truth of the Holy Quran, that the Quran 
will for all time be preserved safe against all attempts to destroy it and from every 
kind of corruption. The fulfilment of this prophecy is so evident a fact that a hostile 
writer like Sir William Muir admitted that "there is probably in the world no other 
work which has remained twelve centuries with so pure a text" (The Life of 
Mahomet, 1861, ch. 1). In the whole length and breadth of the Islamic world there 
does not exist a single copy with any variation from the recognized text, and thus 
not only was the Quran preserved from destruction against a powerful enemy, but 
it has also been preserved from corruption. 

b (12) Thus refers to the mockery mentioned in the previous verse. Due to 
their mockery, it enters their hearts not to believe in the Divine message. 

c (15) Verses 14-15 speak of the hardness of their hearts. They were deter- 
mined to reject the truth and did not pay any attention to the clearest evidence. 

d (18) The three verses 16-18 speak of the soothsayers and the diviners, who 
were among the opponents of the Holy Prophet; they pretended to receive 
communications from on high. We are here told that they were really driven from 
the Divine presence, and therefore could not have any access to that source of 
purity. In speaking of the divinations as being followed by a visible flame, it is 
indicated that they meet with failure and disappointment. The description of spiri- 
tual truths in words relating to physical laws prevailing in the world is of common 
occurrence in the Quran. 



15 : 19 • FORCES OF EVIL WILL BE DESTROYED 317 

19 And the earth — We have spread it out and made in it firm 
mountains and caused to grow in it of every suitable thing. 20 And 
We have made in it means of subsistence for you and for those 
(creatures) for whom you do not provide. 21 And there is not a 
thing but with Us are the treasures of it, and We do not send it 
down but in a known measure. 22 And We send the winds fertili- 
zing, then send down water from the clouds," so We give it to you 
to drink; nor is it you who store it up. 23 And surely it is We, Who 
give life and cause death, and We are the Inheritors. 

24 And certainly We know those among you who go forward 
and We certainly know those who lag behind. 25 And surely jour 
Lord will gather them together. He indeed is Wise, Knowing. 

Section 3: The Devil's Opposition to the Righteous 

26 And surely We created man of sounding clay, of black mud 
fashioned into shape. 27 And the jinn, We created before of intensely 
hot fire. 28 And when jour Lord said to the angels: I am going to 



a (22) The fertilizing winds represent the signs of the progress of Islam before 
its final triumph, which is indicated by the rain from the clouds. 

b (23) One who inherits is the one who remains after another has perished. 
The announcement made here is a prophecy that the true worshippers of Allah 
will be heirs in the land while the others will perish. 

c (25) One meaning is that those who are foremost in accepting truth and 
those who lag behind in accepting it will all be gathered together, i.e., ultimately 
those who now lag behind will be brought over to the right course. 

d (27) See also 7:12 footnote. Man's creation from dust also refers to his low 
and humble origin and his temperate nature, as opposed to another kind of crea- 
tion of a fiery nature, which is called the/inn or the devil. The two words, jinn and 
devil, are frequently applied to men of a fiery temperament or rebellious nature 
who lead others to evil. These descriptions of the creation of men and jinn axe, 
allegorical, referring respectively to the nature of those who are submissive to 
Divine laws and those who rebel against them, and the allegory is carried on 
further in what is stated of the rebellion of the devil against Adam. The two des- 
criptions of the origin of man, his being made from clay that gives sound and of 
mud that is fashioned into shape, refer to the two great characteristics which give 
man a superiority over other animals, namely, his use of language and the perfec- 
tion of his make.

create a mortal of sounding clay, of black mud fashioned into shape. 
29 So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My 
spirit," fall down making submission to him. 30 So the angels sub- 
mitted, all of them together — 31 but not IblTs. He refused to be 
with those who submitted. 

32 He said: O IblTs, what is the reason that you are not with 
those who submit? 33 He said: I am not going to submit to a mortal, 
whom You have created of sounding clay, of black mud fashioned 
into shape. 34 He said: Then go forth, for surely you are driven 
away, 35 and surely on you is a curse till the day of Judgment. 36 He 
said: My Lord, grant me respite till the day when they are raised. 
37 He said: Surely you are granted respite, 38 till the day of the time 
made known. 

39 He said: My Lord, as You have judged me to be in error/ 
I shall certainly make (evil) seem good to them on earth, and I 
shall cause them all to deviate, 40 except Your servants from among 
them, the purified ones. 41 He said: This is a right way with Me. 
42 As regards My servants, you have no authority over them except 
such of the deviators as follow you. 43 And surely hell is the pro- 
mised place for them all — 44 it has seven gates. For each gate is 
an appointed portion of them. e 



a (29) This shows that man is made complete when the Divine spirit is 
breathed into him. The Divine spirit (Arabic: riih) does not mean here the animal 
soul in man, but the spirit of Allah that gives him perfection. 

b (36) When a man is raised to life spiritually, the suggestions and the 
promptings of the devil cease to affect him. But until he finds spiritual life, evil 
suggestions mislead him now and then. This is the "time made known" in v. 38. 

c (39) The meaning is clearly "as You have judged me to be in error" and not 
caused me to be in error. 

d (42) In a broad sense all people are servants of Allah. That the devil has no 
authority over them is clear from 14:22, where the devil says to his followers: "I had 
no authority over you, except that I called you and you obeyed me." 

e (44) The seven gates mean the seven ways which lead into it, according to 
which there are seven different names of hell in the Quran. However, the numeral 
seven in Arabic often stands for a large number, so that the meaning may be that 
there are many gates or many ways leading to it.

Section 4: Mercy for the Righteous — Abraham 

45 Surely those who keep their duty are in Gardens and foun- 
tains. 46 Enter them in peace, secure. 47 And We shall remove what- 
ever of bitterness is in their hearts — as brothers, on thrones, facing 
each other. 48 Toil does not afflict them therein, nor will they be 
ejected from there." 49 Inform My servants that I am the Forgiving, 
the Merciful, 50 and that My punishment — that is the painful 
punishment. 

51 And inform them of the guests of Abraham. 52 When they 
came to him, they said, Peace! He said: We are afraid of you. 
53 They said: Do not be afraid, we give you good news of a boy, 
possessing knowledge. 54 He said: Do you give me good news when 
old age has come upon me? Of what then do you give me good 
news? 55 They said: We give you good news with truth, so do not 
be from among the despairing ones. 56 He said: And who despairs 
of the mercy of his Lord except those in error? 

57 He said: What is your business, then, messengers? 58 They 
said: We have been sent to a guilty people, 59 except Lot's follow- 
ers. We shall deliver them all, 60 except his wife: We ordained that 
she shall surely be among those who remain behind. 

Section 5: Lot and Shuaib 

61 So when the messengers came to Lot's followers, 62 he 
said: Surely you are an unknown people. 63 They said: Indeed, we 
have come to you with that about which they disputed. 64 And we 
have come to you with the truth, and we are surely truthful. 



a (48) Such is the Muslim paradise. There is absolute peace of mind, perfect 
security from any inclination to evil or any other danger (v. 46); there is a bro- 
therhood in which no one conceals any rancour in his heart for his brother, nor has 
anyone a complaint against another (v. 47); and lastly, there is neither toil nor fati- 
gue, nor is one to be ever deprived of that state of perfect bliss (v. 48). This verse 
further establishes that those who are once made to enter paradise are not sent 
back to this world; and that therefore the garden in which Adam was at first 
placed was not the paradise of heavenly life, for in that case he would not have 
been ejected from it.

decree, that the roots of these should be cut off in the morning. 

67 And the people of the town came rejoicing. 68 He said: 
These are my guests, so do not disgrace me, 69 and keep your duty 
to Allah and do not shame me. 70 They said: Did we not forbid you 
from (entertaining) people? 71 He said: These are my daughters, if 
you are going to do anything. " 72 By your life! they blindly wan- 
dered on in their frenzy. 73 So the cry overtook them at sunrise; 
74 thus We turned it upside down, and rained upon them stones, as 
decreed. 75 Surely in this are signs for those who take a lesson. 
76 And it is on a road that still abides. 77 Surely in this is a sign for 
the believers.

80 And the dwellers of the Rock indeed rejected the messen- 
gers; 81 and We gave them Our messages, but they turned away 
from them; 82 and they carved houses in the mountains, in security. 
83 So the cry overtook them in the morning; 84 and what they earned 
did not avail them. 

85 And We did not create the heavens and the earth and all 
that is between them but with truth. And the Hour is surely com- 
ing, so turn away with kindly forgiveness. 6 86 Surely your Lord —

Hijaz to Syria.

turn away from those who set up partners (with Allah). 95 Surely

conquest of Makkah, when, having captured the city which had most tyrannically 
driven him out with his followers, and whose people were guilty of shedding the 
innocent blood of the Muslims, he forgave all. 

a (87) The Holy Prophet is reported to have said that the "seven oft-repeated 
verses" were the seven verses of the Fatihah, the first chapter of the Quran. 
(Bukhari, 65:1). According to the same hadith, the Fatihah is called the grand 
Quran. It is so called because it contains the essence of the whole of the Quran. 

b (88) The riches and embellishments of this life had no temptation for the 
Holy Prophet. The unequalled simplicity of his life from the time that he married 
a rich widow to the time that he ruled Arabia may be guessed from the last scene 
of his life, when he ordered the last penny in his house to be given to the poor. 
The verse, moreover, draws a picture of the utmost kindness and gentleness which 
he showed to his followers. The straining of the eyes signifies looking desirously. 

c (99) What is certain is here generally taken to mean death (Bukhari, 
65.15:5), because it is the one thing which is certain to come to every creature. 



Chapter 16 
Ai-NaM The Bee 

This chapter is so named because the bee, guided by its instinct which is called 
"revelation" in 16:68, gathers honey from flowers by taking the best of what 
is in them, producing "a beverage of many colours in which there is healing 
for human beings" (16:69). Similarly, Divine revelation to the Holy Prophet 
collected the best in previous revealed teachings and presented it in the Quran, 
which is also called "a healing" for people (10:57). 

This chapter begins by mentioning the benefits which God has conferred 
upon man in physical nature to show that He also bestows upon him spiritual 
gifts. Those who reject these gifts will come to disgrace but God is slow to 
punish. Revelation is necessary, but not every person can receive it directly. 
The best ones are chosen for it. Revelation teaches the doing of good, and the 
Quran replaces previous revelation. Those who reject it are then compared to 
a flourishing town which is made to suffer because of the ingratitude of its 
people. Lastly, Muslims are given certain golden directions to follow in order 
to be a great nation. This chapter was revealed in the last period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Revelation testified to by Nature 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Allah's commandment will come, so do not seek to hasten 
it. a Glory be to Him, and supremely exalted is He above what they 
set up as partners (with Him)! 2 He sends down angels with reve- 
lation by His command on whom He pleases of His servants, 
saying: Give the warning that there is no God but Me, so keep 
your duty to Me. 3 He created the heavens and the earth with truth. 
Supremely exalted is He above what they set up as partners (with 
Him)! 



a (1) The disbelievers are asked not to hasten the punishment, for Allah, 
Who conferred so many physical benefits on them, and is willing to bestow His 
spiritual gifts, as mercy has the foremost place in Divine nature. This is stated in 
the verses that follow. What that punishment was going to be is expressly stated at 
the end of this chapter (v. 1 12).

16:4« NATURE UPHOLDS UNITY 323 

4 He created man from a small life-germ," and lo! he is an 
open contender. 5 And the cattle, He has created them for you. You 
have in them warm clothing and (other) advantages, and of them 
you eat. 6 And therein is beauty for you, when you drive them back 
(home) and when you send them out (to pasture). 7 And they carry 
your heavy loads to regions which you could not reach but with 
distress to yourselves. Surely your Lord is Compassionate, Merci- 
ful. 8 And (He made) horses and mules and asses that you might 
ride upon them and as an ornament. And He creates what you do 
not know. 9 And upon Allah it rests to show the right way, and there 
are some deviating (ways). And if He please, He would guide all 
of you aright. 

Section 2: Nature upholds Unity 

10 He it is Who sends down water from the clouds for you; it 
gives drink, and by it (grow) the trees on which you feed. n He 
causes to grow for you by it vegetation, and the olives, and the 
date-palms, and the grapes, and all the fruits. Surely there is a sign 
in this for a people who reflect. 12 And He has made subservient to 
you the night and the day and the sun and the moon. And the stars 
are made subservient by His command. Surely there are signs in 
this for a people who understand. 13 And what He has created for 
you in the earth is of varied colours. Surely there is a sign in this 
for a people who are mindful. 14 And He it is Who has made the 
sea subservient that you may eat fresh flesh from it and bring forth 
from it ornaments which you wear. And you see the ships cleaving 
through it, so that you seek of His bounty and that you may give 
thanks. 15 And He has cast firm mountains in the earth in case it 
should quake with you, and rivers and roads that you may go aright,

b (15) These words seem to point to the great upheavals and the violent agita- 
tions which led to the formation of the mountains, before man's existence on earth, 
and, that having been effected, the convulsions are now comparatively insigni- 
ficant, making life possible. But these words can also be translated as meaning 
that they may be a source of benefit to you. In accordance with this we have else- 
where: "And the mountains, He made them firm, a provision for you and for your 
cattle" (79:32-33).

17 Is He then Who creates like him who does not create? Are 
you not then mindful? 18 And if you would count Allah's favours, 
you would not be able to number them. Surely Allah is Forgiving, 
Merciful. 19 And Allah knows what you conceal and what you do 
openly. 20 And those whom they call on besides Allah created 
nothing, while they are themselves created. 21 Dead (are they), not 
living. And they do not know when they will be raised." 

Section 3: Denial due to Ignorance 

22 Your God is one God: so those who do not believe in the 
Hereafter, their hearts refuse to know and they are proud. 
"Undoubtedly Allah knows what they conceal and what they do 
openly. Surely He does not love the proud. 24 And when it is said 
to them, What is it that your Lord has revealed, they say, Stories 
of the ancients! 25 That they may bear their burdens in full on the 
day of Resurrection, and also part of the burdens of those whom 
they lead astray without knowledge. Ah! evil is what they bear. 

Section 4: The Wicked will come to Disgrace 

26 Those before them plotted, so Allah demolished their build- 
ing from the foundations, so the roof fell down on them from 
above them, and the punishment came to them from where they 
did not perceive. 27 Then on the day of Resurrection He will bring 
them to disgrace and say: Where are My partners, for whose sake 
you became hostile? Those who are given the knowledge will say: 
Surely disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers,* 
28 whom the angels cause to die, while they are unjust to them- 
selves. Then would they offer submission: We did not do any evil. 



a (21) These two verses show conclusively that neither Jesus Christ nor any 
other person who is taken for a god ever created anything; and secondly, that 
Jesus was not alive at the time of the revelation of the Quran: Dead are they, not 
living. The further statement that they do not even know when they will be raised, 
shows that the verse speaks of men taken for gods, and at any rate includes them. 

b (27) Disgrace is a sort of hell-fire, which they had in this very life, too. 



16:29* THE WICKED WILL COME TO DISGRACE 325 

Yes! Surely Allah knows what you did. 29 So enter the gates of 
hell, to abide in it. Evil indeed is the dwelling-place of the proud. 

30 And it is said to those who guard against evil: What has 
your Lord revealed? They say, Good. For those who do good in 
this world is good. And certainly the abode of the Hereafter is 
better. And excellent indeed is the abode of those who keep their 
duty — 31 Gardens of perpetuity which they enter, in which rivers 
flow: they have therein what they please. Thus does Allah reward 
those who keep their duty, 32 whom the angels cause to die in 
purity, saying: Peace be on you! enter the Garden for what you 
did. 

33 They only wait that the angels should come to them or that 
your Lord's command should come to pass." Thus did those before 
them. And Allah did not wrong them, but they wronged them- 
selves. 34 So the evil of what they did afflicted them, and what they 
mocked at beset them. 

Section 5: Prophets are raised to explain 

35 And the idolaters say: If Allah pleased we would not have 
served any but Him, (neither) we nor our fathers, nor would we 
have prohibited anything without (order from) Him. Thus did 
those before them. But have the messengers any duty except to 
deliver the message clearly? ° 36 And certainly We raised in every 
nation a messenger, saying: Serve Allah and shun the devil. Then 
some of them Allah guided, and for some of them remaining in

overtook them in the form of famine and war, while the coming to pass of the 
command of the Lord indicates the complete overthrow of their power. 

b (34) The past tense is used to express the highest degree of certainty rela- 
ting to the future. 

c (35) They contended that if Allah did not like evil He could have diverted 
them from evil ways. They are told in reply that Allah's pleasure is not exercised 
by compelling people to adopt one way or the other, but by sending His messen- 
gers in every age and to every nation to point out the right way to the people, and 
by clear messages through His messengers to warn people to avoid evil.

end of the rejectors. 37 If you desire their guidance, yet Allah will 
not guide him who leads (others) astray,* nor do they have any 
helpers. 

38 And they swear by Allah their most energetic oaths: Allah 
will not raise up him who dies. Yes indeed! It is a promise binding 
on Him, quite true, but most people do not know: 39 So that He 
might make clear to them what they differ about, and that those 
who disbelieve might know that they were liars. 40 Our word for a 
thing, when We intend it, is only that We say to it: Be; and it is. 

Section 6: Doom of Opponents is coming 

41 And those who flee for Allah's sake after they are opp- 
ressed, We shall certainly give them a good abode in the 
world; and the reward of the Hereafter is much greater, if only 
they knew c — 42 those who are steadfast and on their Lord they 
rely.

not know — 44 with clear arguments and Scriptures. And We 



a (36) There were some people who did not care for the Prophet's warning 
and adhered to error. Justice therefore required that they should be left in error. 
The message was sent by God; the choice was man's own to accept or reject it. 
The words do not mean that Allah had foredoomed some people, for then the 
sending to them of messengers would have been absurd. 

b (37) Those who not only walk in error themselves, but have grown so hos- 
tile to the cause of Truth that they mislead others, cannot find the right way, how- 
ever much the Prophet may be anxious for them. 

c (41) Here is a clear prophecy regarding those Muslims who had to flee their 
homes on account of the persecutions of the Quraish. They are promised not only 
a reward of the Hereafter but a good abode in this world, too. Those who fled their 
homes in utter helplessness, and were in danger of their very lives, were given the 
clearest promise of a great future in this life, and this promise proved true despite 
the hard struggle of a powerful nation to exterminate Islam.

and the Christians, to whom the disbelievers of the Quraish are referred. But the

people what has been revealed to them, and that perhaps they may 
reflect. 

45 Are they, then, who plan evil (plans), secure that Allah will 
not humble them in the earth, or that punishment will not come 
upon them from where they do not perceive? 46 0r that He will not 
seize them in their going to and fro, then they will not be able to 
escape? 47 0r that He will not seize them with a gradual reduc- 
tion?" Your Lord is surely Compassionate, Merciful. 48 Do they not 
see everything that Allah has created? Its (very) shadows return 
from right and left, making submission to Allah, while they are in 
utter humility. 49 And to Allah submits every living creature that is 
in the heavens and that is in the earth, and the angels (too) and they 
are not proud. 50 They fear their Lord above them and do what they 
are commanded. 

Section 7: Human Nature revolts against Polytheism 

51 And Allah has said: Do not take two gods. He is only one 
God: So Me alone should you fear. 52 And whatever is in the 
heavens and the earth is His, and to Him is obedience due always. 
Will you then fear other than Allah? 53 And whatever good you 
have, it is from Allah; then, when evil afflicts you, to Him do you 
cry for aid. 54 Then when He removes the evil from you, lo! some 
of you set up partners with their Lord, 55 so as to deny what We 
have given them. Then enjoy yourselves, for soon will you know. 
56 And they set apart for what they do not know, a portion of what 

mention in the very next verse of the Reminder being sent to the Holy Prophet 
shows that the words apply to the Muslims. Some commentators take the words 
generally as meaning learned men. 

a (47) As verses 41 — 42 speak of a prosperous future for those who accepted 
the truth and now were suffering the severest persecutions, verses 45^47 speak 
prophetically of the different forms of punishment to which the persecutors of the 
righteous were to be subjected, v. 47 stating that they would be reduced gradually. 
This was their end, as their power went on waning till the whole of Arabia bowed 
before Islam. 

b (56) That is, for the idols or their gods, whom they ignorantly take for 
intercessors.

about what you forged. 

57 And they ascribe daughters to Allah. Glory be to Him! 
And for themselves is what they desire! 58 And when the birth of a 
daughter is announced to one of them, his face becomes dark and 
he is full of wrath. 59 He hides himself from the people because of 
the evil of what is announced to him. Shall he keep it with disgrace 
or bury it (alive) in the dust? Now surely evil is what they judge!" 
60 For those who do not believe in the Hereafter are evil attributes 
and Allah's are the sublime attributes. And He is the Mighty, the 
Wise. 

Section 8: Wrongdoing of Deniers 

61 And if Allah were to destroy people for their wrongdoing, 
He would not leave on it a single creature, but He gives them res- 
pite till an appointed time. So when their doom comes they cannot 
postpone it an hour, nor (can they) bring it forward. 62 And they 
ascribe to Allah what they (themselves) hate,' and their tongues 
relate the lie that for them is good. Assuredly for them is the Fire, 
and they will be abandoned (in it). 63 By Allah! We certainly sent 
(messengers) to nations before you, but the devil made their deeds 
seem good to them. So he is their patron today, and for them is a 
painful punishment. 64 And We have not revealed to you the Book 
except that you may make clear to them what they differ about, 
and (as) a guidance and a mercy for a people who believed 65 And 



a (59) The allusion is to the barbarous custom of burying daughters alive, 
which was prevalent among the Arabs, especially among their chiefs. Its abolition 
was one of the numerous blessings of Islam. With no physical or administrative 
power behind it to ensure its enforcement, the word of Allah swept away this 
deep-rooted custom as if by a magician's wand, so that not a single case of the 
burial of a living girl ever occurred after the mandate came. Attention is drawn to 
the inconsistency of their avowed beliefs with their inward convictions in v. 62. 

b (62) The reference is to their ascribing daughters to Allah, while they 
themselves did not like to have a daughter, thus showing how obviously inconsis- 
tent with their inward convictions was their professed belief in the Divine Being. 

c (64) The previous verse shows that the whole world was in the grip of the 



16 : 66 • PARABLES SHOWING TRUTH OF REVELATION 329 

Allah sends down water from above, and with it gives life to the 
earth after its death." Surely there is a sign in this for a people who 
listen. 

Section 9: Parables showing Truth of Revelation 

66 And surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle: We give 
you to drink of what is in their bellies — from between the faeces 
and the blood — pure milk, agreeable to the drinkers. 67 And of the 
fruits of the palms and the grapes, you obtain from them intoxi- 
cants and goodly provision. There is surely a sign in this for a 
people who ponder. 

68 And jour Lord revealed to the bee: Make hives in the moun- 
tains and in the trees and in what they build, 69 then eat of all the 
fruits and walk in the ways of jour Lord submissively. From their 

devil at the advent of the Prophet. Messengers were sent to all nations before the 
coming of the Prophet, but as time passed, the followers of the messengers, ins- 
tead of following their teachings, followed evil ways, which gradually appeared to 
them so beautiful that the good of this world was all in all for them. This verse 
shows that the teachings of the previous prophets had been distorted to such an 
extent that a new Prophet was now needed to lead them aright. Truth could not 
now be discovered without light from heaven. It also establishes that the new 
Prophet's message was for the followers of all religions; in other words, for the 
whole world. 

a (65) The water from heaven is the Divine revelation, the death of the earth 
is its corruption, and the giving of life signifies its spiritual awakening, marvellous 
signs of which had already appeared in Arabia. 

b (67) Verses 66 and 67 compare the Divine laws as manifested in nature 
with the handiwork of man. Divine law in nature produces such a valuable and 
agreeable diet as pure milk, separating it from the other elements — blood and 
dung — to which food is reduced in the belly of an animal, which the hand of 
man is unable to do. On the other hand, the most agreeable provisions produced 
by nature in the form of fruits are turned into such a poisonous drug as alcohol by 
the hand of man. The two illustrations thus point out that just as Divine laws 
working in the physical world produce the purest and most agreeable diets, sepa- 
rating them from obnoxious elements and useless excrements, so their working in 
the spiritual world produces the most sublime moral teachings, which afford to 
man the purest spiritual diet. But the best teachings given by Divine revelation are 
likely to be corrupted by the hands of man, as the best of fruits is turned into such 
an obnoxious thing as alcohol.

bellies comes forth a beverage of many colours, in which there is 
healing for man. Surely in this there is a sign for a people who 
reflect." 70 And Allah creates you, then He causes you to die; and 
some of you are brought back to the worst part of life, knowing 
nothing after having knowledge. Surely Allah is Knowing, 
Powerful. 

Section 10: The Recipient of Revelation 

71 And Allah has made some of you excel others in the means 
of subsistence; so those who are made to excel do not give away 
their sustenance to those whom their right hands possess, so that 
they may be equal in it. Will they then deny the favour of Allah? c 



a (69) This is another illustration to show that Divine revelation brings about 
an object which cannot be effected by human exertions. The bee gathers the sweet 
juice of different flowers, making it into honey. What this small creature effects, 
working instinctively in obedience to Divine laws, cannot be effected by the com- 
bined exertions of the whole of humanity. This illustration shows a similar work- 
ing of the Divine laws in the spiritual world, viz., that the Prophet, working, as it 
were, instinctively in obedience to the Divine laws prevailing in the spiritual world, 
collects by Divine revelation all that is best and noblest in any religion, and sums 
it up in the Quran: a work which could not be effected by human exertion. 

It should be noted that five kinds of the wahy (revelation) of Allah are men- 
tioned in the Quran: a revelation to inanimate objects, as the earth (99:5) or the 
heavens (41:12); a revelation to living creatures other than man, as the bee; a 
revelation to the angels (8:12); a revelation to men and women other than prophets, 
as the apostles of Jesus (5:111) or the mother of Moses (28:7); and a revelation to 
prophets and messengers. All these kinds of wahy are not identical; in the case of 
the bee, it is its very instinct that is a revelation to it. The revelation to the prophets 
is the expression of Divine will for the guidance of people. 

b (70) As in individuals, so in nations. Those who had been given knowledge 
of Divine revelation before the Holy Prophet had lost or corrupted it at the time of 
his advent; hence the necessity for a new Divine revelation. 

c (71) This provides an answer to the demand of the disbelievers expressly 
stated elsewhere: "We will not believe till we are given the like of what Allah's 
messengers are given" (6:124). It is pointed out that, as there are differences in the 
physical world, so there are differences in the spiritual world. All persons are not 
equally fit to receive the gift of Divine revelation. The favour of Allah, which is 
the Divine revelation, should not be denied simply because all individuals are not 
equal recipients of it. 



1 6 : 72 • THE RECIPIENT OF REVELATION 331 

72 And Allah has made wives for you from among yourselves," and 
has given you sons and daughters from your wives, and has pro- 
vided you with good things. Will they then believe in falsehood 
and deny the favour of Allah? 

73 And they serve besides Allah that which controls for them 
no sustenance at all from the heavens and the earth; nor have they 
any power. 74 So do not coin likenesses for Allah. Surely Allah 
knows and you do not know. 75 Allah sets forth a parable: There is 
a slave, the property of another, controlling nothing, and there is 
one to whom We have granted from Ourselves a goodly provision, 
so he spends from it (on good works) secretly and openly. Are the 
two alike? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know. e 
76 And Allah sets forth a parable of two men: One of them dumb, 
controlling nothing, and he is a burden to his master; wherever he 
sends him, he brings no good. Is he equal with him who enjoins 
justice, and he is on the right path? 



a (72-1) The statement made here is that for all men wives are created from 
their anfus (plural of nafs, meaning soul or self). No one ever interprets these 
words in the erroneous way in which similar words about Adam are misinter- 
preted, where the rib is made to take the place of soul or self. The words of the 
Quran do not allow this unnatural interpretation, which is based upon the story of 
Genesis. 

b (72-2) They believe in the superstition that the idols, which are inanimate 
objects, can intercede with Allah, and deny the favour of Allah (i.e. Divine revela- 
tion) being granted to a human being. Hence the next verse speaks of the idols. 

c (75) By slave is meant the idol-worshipper who, instead of being master of 
idols, stones, and such-like objects, as Allah has created him to be, chooses to 
become a slave to them, bows before them, and considers them more powerful 
than himself. By the master of the goodly provision from Allah is meant the recip- 
ient of the Divine revelation, i.e., the Prophet. The comparison is made to show 
that the idol- worshippers will ultimately find themselves deprived of all power. 

d (76) This parable makes the same comparison as the previous one. The 
purport is here made clearer. The master of the goodly provision from Allah of the 
previous verse is here plainly called the enjoiner of justice and the one who is on 
the right path, while the idol-worshipper is the one who is not able to do anything 
and who remains unsuccessful in whatever he undertakes — a prophetical allu- 
sion to the defeats and discomfiture of the idolaters.

Section 1 1 : Punishment withheld 

77 And Allah's is the unseen of the heavens and the earth. 
And the matter of the Hour is but as a twinkling of the eye or it is 
nearer still. a Surely Allah is Powerful over all things. 78 And Allah 
brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers — you knew 
nothing — and He gave you hearing and sight and hearts that you 
might give thanks. 

79 Do they not see the birds, constrained in the middle of the 
sky? None withholds them but Allah. Surely there are signs in 
this for a people who believe. 80 And Allah has given you an abode 
in your houses, and He has given you houses of the skins of cattle, 
which you find light to carry on the day of your march and on the 
day of your halting, and of their wool and their fur and their hair, 
household stuff and a provision for a time. 81 And Allah has made 
for you, out of what He has created, shelters, and He has given 
you in the mountains, places of retreat, and He has given you 
garments to save you from the heat^ and (protective) garments to 
save you in your fighting. Thus does He complete His favour to 
you that you may submit. 82 Then if they turn away, your duty is 
only to deliver the message clearly. 83 They recognize the favour of 
Allah, yet they deny it, and most of them are ungrateful. 



a (77) By the unseen is meant the knowledge of the unseen, or the knowledge 
of the eventual fulfilment of the prophecies; and by the Hour is meant the hour of 
the doom of the opponents of the Prophet, the hour when their power was to be 
utterly destroyed. 

b (79) Both Arab proverb and Arab poetry bear witness to birds being spoken 
of as attending a victorious army to feed upon the corpses of the enemy left on the 
battlefield. In withholding the birds, therefore, there may be a reference to with- 
holding the punishment which must ultimately overtake the enemy. 

c (81-1) The mention of one of two contrary things always involves the other. 
Hence by the preservation from heat spoken of here, preservation from heat and 
cold alike is meant. 

d (81-2) As He has given you of the good things of this life, the physical 
blessings, He now completes these blessings by giving you the greatest of His 
blessings, i.e., Divine revelation, so that, submitting to it, you may prosper.

Section 12: Prophets testify 

84 And on the day when We raise up a witness out of every

disbelievers, nor will they be allowed to make amends. 85 And 
when the wrongdoers see the punishment, it will not be lightened 
for them, nor will they be given respite. 86 And when those who set 
up partners (with Allah) see their associate-gods, they will say: 
Our Lord, these are our associate-gods on whom we called besides 
You. But they will throw back at them the word: Surely you are 
liars. 87 And they will tender submission to Allah on that day, and 
what they used to forge will fail them. 

88 Those who disbelieve and hinder (people) from Allah's way, 
We will add punishment to their punishment because they made 
mischief. 89 And on the day when We raise up in every people a 
witness against them from among themselves, and bring you as a 
witness against these. And We have revealed the Book to you 
explaining all things/ and a guidance and mercy and good news

Section 13: Revelation enjoins Good 

90 Surely Allah commands (the doing of) justice and the 
doing of good (to others) and the giving to the near of kin, and He 
forbids indecency and evil and rebellion. He instructs you that you 
may be mindful.'' 91 And fulfil the covenant of Allah, when you have 



a (84) In this verse, as well as in the concluding verse (v. 89) of this section, 
the broad humanitarian doctrine is taught that a prophet has been raised in every 
nation. There are religions which claim hundreds of prophets for a single nation, 
like the house of Israel, but grudge even a single true prophet to other vast coun- 
tries and nations. Islam rejects all such narrow views of the spiritual providence of 
Allah, Who is not the "Lord God of Israel", but the Lord of all nations. 

b (89-1) By these are meant the Muslim community throughout the world 
and in all ages. 

c (89-2) By everything is meant every basic principle necessary for the spiri- 
tual welfare of man. The sunnah, the practice of the Prophet, as illustrating the 
precepts of the Quran, supplies the details. 

d (90) This verse deals with the different degrees of goodness and evil. The

firm, and you have indeed made Allah your surety. Surely Allah 
knows what you do. 

92 And do not be like her who unravels her yarn, disinteg- 
rating it into pieces, after she has spun it strongly." You make your 
oaths to be means of deceit between you because (one) nation is 
more numerous than (another) nation. Allah only tries you by 
this. And He will certainly make clear to you on the day of 
Resurrection what you differed about. 93 And if Allah please, He 
would make you a single nation, but He leaves in error whom He 
pleases and guides whom He pleases. And certainly you will be 
questioned as to what you did. 94 And do not make your oaths a 
means of deceit between you, so that a foot should slip after its 
stability, and you should taste evil because you hinder (people) 
from Allah's way and severe punishment be your (lot). 95 And do 
not take a small price for Allah's covenant. Surely what is with 
Allah is better for you, if only you knew! 96 What is with you 
passes away and what is with Allah is enduring. And We shall 

lowest form of goodness is justice or returning good for good, and includes not 
only justice proper but also the fulfilment of all duties and obligations. A higher 
degree of goodness is, however, that which is called ihsan, or goodness proper, the 
doing of good without having received any benefit. The last stage of goodness is 
that in which a person's nature is so inclined to good that he does good to all people 
as an ordinary man does good to his own near of kin. In fact, he looks upon the 
whole of humanity as his kindred. 

Similarly, this verse deals with the three degrees of evil: the merest indecency 
which may not affect the rights of others, evil actions which affect the rights of 
other individuals, and oppression or rebellion affecting the rights of large numbers, 
nations or states. 

a (92-1) People, after accepting the truth, are united by certain ties, but when 
this union brings about strength, they destroy it with their own hands. It was unity 
which made the Muslims rise to great power, but that unity today lies in ruins, and 
the strong community of Islam is like the unravelled yarn of a crazy spinner. 

b (92-2) Faithfulness to covenants is here stressed and, from the covenant 
with God, the subject is diverted to covenants between people. Attention is drawn 
in the words, you make your oaths to be means of deceit between you, to the 
conditions generally prevailing in the world, to the breach of covenants between 
nations, which is ruining the stability of human society. 



16:97" THE QURAN IS NOT A FORGERY 335 

certainly give to those who are patient their reward for the best of 
what they did. 97 Whoever does good, whether male or female, " 
and is a believer, We shall certainly make him live a good life, 
and We shall certainly give them their reward for the best of what 
they did. 

98 So when you recite the Quran, seek refuge in Allah from 
the accursed devil. "Surely he has no authority over those who 
believe and rely on their Lord. 100 His authority is only over those 
who befriend him and those who set up partners with Him. 

Section 14: The Quran is not a Forgery 

101 And when We change a message for a message — and 
Allah knows best what He reveals — they say: 7ou are only a 
forger. Rather, most of them do not know. 102 Say: The Holy 
Spirit has revealed it from jour Lord with truth, c that it may estab- 
lish those who believe, and as a guidance and good news for those 
who submit. 103 And indeed We know that they say: Only a mortal 
teaches him. The tongue of him whom they hint at is foreign, and 
this is clear Arabic language. 104 Those who do not believe in 



a (97) The doers of good, both men and women, are made to lead a good life 
in this world and will have a reward in the Hereafter. 

b (101) It is not the change of the Quranic verses that is spoken of here; it is 
the change of the previous messages sent through former prophets for the message 
of the Holy Quran. This chapter belongs to Makkah, and the upholders of abro- 
gation have never asserted that any verse was abrogated while the Holy Prophet 
was at Makkah. Moreover, it was the revelation of the Quran itself that was called 
a forgery, and not an occasional change that any of its commandments could have 
undergone, with which change the disbelievers had, in fact, no concern. See also 
2:106 footnote. 

c (102) The Holy Spirit (Ruh al-qudus) is here stated to be the bearer of the 
revelation to the Holy Prophet; elsewhere the same bearer is called al-Ruh al- 
Arriin, or the Faithful Spirit (26: 193), and the same is called Gabriel in 2:97. 

d (103) Various names have been suggested as to the person whom the 
opponents of the Prophet referred to. These are mostly the names of Christian 
slaves, who were not Arabs. All these slaves were among the early converts to 
Islam, who were most cruelly persecuted by the Quraish, yet they remained firm 
under the severest tortures. Is it possible that they, without being in the least

Allah's messages, Allah does not guide them, and for them is a 
painful punishment. 105 Only they forge lies who do not believe in 
Allah's messages, and they are the liars." 

106 Whoever disbelieves in Allah after his belief — not he 
who is compelled while his heart is content with faith, but he who 
opens (his) breast for disbelief — they incur Allah's displeasure, 
and for them is a grievous punishment. 107 That is because they 
love this world's life more than the Hereafter, and because Allah 
does not guide the disbelieving people. 108 These are they whose 
hearts and ears and eyes Allah has sealed and these are the heed- 
less ones. c 109 No doubt that in the Hereafter they are the losers. 
110 Then surely your Lord, to those who flee after they are persecu- 
ted, then struggle hard and are patient, surely jour Lord after that 
is Protecting, Merciful. 

Section 15: Fate of the Opponents 

111 On the day when every soul will come pleading for itself, 

gainers, should have thus willingly suffered persecutions for a cause which they 
knew to be false? This is sufficient to show the absurdity of the allegation, and it 
is to this that v. 105 refers. They certainly cannot be supposed to have been the 
authors of the sublime themes of the Holy Quran. 

a (105) The reference is to v. 103. The allegation was that certain slaves 
taught the Prophet. How could a forger of lies be a believer, especially when he 
had to undergo the severest trials for its sake. 

b (106) Only very rare instances are met with in the early history of Islam in 
which converts even under compulsion ever recanted. 

c (108) Allah does not seal the hearts of people and thus hinder them from 
accepting the truth; it is they who reject the truth, turning a deaf ear to the preach- 
ing of the Prophet, as the previous verses show. Nor are the hearts sealed forever, 
for, as v. 110 shows, even after that Allah forgives them, if they repent and show 
perseverance. 

rf(110) The struggle (jihad) spoken of here is certainly not in connection 
with fighting, for the verse was revealed at Makkah. Note also that God is spoken 
of here as being Ghaffir, translated as Protecting, to those who flee from their 
homes on account of persecution and then struggle hard to establish Truth. God 
being Ghafiir here is in relation to His exalting them by protecting them from the 
commission of sins, not forgiving of sins, for it is their acts of sacrifice that are 
spoken of here, not their sins. 



16:112' FATE OF THE OPPONENTS 337 

and every soul will be paid in full what it has done, and they will 
not be dealt with unjustly. 112 And Allah sets forth a parable: A town 
safe and secure, to which its means of subsistence came in abun- 
dance from every quarter; but it disbelieved in Allah's favours, so 
Allah made it taste a pall of hunger and fear because of what they 
did." 113 And certainly a Messenger came to them from among 
them, but they rejected him, so the punishment caught them while 
they were wrongdoers. 

114 So eat of what Allah has given you, lawful and good 
(things), and give thanks for Allah's favour, if He it is you serve. 
n5 He has forbidden you only what dies of itself and blood and the 
flesh of swine and that on which any other name than that of Allah 
has been invoked; but whoever is driven to (it), not desiring nor 
exceeding the limit, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.* 
116 And do not utter the lie which your tongues describe: This is 
lawful and this unlawful; so that you forge a lie against Allah. 
Surely those who forge a lie against Allah will not prosper. 117 A 
little enjoyment — and for them is a painful punishment. 118 And 
to those who are Jews We prohibited what We have related to you 
already, and We did not wrong them, but they wronged them- 
selves. 119 And surely jour Lord, for those who do evil in igno- 
rance, then turn after that and make amends, surely jour Lord 
after that is Forgiving, Merciful. 



a (112) The parable is set forth to depict the state of Makkah as it was before 
the time of the Holy Prophet and, prophetically, its fate after he was rejected, after 
it disbelieved in Allah 's favours. Its first condition was one of great prosperity and 
affluence, as referred to in 106:3 — 4. When the Prophet and his followers were 
persecuted and tortured, a famine overtook them, which destroyed everything, till 
they ate skins and dead animals. This was the pall of hunger, spoken of here. But, 
even then, they did not stop persecution and tried to exterminate Islam by the 
sword. The result was that all their attacks on Madinah failed, and ultimately 
Makkah itself lay powerless when attacked by the Prophet. This was the pall of 
fear, being so called because no blood was shed.

338 16. THE BEE • 16 : 120 

Section 16: The Way to Greatness 

120 Surely Abraham was a model (of virtue), obedient to Allah, 
upright, and he was not from among the idolaters, 121 grateful for 
His favours. He chose him and guided him on the right path. 
122 And We gave him good in this world; and in the Hereafter he is 
surely among the righteous. 

123 Then We revealed to you: Follow the faith of Abraham, 
the upright one; and he was not from among the idolaters. 124 The 
Sabbath was ordained only against those who differed about it." 
And surely your Lord will judge between them on the day of 
Resurrection in that in which they differed. 

125 Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly 
exhortation, and argue with them in the best manner. Surely your 
Lord knows best him who strays from His path, and He knows 
best those who go aright. 126 And if you take your turn, then 
retaliate with the like of what you were afflicted with. c But if you 
show patience, it is certainly best for the patient. 127 And be patient 
and your patience is not but by (the help of) Allah, and do not 
grieve for them, nor be in distress by what they plan. 128 Surely 
Allah is with those who keep their duty and those who do good (to 
others). 



a (124) The meaning here seems to be that the Sabbath, the Jewish day of 
worship which should have made them walk in the footsteps of righteous Abraham, 
was turned against them because of their violation of it. Or, the statement is made 
to show that it was not necessary for the Muslims to observe a day of worship, as 
even Abraham, a model of virtue for both the Jews and the Muslims, did not 
observe a particular day of worship. 

b (125) The principle laid down for preaching and religious controversy by 
the Quran has yet to be learned by the most advanced people. It shows the breadth 
of mind of the Holy Prophet, more especially when it is remembered that the 
injunction was given at a time when Muslims were being most severely perse- 
cuted and there was the greatest reason for adopting a harsh attitude. 

c (126) Muslims were being persecuted most cruelly, and they were told that 
the time would come when they would dominate their erstwhile persecutors. In 
that case they are allowed to punish them for their guilt, but it is twice added, here 
and in v. 127, that they should show patience when they had the upper hand and 
do good even to their enemies, for Allah is with those who do good (v. 128). 



Chapter 17 
Bamisra'ii The Israelites 

This chapter opens and ends by referring to the history of the Israelites, who, 
after attaining to greatness, were twice punished for their misdeeds. It begins 
with a mention of the Mi 'raj or ascension of the Holy Prophet, indicative of 
the eminence to which the Muslims would rise. It then warns Muslims of the 
fate which befell the Israelites, as the same fate was to befall them. Then it goes 
on to deal with the following subjects: every deed must have a consequence, 
the moral teachings Muslims must follow to do good deeds, opposition to the 
truth and to the righteous, and its defeat by the truth — that "truth" being the 
Holy Prophet himself who is the "spirit of truth" prophesied in the Gospel of 
John — the Quran being a miracle, and, finally, Moses' warning to Pharaoh, 
a warning like it now being given by the Quran to its opponents. This chapter 
was revealed in the early period at Makkah, around the fifth year of the Holy 
Prophet's mission. 



Section 1 : Israelites punished Twice 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 



£ 1 Glory be to Him Who carried His servant by night from the

a (1) The carrying by night of the Holy Prophet Muhammad from the Sacred 
Mosque at Makkah to the Remote Mosque at Jerusalem (known as Isrd ') is in 
reference to the Prophet's reported Ascension (known as Mi 'raj). Isrd' was the 
first stage in Mi 'raj, as before his Ascension to heaven, the Prophet was taken to 
the Remote Mosque, or the Temple at Jerusalem. The Ascension was not a trans- 
lation of the body, but the spiritual experience of the Holy Prophet, as is shown in 
v. 60 where it is expressly called a vision. As the significance of the Ascension 
was the spiritual eminence of the Holy Prophet and indicated his triumph in the 
world, his being carried to the Temple at Jerusalem signified that he would also 
inherit the blessings of the Israelite prophets.

Children of Israel (saying): Take no guardian beside Me a — 
3 (you) the offspring of those whom We bore with Noah. Surely he 
was a grateful servant. 4 And We made known to the Children of 
Israel in the Book: Certainly you will make mischief in the land 
twice, and behave insolently with mighty arrogance. ' 5 So when 
the first warning of the two came to pass, We raised against you 
Our servants, of mighty prowess, so they made havoc in (your) 
houses. And it was an accomplished threat. 'Then We gave you 
back the turn against them, and aided you with wealth and chil- 
dren and made you a numerous band. c 7 If you do good, you do 
good for your own souls. And if you do evil, it is for them. So 
when the second warning came, (We raised another people) that 
they might bring you to grief and that they might enter the Mosque 
as they entered it the first time, and that they might destroy, what- 
ever they conquered, with utter destruction/ 8 It may be that your 
Lord will have mercy on you. And if you return (to mischief), We 



a (2) The first verse really prophesies a great future for Islam and the 
Muslims, while this warns them of the pitfalls of greatness, citing the instance of a 
nation that had been made to rise to eminence before them. 

b (4) Jerusalem was destroyed twice as a punishment for the transgressions 
of the Jews, once by the Babylonians, and again by the Romans. See Jesus' 
warning in Matthew 23:38 and Luke 21:24 and various other like references. The 
Psalms are also replete with warnings. 

c (6) V. 5 relates the destruction of the Temple at Jerusalem and the murder, 
imprisonment, and banishment of the Jews by the Babylonians in the year 588 B.C., 
while v. 6 relates to the return of the Jews and rebuilding of the temple under 
Zerubbabel, and to their subsequent prosperity. 

d (7) This verse describes the destruction of the Temple a second time, 
which was accomplished by the Romans under Titus. There is a prophetical 
reference here to the history of the Muslims. The Caliphate of Islam was des- 
troyed twice, first by the Mongols under Hulagu in 656 A.H. (1258 C.E.), and 
again by the powers of Europe after the First World War. But while in the case of 
the Israelites their spiritual centre was laid waste on both occasions, the spiritual 
centre of Islam, the Ka'bah, has remained intact on both occasions under a Divine 
promise. Following the first great reverse in Muslim history in 1258, Islam gained 
spiritual conquests in the coming over to Islam en masse of the Mongols and 
Turks. After the second reverse, the afflictions of Islam are giving birth to a spiri- 
tual resuscitation of the world. On both occasions, there has been a revival of its 
temporal power as well. 



17:9" EVERY DEED HAS A CONSEQUENCE 341 

will return (to punishment)." And We have made hell a prison for 
the disbelievers. 

9 Surely this Quran guides to what is most upright, and gives 
good news to the believers who do good that theirs is a great 
reward, 10 and that those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We 
have prepared for them a painful punishment. 

Section 2: Every Deed has a Consequence 

11 And man prays for evil as he ought to pray for good; and 
man is ever hasty. 12 And We made the night and the day two 
signs, then We have made the sign of the night to pass away and 
We have made the sign of the day manifest, so that you may seek 
grace from your Lord, and that you may know the numbering of 
years and the reckoning. And We have explained everything 
distinctly. 13 And We have made every human being's actions to 
cling to his neck, and We shall bring forth to him on the day 
of Resurrection a book which he will find wide open.^ 14 Read 
your book. Your own soul is sufficient as a reckoner against you 
this day. 15 Whoever goes aright, goes aright only for the good of 
his own soul; and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to 
its detriment. And no bearer of a burden can bear the burden 



a (8) This relates to the advent of the Holy Prophet Muhammad, when the 
Israelites were again given a chance to reform, but they are told that if they return 
to mischief they will again be punished. 

b (12) The night stands for the darkness of ignorance and unbelief (see 
2:257), and the passing away of the night indicates that ignorance will vanish and 
the light of Islam will take its place. Arabia witnessed this sign in the seventh cen- 
tury C.E., and Islam has since then been gradually advancing in the world. 

c (13) This verse reveals the principle that every action produces an effect 
which is made to cling to a person, and that this very effect will be met with on 
the day of Resurrection in the form of a wide open book. It is thus by leaving its 
effect behind that every action is recorded, and this very effect constitutes the 
book of a person's actions. Clinging to the neck indicates the inseparability of one 
thing from another, thus establishing the law of cause and effect. 

d (14) This verse throws a flood of light on the nature of the reckoning on 
the day of Resurrection, showing clearly that it is nothing but a complete manifes- 
tation of the effects of the deeds done in this life. 



342 17. THE ISRAELITES • 17 : 16 

of another." Nor do We punish until We raise a messenger. 

16 And when We wish to destroy a town, We send command- 
ments to its people who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; 
thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter 
destruction/ 17 And how many generations did We destroy after 
Noah! And your Lord is sufficient as being Aware and Seer of His 
servants' sins. 18 Whoever desires this transitory life, We hasten to 
him in it what We please for whomsoever We desire, then We 
assign to him hell; he will enter it despised, driven away. 19 And 
whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it with due striving 
and is a believer — those are they whose striving is amply 
rewarded. 20 A11 do We aid — these as well as those — out of the 
bounty of your Lord, and the bounty of your Lord is not limited. 

21 See how We have made some of them to excel others. And 
certainly the Hereafter is greater in degrees and greater in excellence. 
22 Do not set up any other god with Allah, or you will sit down 
despised, forsaken. 

Section 3: Moral Precepts 

23 And your Lord has decreed that you serve none but Him, 
and do good to parents. If either or both of them reach old age 



a (15-1) This verse strikes at the root of the doctrine of atonement. The burden 
of the sins of one person cannot be taken away by another, for, as already stated, 
the effect of each man's actions clings to himself. 

b (15-2) Here it is stated that guidance is offered to man through a messen- 
ger of God, but if he still persists in error and strays from the path, it is to his own 
detriment. And then it is added that the punishment of the Hereafter is only after 
man has been warned through a Divine messenger. The law as to punishment in 
this world is stated in v. 16, which speaks of the destruction of towns, for such 
punishment is sent when tyranny and transgression assume extraordinary propor- 
tions, and punishment is then inflicted on large numbers. 

c (16) Allah does not command people to transgress. The meaning is clear: 
Allah sends them commandments to do good, pointing out the right way through 
His prophets, but as they are accustomed to lead easy lives, they transgress those 
commandments, and are therefore punished. 

d (23) Doing good to parents is placed next to submission to Allah, for 
among fellow-beings none has a greater claim upon a person than his parents. 



17 : 24 • MORAL PRECEPTS 343 

with you, say no word to them showing annoyance, nor rebuke 
them, and speak to them a generous word. 24 And make yourself 
gentle to them with humility out of mercy, and say: My Lord, have 
mercy on them, as they brought me up (when I was) little. 

25 Your Lord knows best what is in your minds. If you are 
righteous, He is surely Forgiving to those who turn (to Him). 
26 And give to the near of kin his due and (to) the needy and the 
traveller, and do not squander wastefully. 27 Surely the squanderers 
are the devil's brethren. And the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord." 
28 And if you (have to) turn away from them (in order) to seek 
mercy from jour Lord that you hope for, then speak to them a 
gentle word.* 29 And do not make your hand to be chained to your 
neck, nor stretch it forth to its fullest extension, so that you sit down 
blamed, stripped off. c 30 Surely your Lord amplifies provision for 
whom He pleases, and restricts (it also). Surely He is ever Aware, 
Seer, of His servants. 

Section 4: Moral Precepts 

31 And do not kill your children for fear of poverty — We 
provide for them and for you. Surely the killing of them is a great 
wrong. 32 And do not go near to fornication: surely it is an 



a (27) While enjoining charity, the Quran also draws attention to economy, 
thus indicating the golden mean. Those who waste wealth are called the devil's 
brethren, because they are ungrateful to God for wasting away what He has given 
them out of His grace. 

b (28) Hoping for mercy from the Lord means standing in need of the bounty 
of the Lord, i.e., not having anything to give to the needy. In that case one should 
still speak to the needy gently. A saying of the Holy Prophet declares a gentle word 
spoken to someone to be a deed of charity (Bukhari, 56:72). 

c (29) By the hand being tied to the neck is meant being miserly, and by 
stretching it forth to its fullest extension is meant being wasteful. The verse teaches 
that the middle path should be adopted in one's ordinary expenses. 

rf(31) Infanticide, in the case of daughters, was met with among the Arabs, 
but this was not for fear of poverty. Since the word children (aulad) includes both 
males and females, the killing of children here may mean not giving them proper 
education; ignorance, or intellectual death, being treated as death. (Editor 's Note: 
Abortion without a medical reason may also be included here.)

obscenity. And evil is the way." 33 And do not kill the soul which 
Allah has forbidden except for a just cause. And whoever is killed 
unjustly, We have indeed given to his heir authority — but let him 
not exceed the limit in killing. Surely he will be helped. 

34 And do not draw near to the orphan's property, except in 
the best way, till he attains his maturity. And fulfil the promise; 
surely the promise will be enquired into. 35 And give full measure 
when you measure out, and weigh with a true balance. This is fair 
and better in the end. 36 And do not follow that of which you have 
no knowledge/ Surely the hearing and the sight and the heart, all 
of these will be asked about it. 37 And do not go about in the land 
exultingly, for you cannot split the earth, nor reach the mountains 
in height. 38 A11 this, the evil of it, is hateful in the sight of your 
Lord. 

39 This is from the wisdom which your Lord has revealed to 
you. And do not set up with Allah any other god, or you would be 
thrown into hell, blamed, cast away. 40 Has then your Lord pre- 
ferred to give you sons, and (for Himself) taken daughters from 
among the angels? Surely you utter a terrible saying. 

Section 5: Disbelievers grow Harder 

41 And certainly We have repeated (warnings) in this Quran 
that they may be mindful. And it only adds to their aversion. 



a (32) The Quran not only forbids all out-of-wedlock sex, but enjoins people 
not to go near it, thus avoiding all those opportunities which are likely to tempt 
one to fall into the evil. Hence it is that Islam discourages the too free inter- 
mingling of the sexes. 

b (33) The words he will be helped indicate that as the state is bound to help 
him by bringing the murderer within reach of the law, the heir should not take the 
law into his own hands. This is called exceeding the limits. 

c (36) If this injunction were followed, all society gossip would immediately 
cease, relieving many innocent people of the heart-burning which they suffer on 
account of evil and unfounded reports. The verse also forbids entering into dis- 
cussions without accurate knowledge, or putting forward uncertain opinion. 

rf(41) Allah's purpose in repeating arguments and signs in the Quran is to 
make people mindful, but the more they are reminded, the greater is their aversion 
to it. 



17:42' DISBELIEVERS GROW HARDER 345 

42 Say: If there were with Him gods, as they say, then certainly 
they would have been able to seek a way to the Lord of the Throne." 
43 Glory be to Him, and He is supremely exalted above what they 
say! 44 The seven heavens and the earth and those in them declare 
His glory. And there is not a single thing but glorifies Him with 
His praise, but you do not understand their glorification. Surely He 
is Forbearing, Forgiving. 

45 And when you recite the Quran, We place between you and 
those who do not believe in the Hereafter a hidden barrier; c 46 and 
We put coverings on their hearts and a deafness in their ears that 
they may not understand it; and when you mention your Lord alone 
in the Quran, they turn their backs in aversion. 47 We know best 
what they listen to when they listen to you, and when they take 
counsel secretly, when the wrongdoers say: You follow only a man 
deprived of reason. 48 See, what they liken you to! So they have 
gone astray, and cannot find the way. 

49 And they say: When we are bones and decayed particles, 
shall we then be raised up as a new creation? s0 Say: Be stones or 
iron, 51 or some other creature of those which are too hard (to 



a (42) The idol-worshippers were sunk deep in vices and immorality, while 
access to the Divine Being — a way to the Lord of the Throne — which they 
claimed they got through their idols, should have purified their lives. Or, the 
meaning is that, if they had access to God, Who holds all power in His hands, 
they should have received Divine help and been successful in uprooting Islam. 

b (44) The whole universe is here mentioned as declaring the glory of Allah, 
which means declaring God to be free from every imperfection and impurity, or 
from everything derogatory to His dignity. This declaration need not be with the 
tongue and in words: in fact, the very dependence of the whole creation on the 
Creator and its consequent imperfection is a glorification of the Creator. 

c (45) This hidden barrier is nothing but that erected by their own aversion, as 
plainly indicated in v. 41. 

d (46) The placing of coverings on the hearts and deafness in the ears of the 
disbelievers is no doubt attributed to Allah as the prime cause of all things, but 
this covering and deafness is directly brought about because they do not even listen 
to the mention of Allah, and flee in aversion from His word. Allah brings it about 
on account of the condition of their very hearts and ears. See also 7:179.

us? Say: He Who created you at first. Still they will shake their 
heads at you and say: When will it be? Say: Maybe it has drawn 
near. 52 0n the day when He will call you forth, then will you 
obey Him, giving Him praise, and you will think that you remain- 
ed only a little (while). 

Section 6: Punishment must follow 

53 And say to My servants that they speak what is best. 
Surely the devil sows dissensions among them. The devil is surely 
an open enemy to man. c 54 Your Lord knows you best. He will have 
mercy on you, if He please, or He will punish you, if He please. 
And We have not sent you as being in charge of them. 55 And your 
Lord best knows those who are in the heavens and the earth. And 
certainly We made some of the prophets to excel others, and to 
David We gave the Zabur. e 



a (51-1) They are told that a life after death must follow even if they could 
change themselves into stones. And the spiritual life with which they were quick- 
ened by the Holy Prophet, despite their hard-heartedness — "they were like rocks, 
rather worse in hardness" (2:74) — was a clear proof of this. 

b (51-2) The answer, maybe it has drawn near, refers to the spiritual resusci- 
tation of Arabia, which was now to be accomplished through the Holy Prophet, as 
an indication of the greater Resurrection. The next verse makes it clear: Then will 
you obey Him, giving Him praise. Fifteen years after this the whole of Arabia re- 
sounded with Divine praises. 

c (53) The Muslims — My servants — are here enjoined to be very kind 
when they speak to the disbelievers. It is related that when the Muslims com- 
plained to the Holy Prophet that they were abused by the idolaters, they were told 
to be kind and not to retaliate. It was the devil that was causing these quarrels. 
The words evidently imply that these dissensions were only transient, and that the 
two parties would again become united. 

d (54) In this verse, as elsewhere in the Quran, mercy is mentioned first, thus 
showing that Divine mercy has precedence over Divine retribution. 

e (55) By saying that some of the prophets are made to excel others, the 
excellence of the Holy Prophet over others is implied. David is specially men- 
tioned, because, as stated in the Psalms (called here Zabur), he prayed for the utter 
destruction of his enemies, whereas the two previous verses show that the Holy 
Prophet was enjoined to deal mercifully with his opponents. 



17 : 56 • PUNISHMENT MUST FOLLOW 347 

56 Say: Call on those whom you assert besides Him; they have 
no power to remove distress from you nor to change. 57 Those whom 
they call upon, themselves seek the means of access to their Lord 
— whoever of them is nearest — and they hope for His mercy and 
fear His punishment. Surely the punishment of your Lord is a 
thing to be cautious of." 58 And there is not a town but We will 
destroy it before the day of Resurrection or punish it with a severe 
punishment. That is written in the Book. 59 And nothing hindered 
Us from sending signs, but the ancients rejected them. c And We 
gave to Thamud the she-camel, a manifest sign, but they did her 
wrong, and We send signs only to warn. 

60 And when We said to you: Surely jour Lord encompasses 
people. And We made the vision which We showed you only a 



a (57) These divinities, it is argued, themselves hoped for Divine mercy and 
feared His retribution; the nearer a person to the Divine Being, the greater was his 
hope of mercy and his fear of punishment if he disobeyed. 

b (58) There is a prophetical reference here to great disasters which would 
ruin populous towns. The words "before the day of Resurrection" clearly show that 
the destruction of the towns does not refer to the end of things. Already we have 
seen the fulfilment of this prophecy in the destruction of populous towns in almost 
every country of the world on an unprecedented scale, but it is nothing compared 
with the havoc which the atomic bomb and other inventions of this modern age 
are likely to work, if the mad struggle for power is not ended. It should be noted 
that the prophecy of the ruination of populous towns is here mentioned as a part 
of the Divine scheme in the ultimate triumph of Islam with which this chapter 
deals, and hence the reference to the sending of signs in v. 59. 

c (59) After speaking of a great sign in the latter days, the destruction of 
towns on a large scale, this verse speaks of a general law that God has always been 
sending signs to establish truth, and that nothing ever hindered Him from sending 
signs, though such signs were rejected by the people to whom they were sent. It is 
further made clear that signs are sent to warn people of the evil consequences of 
doing evil. 

rf(60-l) The reference here is to the vision of Ascension or the Mi 'raj 
(Bukhari, 63:42), which was really a prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Islam. In 
a Hadith report the words describing the condition in which the Holy Prophet was 
at the time of this Ascension are: whilst I was in a state between that of one sleep- 
ing and one awake (Bukhari, 59:6). Thus it was not an Ascension of the body. 
Although he was not asleep he was in a vision. He was actually carried to the 
Holy Presence, and he was shown great wonders, but it was in spirit that he was

trial for people, as also the tree cursed in the Quran." And We 
warn them, but it only adds to their great inordinacy. 

Section 7: The Devil's Opposition to the Righteous 

61 And when We said to the angels: Be submissive to Adam, 
they submitted, but not IblTs. He said: Shall I submit to him 
whom You have created of dust? 62 He said: Do You see, this is he 
whom You have honoured above me! If You grant me respite to 
the day of Resurrection, I will certainly cause his progeny to perish 
except a few. 63 He said: Go away! Whoever of them follows you 
surely hell is your recompense, a full recompense. 64 And incite 
whoever of them you can with jour voice, c and collect against them 
your horse(-men) and your foot(-soldiers), and share with them in 
wealth and children, 6 and promise them. And the devil promises 
them only to deceive. 65 My servants — you have surely no authority 



carried, and it was with the spiritual eye that he saw those wonders, not in body 
and with the physical eye, for things spiritual can only be seen with the spiritual 
eye. This vision had an important significance. He saw it at a time when his con- 
dition was one of utmost helplessness, and he was shown that a great future lay 
before him. His opponents, as usual, disbelieved in such visions, and laughed at 
him. 

a (60-2) As the Holy Prophet's vision signified his future triumph and gave 
an indication of the greatness to which Islam would rise, the statement made else- 
where that the tree oizaqqiim was the food of sinners (44:43-44) contained a pro- 
phecy of the discomfiture of the enemies of Islam, telling them that a deadly food 
was in store for them. The reason why the vision and the statement about the cursed 
tree are conjoined is that the triumph of Islam and the discomfiture of the enemy 
went hand in hand. 

b (61) See 2:34 and 7:12. 

c (64-1) The devil is here compared with a coward who comes with great 
show but little real force, and who, if shown the least resistance, retreats at every 
step. Every inviter who invites people to the disobedience of Allah is such a devil. 

d (64-2) The forces of the devil are no other than the evildoers, those going 
quickly into evil being likened to horsemen and those who walk slowly in their 
evil course being likened to infantry. 

e (64-3) The sharing of the devil in wealth signifies everything spent or 
acquired unlawfully and sharing in children is in reference to committing forni- 
cation. 



17:66' OPPOSITION TO THE PROPHET 349 

over them." And your Lord is sufficient as having charge of 
affairs. 

66 Your Lord is He Who speeds the ships for you in the sea 
that you may seek of His grace. Surely He is ever Merciful to you. 
67 And when distress afflicts you in the sea, away go those whom 
you call on except He; but when He brings you safe to the land, 
you turn away. And man is ever ungrateful.* 68 Do you then feel 
secure that He will not bring you low on a tract of land, or send on 
you a violent wind? c Then you will not find a protector for your- 
selves; 69 or, do you feel secure that He will not take you back into 
it another time, then send on you a fierce gale and thus overwhelm 
you for your ungratefulness? Then you will not find any aider 
against Us in the matter. 70 And surely We have honoured the 
children of Adam, and We carry them in the land and the sea, and 
We provide them with good things, and We have made them to 
excel highly most of those whom We have created. 

Section 8: Opposition to the Prophet 

71 On the day when We shall call every people with their 
leader: then whoever is given his book in his right hand, these 
will read their book; and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the 
least. 6 72 And whoever is blind in this (world) he will be blind 



a (65) My servants may include all human beings. The devil will say to the 
sinners: I had no authority over you (14:22). 

b (67) A true picture is drawn here of human nature, which turns to Allah in 
affliction but forgets Him in ease. 

c (68) It was by a violent wind that the combined forces of all the enemies of 
Islam were brought low in the battle of the Allies, when, besieging Madinah in the 
year 5 A.H., they had to flee in disorder. 

d (71-1) The meaning is that the righteous will follow the righteous leaders 
and the wicked will follow their wicked leaders. The word imam, or leader, here is 
interpreted in several other ways, meaning scripture, prophet, law, book of deeds. 
The last of these significances also suits the context, as the books of deeds are 
spoken of in the words that follow. 

e (71-2) This book is the one mentioned in v. 14, i.e., the effect of one's 
deeds, which will be brought before everyone in a palpable form on the day 



350 17. THE ISRAELITES • 17 : 73 



in the Hereafter, and further away from the path." 

73 And surely they had purposed to turn you away from what 
We have revealed to you, that you should forge against Us (some 
revelation) other than that, and then they would have taken you for 
a friend. 74 And if We had not made you firm, you might have 
indeed inclined to them a little; 75 then We would have made you 
taste a double (punishment) in life and a double (punishment) after 
death, and then you would not have found any helper against Us. 
76 And surely they purposed to unsettle you from the land that they 
might expel you from it, and then they will not remain after you 
but a little while. c 77 (This is Our) way with Our messengers 
whom We sent before you, and you will not find a change in Our 
course. 



Section 9: Truth will prevail 

78 Keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the 
darkness of the night, and the recital of the Quran at dawn. Surely 



of Resurrection. The book of deeds is given in the right hand to those who hold 
the Book of God in their right hands here, i.e., act upon it. As against them are 
those spoken of in the next verse; they remain blind to the Book of God, so they 
will be blind in the Hereafter. 

a (72) Those who remain blind to truth in this life remain blind in the life 
after death, which shows that it is here that a hellish life begins with spiritual 
blindness, and that the hell of the next life is also a blindness. This is corroborated 
by what is said in 57:12, that the faithful will have a light on that day. 

b (73) This refers to an incident at Makkah when the chief men of the 
Quraish offered to give the Prophet wealth or to make him their king, if he gave 
up speaking against their idols and their evil ways. The Prophet's reply was that 
he wanted neither of these things, but that it was for their welfare that he asked 
them to give up evil ways. 

c (76) When the opponents failed to make the Prophet swerve from the path 
of Truth, they planned to expel him from the land, though they were told before- 
hand that in that case they themselves would not retain power but for a short time. 
It was only eight years after the Hijrah that the Prophet entered Makkah as a 
conqueror. 

rf(77) This law is also stated in 14:13-14. 



1 7 : 79 • TRUTH WILL PREVAIL 351 

the recital of the Quran at dawn is witnessed." 79 And during a part 
of the night, keep awake by it, beyond what is incumbent on you; 
maybe jour Lord will raise you to a position of great glory. e 
80 And say: My Lord, make me enter a truthful entering, and make 
me go forth a truthful exit, and grant me from Your presence an 
authority to help (me). 81 And say: The Truth has come and false- 
hood vanished. Surely falsehood is ever bound to vanish. 2 



a (78) After describing how the opponents wanted to bring the Prophet's 
mission to failure by various means, the Prophet is told to resort to prayer as a 
solution of the great difficulties he faced. From the declining of the sun to sunset 
are zuhr and 'asr, or the early and late afternoon prayers, while from sunset till 
darkness are maghrib and 'isha ', or the sunset prayer and the prayer at nightfall. 
The fifth is the morning prayer, which is called here Qur 'an al-fajr, or the recital 
of the Quran at dawn. Thus this verse, which is one of the very early revelations, 
mentions all the five prayers. 

b (79-1) This refers to the tahajjud prayer, whose name is derived from the 
words "keep awake" (fa-tahajjad). The time for this prayer is the latter portion of 
the night in the early hours. It is not an obligatory prayer but, as stated here, it is 
the means of raising a man to a position of great glory. The time at which it is said 
is most suited for the concentration of mind and for communion with God. 

c (79-2) The man whom the opponents had planned to expel from their city 
as a helpless man was to be raised to a position of eminent dignity through prayer 
to God, the tahajjud prayer in the night in particular. As time passes on, the 
Prophet is ever rising to positions of greater and greater glory. But while the verse 
speaks in particular of the Prophet and of the great glory to which he was destined 
to rise, it gives a promise in general as well that whoever is sincere in calling upon 
God, especially at night, is raised to a position of glory. 

rf(80) The reference here is a prophecy of the Prophet's Flight, entering 
Madinah and going forth from Makkah. But the words are also general, man 
being taught here to pray that his entering into any affair and his exit may be 
marked by truthfulness, and that he may be granted Divine help in all his under- 
takings. 

e (81) The advent of the Prophet is here spoken of as the advent of the Truth, 
in reference to the prophecy in John 16:13: "However, when he, the Spirit of 
truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own 
authority, but whatever he hears he will speak; and he will tell you things to 
come." The vanishing of falsehood is here spoken of in the past tense to indicate 
the certainty of its occurrence. Falsehood finally disappeared from Makkah when 
the Prophet entered it as a conqueror, and as the House of the Holy One was 
cleared of the idols, the Prophet recited this verse, The Truth has come and false- 
hood vanished (Bukhari, 46:32), thus showing that he understood it to contain the 



352 17. THE ISRAELITES • 17 : 82 

82 And the Quran that We reveal is a healing and a mercy to 
the believers, and it only increases the wrongdoers in loss. a 83 And 
when We bestow favours on man, he turns away and behaves 
proudly; and when evil afflicts him, he is in despair. 84 Say: Every- 
one acts according to his manner. But your Lord best knows who 
is best guided on the path. 

Section 10: The Quran — a Unique Guidance 

85 And they ask you about the revelation/ Say: The reve- 
lation is by the commandment of my Lord, and you are not given 
knowledge but a little. 86 And if We please, We could certainly take 
away what We have revealed to you, then you would find none to 
plead (your cause) against Us — 87 But it is a mercy from your Lord. 
Surely His bounty to you is abundant. 

88 Say: If people and jinn should combine together to bring 
the like of this Quran, they could not bring the like of it, though 
they helped one another. 89 And certainly We have made clear for 

prophecy of the conquest of Makkah. The statement made here, however, is 
general and it means that falsehood cannot stand before Truth and that Truth must 
finally prevail in the whole world. 

a (82) The Quran is here called a healing and a mercy for spiritual diseases, 
and history bears testimony that spiritual diseases were all swept away by the 
Quran. But, it is added, it is a healing for the believers who follow it, and not for 
those who reject it, and its rejection brings only greater loss. 

b (84) Both the believer and the disbeliever act according to the rules of con- 
duct which they have set before themselves. Who is on the right path is made 
clear by the consequences which appear later but which are always known to God. 

c (85) The word ruh means inspiration or revelation as well as spirit. Here, 
before this verse as well as after it, the Quran is the only topic of discussion, and 
therefore the context shows clearly that the question of the disbelievers is not about 
the soul of man, but about the Quran itself. 

rf(88) See 2:23 and 11:13 footnote. Out of the four places in which the 
disbelievers are challenged to produce the like of the Quran, this is the only one 
where the jinn and the people are spoken of together; in all the other places the 
shuhada ', meaning helpers, leaders or their great men, take the place of the jinn. 
This shows that the word jinn is used in the Quran for the leaders of evil. 



17 : 90 • JUSTICE OF RETRIBUTION 353 

people in this Quran every kind of description, but most people 
consent only to denying. 90 And they say: We will by no means 
believe in you, till you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth 
for us, 91 or&gt;&gt;ou have a garden of palms and grapes in the midst of 
which you cause rivers to flow forth abundantly, 92 or you cause 
the heaven to come down upon us in pieces, as you think, or bring 
Allah and the angels face to face (with us), 93 or you have a house 
of gold, or you ascend into heaven. And we will not believe in 
your ascending till you bring down to us a book we can read. Say: 
Glory be to my Lord! Am I anything but a mortal messenger? c 

Section 1 1 : Justice of Retribution 

94 And nothing prevents people from believing, when the 
guidance comes to them, except that they say: Has Allah raised up 
a mortal to be a messenger? 95 Say: If there had been in the earth 
angels walking about secure, We would have sent down to them 
from the heaven an angel as messenger. 96 Say: Allah is sufficient 
for a witness between me and you. Surely He is ever Aware of His 
servants, Seer (of them). 

97 And he whom Allah guides, he is on the right way; and he 
whom He leaves in error, for them you will find no guardians 
besides Him. And We shall gather them together on the day of 
Resurrection on their faces, blind and dumb and deaf. Their abode 
is hell. Whenever it abates, We make them burn the more. 



a (89) It is here affirmed that all that contributes to the moral and spiritual 
welfare of man is made distinct in the Quran. 

b (90) The signs demanded in this and the following three verses relate to the 
promises made for the righteous and the threats of punishment for the wicked, and 
they were no doubt fulfilled in due time. But the disbelievers wanted to see the 
spiritual blessings of communion with God in a physical shape. The believers were 
granted gardens with rivers running in them even in this life, and punishment 
from heaven overtook the opponents, but this was to come about gradually. 

c (93) The answer to all the demands of the disbelievers is that the Prophet 
was only a mortal messenger, and the prophecies regarding his own great future 
or the discomfiture of his enemies would be brought to fulfilment gradually, as in 
the case of messengers before him. 



354 17. THE ISRAELITES • 17 : 98 

98 This is their retribution because they disbelieve in Our messages 
and say: When we are bones and decayed particles, shall we then 
be raised up into a new creation? "Do they not see that Allah, 
Who created the heavens and the earth, is Able to create the like 
of them? And He has appointed for them a term, of which there is 
no doubt. But the wrongdoers consent only to denying. 100 Say: If 
you control the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, then you would 
withhold (them) for fear of spending. And man is ever miserly. 

Section 12: Comparison with Moses 

101 And certainly We gave Moses nine clear signs; so ask the 
Children of Israel. When he came to them, Pharaoh said to him: 
Surely I think you, Moses, to be one bewitched. 102 He said: Truly 
you know that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has 
sent these as clear proofs; and surely I believe you, Pharaoh, to be 
lost. 103 So he desired to scare them from the land, but We drowned 
him and those with him, all together; 104 and We said to the 
Children of Israel after him: Abide in the land. But when the latter 
promise came, We brought you all rolled up." 

105 And with truth have We revealed it, and with truth did it 
come. And We have not sent you but as a giver of good news and 
as a warner. 106 And it is a Quran We have made distinct, so that 
you may read it to the people by slow degrees, and We have 
revealed it in portions. 

107 Say: Believe in it or do not believe. Surely those who are 
given the knowledge before it, fall down prostrate on their faces, 
when it is recited to them, 108 and they say: Glory be to our Lord! 
Surely the promise of our Lord was to be fulfilled.* 109 And they fall 



a (104) The latter promise here relates to the promise given to Moses for the 
raising up of another prophet like him. This is corroborated by what is said in the 
next verse about the revelation of the Quran, which came with truth, i.e., in fulfil- 
ment of a true promise. By the rolling up of the Israelites is meant that they would 
make way for another people, who would inherit the kingdom of God. 

b (108) The promise spoken of here is no doubt the promise given to the 
former prophets regarding the advent of the Holy Prophet; and by knowledge in 
the previous verse is also meant knowledge of the prophecies .

down on their faces, weeping, and it adds to their humility. 
no Say: Call on Allah or call on the Beneficent. a By whatever 
(name) you call on Him, He has the best names. And do not be 
loud in your prayer nor be silent in it, and seek a way between 
these. m And say: Praise be to Allah! Who has not taken to Him- 
self a son, and Who does not have a partner in the kingdom, and 
Who does not have a helper because of weakness; and proclaim 
His greatness, magnifying (Him). 



a (110-1) The name Rahman (Beneficent) seems to have been particularly 
objectionable to the Arabs, who objected to its use even so late as the truce at 
Hudaibiyah. The Christians also do not recognize Allah to be Rahman, because it 
means that Allah shows mercy to His creatures without their having done any- 
thing to deserve it, while the Christian doctrine of atonement is based on the belief 
that Allah cannot show mercy to His creatures without receiving some satisfac- 
tion. 

b (110-2) The two extremes with regard to prayer are its utterance in a very 
loud voice or not uttering any word at all with the tongue, thinking that God 
knows what is in the hearts. Muslims are told to take the middle course between 
the two extremes. Utterance of words makes the prayer go deeper down into the 
heart of man, and thus makes it more effective. 



Chapter 18 
Ai-Kahf The Cave 

This chapter deals with both the early state of Christianity, when it was under 
persecution and practised renunciation of the world, and prophetically with 
its latter-day condition when Christian nations have acquired unsurpassed 
material dominance in the world. It is called The Cave because early Chris- 
tians sought refuge in such places from persecution and practised monkery in 
solitude. In the first as well as the last section the doctrine of the Divine 
sonship of Jesus is denounced (v. 4, v. 102) and the purely material engross- 
ment of these nations is prophesied to lead to material and spiritual failure (v. 
7-8, v. 103-104). In between, the chapter treats the following subjects: a 
story from early Christianity of the dwellers of the cave, containing propheti- 
cal allusions to its later history, rejection of the truth by those who possess 
wealth and power, the guilty being brought to judgment, a story of Moses' 
search for knowledge and finding a man of God superior to him in know- 
ledge, indicating the coming of Islam, and a story of King Darius I and his 
efforts to repel the two tribes of Gog and Magog, which again contains a pro- 
phetical allusion to the rise and dominance of modern Western nations. This 
chapter was revealed in the early period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : A Warning to the Christians 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Praise be to Allah! Who revealed the Book to His servant, 
and did not allow in it any crookedness, 2 rightly directing," to give 
warning of severe punishment from Him and to give good news to 
the believers who do good that theirs is a goodly reward, 3 staying 
in it forever; 4 and to warn those who say: Allah has taken to Him- 
self a son. 5 They have no knowledge of it, nor had their fathers. 
Grievous is the word that comes out of their mouths. They speak 



a (2) The Quran is here described as possessing two qualifications. The first 
refers to its own perfection, there is no crookedness in it; and the second speaks 
of it as a book suited to make others perfect, for it is called qayyim, as meaning 
one that rightly directs others.

18:6« A WARNING TO THE CHRISTIANS 357 

nothing but a lie. " 6 Then perhaps you will kill yourself with grief, 
sorrowing after them, if they do not believe in this announce- 
ment. 

7 Surely We have made whatever is on the earth an embellish- 
ment for it, so that We may try which of them is best in works. 
8 And We shall surely make what is on it dust, without vegetation/ 



a (5) The Holy Prophet is reported to have said: He who remembers the first 
ten verses of the chapter entitled The Cave is protected from the tribulation of 
Dajjal (the Antichrist) (Sahih Muslim, 6:42). In another report the last ten verses 
of The Cave instead of the first ten are mentioned (Abu Dawud, 36:12). Now in 
the first and the last sections of this chapter the Christian doctrine of the divinity 
of Jesus is condemned. In the first section a warning is given to those who say 
Allah has taken to Himself a son (v. 4), in the last two to those who take My ser- 
vants to befriends besides Me (v. 102), and this doctrine, the doctrine of sonship 
and of the divinity of a servant of God, is the basic doctrine of the Christian reli- 
gion. Moreover, in the concluding ten verses, a true description of the occupation 
of Christian nations is given in the words whose effort goes astray in this world's 
life (v. 104). The Holy Prophet's saying quoted above plainly shows that the 
Dajjal of the Hadith is the same as the upholders of the erroneous Christian doc- 
trine of the sonship and divinity of Jesus Christ. Christianity, in its present form, 
being opposed to the true teachings of Christ, is thus the only Antichrist known to 
the Quran. 

b (6) The anxiety which the Holy Prophet felt on account of a fallen huma- 
nity was so great that he is spoken of here as almost killing himself with grief. His 
was a life of absolute devotion to the cause of humanity, his only concern being 
that man should rise to the true dignity for which God had made him. This anxiety 
was not only for those who were directly addressed by him, but, as the context 
shows, it was as deep for another people, who attributed a son to the Divine Being, 
and whom outward finery was to mislead to such an extent as to make them 
strangers to spiritual truth. Reading the next verse leaves no doubt that the 
Prophet was shown the earthly embellishments which are so great a trial for 
Christendom today. The word announcement here refers to the Quran. 

c (8) The picture drawn here is of the beautiful cities of the modern age, with 
all their attractions and luxuries, which so engross people that they neither pay 
attention to the preaching of truth nor to the pursuit of righteousness. The earth 
will be first beautified to its utmost, we are told here, and then laid waste, by man's 
own hands, lofty buildings being reduced to dust and beautiful gardens being 
turned into bare earth without any vegetation on it. All prophecies made known 
through the righteous servants of God, the prophets of the Old Testament and 
Jesus Christ, and then through the Quran and the Hadith, point to world-wide 
conflicts in the latter days, of nation rising against nation, and of destruction of 



358 18. THE CAVE -18:9 

9 0r, do you think that the companions of the Cave and the Inscrip- 
tion were from among Our wonderful signs?" 10 When the youths 
sought refuge in the Cave, they said: Our Lord, grant us mercy 
from Yourself, and provide for us a right course in our affair. n So 
We prevented them from hearing in the Cave for a number of 
years, 4 12 then We raised them up that We might know which 

cities on a vast scale. Science first embellished the earth and science is now turn- 
ing it into a waste, by its atom bombs and other diabolic inventions. 

a (9) The Cave stands for the Christian institution of monkery, this being the 
distinctive characteristic which it assumed soon after its birth. Raqim means an 
inscription or a tablet with a writing upon it. The Inscription contains a propheti- 
cal reference to an aspect of the Christian religion quite opposed to its first aspect 
of growth in the Cave. Inscription (or Advertisement) is, in fact, as prominent a 
feature of the business activities of the Christian nations of today as the Cave was 
a feature of their religious activities in the early days. The Quran seems to have 
chosen the epithets to designate the Christian nations by indicating their most pro- 
minent characteristics in their early and their latter days. 

The account from here to v. 22 is generally identified with the memorable 
story of the "seven sleepers", Christian youths who took refuge in a cave to escape 
the persecution of the Roman Emperor Decius around the year 250 C.E. Accord- 
ing to the story, the Emperor ordered the entrance to the cave to be blocked with 
stones. It is stated that the youths fell asleep as soon as they were shut up in the 
cave, and awoke 187 years after this in the reign of Theodosius (some state 375 
years), when the stones were removed to supply building material for some edifice. 
They then sent one of their number to bring food for them from the city, but he 
was taken to the judge on presenting a coin of the reign of Decius, and thus the 
youths were discovered. The story as narrated in the Quran does not credit the 
unnatural incidents of the above account. It only speaks of some men having 
taken refuge in a dark cave on account of a religious persecution; where and when 
it does not state. After they had rested for a part of a day, they made arrangements 
to get their food from outside (v. 19), and remained in this condition for "a 
number of years" (v. 11), but were subsequently discovered, and an edifice being 
built at the mouth of the cave caused their death (v. 21). It mentions conjectures 
as to their number and the number of years they remained in the cave (v. 22), but 
does not go beyond saying that there were some men who remained in the cave 
for some years. 

However, the story itself is not without a deeper meaning, and more state- 
ments than one show that there is a reference to the history of Christianity itself in 
the story. 

b (11) The meaning is that these people remained cut off from the rest of the 
world for a number of years. The Quran does not support the story that they 
remained in the cave for hundreds of years or that they were asleep all this time.

of the two parties was best able to calculate the time for which 
they remained." 

Section 2: The Dwellers in the Cave 

13 We relate to you their story with truth. Surely they were 
youths who believed in their Lord and We increased them in 
guidance. 14 And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up 
and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; we 
call upon no god beside Him, for then indeed we should utter an 
enormity. 

15 These our people have taken gods beside Him. Why do 
they not bring clear authority for them? Who is then more unjust 
than he who forges a lie against Allah? 16 And when you withdraw 
from them and what they worship except Allah, take refuge in the 
Cave; your Lord will spread forth for you some of His mercy, and 
provide for you a profitable course in your affair. 

17 And you might see the sun, when it rose, decline from their 
Cave to the right, and when it set leave them behind on the left, 
while they were in a wide space of it. c This is from among the 
signs of Allah. He whom Allah guides, he is on the right way; and 
whom He leaves in error, you will not find for him a friend to 
guide aright. 

Section 3: The Dwellers in the Cave 

18 And you might think them awake while they were asleep, 
and We turned them about to the right and to the left, with their 



a (12) The raising them up might signify raising them up from sleep, as also 
raising them up into a condition of activity, after their remaining cut off from the 
world, as stated in the previous verse. 

b (14) This is to show that the early followers of Christianity were Unitarians 
— believers in one God only. 

c (17) This describes the position of the cave, which was so situated that it 
did not admit sunshine. This could easily happen in a cave with its mouth to the 
north, situated in the northern hemisphere and above the tropic of cancer. With 
reference to the history of Christianity it may indicate its coming to Europe. 



360 18. THE CAVE -18:19 

dog outstretching its paws at the entrance. If you looked at them, 
you would turn back from them in flight, and you would be filled 
with awe because of them." 

19 And thus did We rouse them that they might question each 
other. A speaker from among them said: How long have you 
stayed? They said: We have stayed for a day or a part of a day. 
(Others) said: Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed. 
Now send one of you with this silver (coin) of yours to the city, 
then let him see what food is purest, and bring you provision from 
it, and let him behave with gentleness, and not make your case 
known to anyone. c 20 For if they prevail against you, they would 
stone you to death or force you back to their religion, and then you 
would never succeed. 



a (18) What is related in this section is clearly applicable to the story of the 
seven sleepers, as also to the later history of Christianity. In the first case, the 
meaning is that the youths, who fled for fear of persecution and betook them- 
selves to a cave, slept for some time with a dog at the door of the cave. The whole 
scene was rather awe-inspiring: a dark cave, in some distant and uninhabited part 
of the country, with some men sleeping in it and a dog at the door. Applied to the 
history of Christianity the statement is equally true. In this case it should be borne 
in mind that ruqud ("asleep") also means inactive or stagnant. Similarly aiqaz 
("awake") means vigilant or wary. The turning about to the right and to the left, 
which signifies an uneasy condition while sleeping, may be used as expressing the 
activities of a man or a nation. Thus there may be a reference here to the lethargy 
in which the Christian nations remained for a long time, and to their subsequent 
going about in the world in all directions. It may also be noted that Europeans are 
generally fond of dogs. 

b (19-1) This may refer either to the time for which the youths slept or to the 
centuries of inactivity of the Christian nations. A day of a thousand years is 
spoken of in the Quran (see 22:47, etc.), and therefore the word day, applied to 
the history of a nation, may signify a thousand years. 

c (19-2) After having been refreshed with sleep, which might have been 
brought on by the fatigue of the journey, they thought of procuring food for them- 
selves in that solitary cave and sent one of them to the city, and impressed on him 
that he should be gentle and should not give an inkling of their whereabouts to 
anyone. In reference to the history of Christianity, this speaks of the commercial 
activities of the Christian nations (i.e. in Asia and Africa, by means of which their 
rule was established. The words "and not make your case known to anyone" apply 
to their hidden intentions of gaining rule under the pretext of trade. — Editor) 



18:21' THE DWELLERS IN THE CAVE 361 

21 And thus did We make (people) to get knowledge of 
them," that they might know that Allah's promise is true and that 
the Hour — there is no doubt about it.* When they disputed 
among themselves about their affair and said: Erect an edifice 
over them. c Their Lord knows best about them. Those who 
prevailed in their affair said: We shall certainly build a place of 
worship over them. 22 (Some) say: (They were) three, the fourth 
of them their dog; and (others) say: Five, the sixth of them their 
dog, making conjectures about the unseen. And (others) say: 
Seven, and the eighth of them their dog. Say: My Lord best knows 
their number — none knows them but a few. So do not contend in 
their matter but with a clear argument, and do not question any of 
them concerning them. 6 



a (21-1) It was their going out to purchase food that brought them to the 
knowledge of the outside world. It is not stated how long they continued in this 
state. Comparing this with v. 11, however, we may say that they passed several 
years in this condition. 

b (21-2) The result of their becoming known is described in words which 
show that they were put to death, because the promise of Allah as to a future state 
of life is fully realized only after death. 

c (21-3) These words show that their death was brought about by closing the 
mouth of the cave. This is what is meant by the erection of an edifice over them. 
The words may also signify the erection of a monument. 

d (21-4) The people spoken of here are those who prevailed in their affair. 
This is a later incident, when Christianity became the dominant religion of the 
Roman Empire, and the reference here seems to be to the saint-worship which 
was prevalent in Christianity. 

e (22) This verse and v. 25 show that these are only conjectures of the people 
with regard to them. Their number and the number of years during which they 
remained in the cave are both matters which are said to be only known to Allah. 
Ibn Abbas is, however, of the opinion that the words condemning the first two as 
conjectures show that the last-mentioned number, i.e., seven, is correct. {Editor's 
Note: In his Urdu commentary, Maulana Muhammad Ali has applied this number 
to the number of Western powers, whose number varies depending on whether 
they are counted individually or in groups according to their treaty alliances.) 

According to Ibn Jarir's commentary the people referred to in the concluding 
words, any of them, are the people of the Book, or the Christians. It is clear from 
this that it is really the history of Christianity that is dealt with in the story of the 
Companions of the Cave. V. 25, which again speaks of the same people who are 



362 18. THE CAVE -18:23 



Section 4: The Quran as a Guidance 

23 And do not say of anything: I will do that tomorrow, 
24 unless Allah please." And remember jour Lord when you forget 
and say: Maybe my Lord will guide me to a nearer course to the 
right than this. 

25 And they remained in their cave three hundred years, and 
they add nine. e 26 Say: Allah knows best how long they remained. 
His is the unseen of the heavens and the earth. How clear His sight 
and His hearing! There is no guardian for them beside Him, and 
He takes none as partner in His judgment. 

27 And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of 



spoken of here, makes it clear that it is the history of Christianity that is really 
aimed at. 

a (24-1) Though the words are general, there seems to be a special prophetic 
reference to the Prophet's Flight and his taking refuge in a cave. He had entirely 
to trust in Allah, Who was to bring it about as He thought best for him. 

b (24-2) The meaning is that the difficulties which had to be experienced by 
the dwellers in the cave would be removed from the Prophet's way. He had to 
pass only three days in the cave, and though a powerful enemy exerted itself to its 
utmost, his hiding-place at only a distance of three miles from the city, whither 
food was conveyed to him, could not be discovered. Or, in the nearer course there 
is a reference to the unprecedented triumph of Islam, which spread over the whole 
of Arabia within twenty-three years, and spread from Spain in the west to China 
in the east within a century, whereas Christianity remained in a state of subjection 
in its birth-place for three hundred years, as stated in the verse that follows. 

c (25) The history of Christianity, which runs like an undercurrent in the 
story of the Companions of the Cave, finds a clear expression now. There is no 
tradition that the Companions of the Cave remained in the Cave for three hundred 
years, but Christianity itself remained in a Cave for full three hundred years. It is 
a fact that Christianity rose to power with the conversion of Constantine, and at 
the same time it lost its purity with the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity, 
which was promulgated in 325 C.E. It is, moreover, now almost agreed that Jesus 
Christ was born in 6-5 B.C. So if he began his ministry at the age of thirty, the 
Christian religion may be said to have been born at about 25 C.E., and thus exactly 
after three hundred years it lost its purity by the promulgation of the Trinitarian 
doctrine, emerging at the same time as a State religion. Thus it remained in the 
Cave for three hundred years. As to adding nine years, to convert solar years to 
lunar years three years have to be added to every hundred years, and to the three 
centuries another nine years are thus added. 



18:28' A PARABLE 363 

jour Lord. There is none who can alter His words. a And you will 
find no refuge beside Him. 28 And keep yourself with those who 
call on their Lord morning and evening desiring His goodwill, and 
let not your eyes pass from them, desiring the beauties of this 
world's life. And do not follow him whose heart We have made 
unmindful of Our remembrance, and he follows his low desires 
and his case exceeds due bounds. 29 And say: The Truth is from 
your Lord; so whoever wishes, let him believe, and whoever wishes, 
let him disbelieve. Surely We have prepared for the wrongdoers a 
Fire, an enclosure of which will encompass them. And if they cry 
for water, they are given water like molten brass, scalding their 
faces. Evil the drink! And ill the resting-place! 30 As for those 
who believe and do good, We do not waste the reward of him who 
does a good work. 31 These it is for whom are Gardens of 
perpetuity in which rivers flow; they are adorned therein with 
bracelets of gold, and they wear green robes of fine silk and thick 
brocade, reclining therein on raised couches. c Excellent the recom- 
pense! And goodly the resting-place! 

Section 5: A Parable 

32 And set forth to them the parable of two men — for one of 
them We made two gardens of grape-vines, and We surrounded 



a (27) By "words" are meant here prophecies, because it is the prophecy of 
the Prophet's Flight and his final triumph over his enemies that is referred to here. 
These prophecies, it is claimed, cannot be altered by people, and they must come 
to pass, however great the opposing forces. 

b (29) They refused the water of spiritual life in this life, and so they will 
have no water to quench their thirst in the life after death. 

c (31) It is after these things that people hanker in this life, but the ornaments 
and robes of this life are transitory. The righteous, who in this life desire and 
struggle for only spiritual ornaments and moral beauty, find these visible in the 
after-life. However, these prophecies were in one sense brought to fulfilment in 
this very life also. The Arabs, whose only wealth consisted of their camels and 
horses, and whose clothes were made of skins or cloth of rough textures, found 
the treasures of Rome and Persia laid at their feet, and the bracelets of gold and 
the silk brocade interwoven with gold, which they had never seen before, were now 
brought to them in abundance, while the gardens of Mesopotamia and Persia were 
given to them for a permanent heritage. 



364 18. THE CAVE -18:33 

them with date-palms, and between them We made corn-fields. " 
33 Both these gardens yielded their fruits, and did not fail in this at 
all, and We caused a river to gush forth in their midst, 34 and he 
had fruit. So he said to his companion, while arguing with him: 
I have more wealth than you, and am greater in followers. 35 And 
he went into his garden, while he was unjust to himself. He said: I 
do not think that this will ever perish, 36 and I do not think the Hour 
will come; and even if I am returned to my Lord, I will certainly 
find a better place of return than this. 

37 His companion said to him, while arguing with him: Do 
you disbelieve in Him Who created you of dust, then of a small 
life -germ, then He made you a perfect man? 38 But as for me, He, 
Allah, is my Lord, and I set up none as partner with my Lord. 
39 And why did you not say, when you entered your garden: It is as 
Allah has pleased — there is no power except in Allah? If you 
consider me as less than you in wealth and children — 40 then 
maybe my Lord will give me better than your garden, and will send 
on (yours) a reckoning from heaven so that it is dust without plant, 
41 or its water will sink down into the ground, so that you are unable 
to find it. 42 And his fruit was destroyed; so he began to wring his 
hands for what he had spent on it, as it lay waste, its roofs fallen 
down, c and he said: Ah me! I wish I had not set up any partner 
with my Lord! 43 And he had no forces to help him against Allah, 
nor could he defend himself. 44 Thus protection is only Allah's, the 
True One. He is best to (give) reward and best for (determining) 
the final end. 



a (32) The parable set forth here is undoubtedly to illustrate the condition of 
the Christian and the Muslim nations. The former received an abundance of the 
wealth of this life, as is indicated by the gardens of the parable, while the latter, 
though poorer in worldly possessions, were richer in the heavenly blessings of 
Allah. The former reject the message of Truth, of which the latter are the bearers, 
and their vaunt is the same as that of the wealthy man in the parable: / have more 
wealth than you, and am greater in followers (v. 34). 

b (36) By the "Hour" is meant the hour of doom which must overtake every 
people who reject the Truth. 

c (42) Here we have an exact description of the havoc that is being wrought 
in the world before our eyes by modern wars. 



1 8 : 45 • THE GUILTY ARE BROUGHT TO JUDGMENT 365 

Section 6: The Guilty are brought to Judgment 

45 And set forth to them the likeness of the life of this world 
as water which We send down from the cloud, so the vegetation of 
the earth becomes luxuriant by it, then it becomes dry, broken into 
pieces which the winds scatter. And Allah is the Holder of power 
over all things. 46 Wealth and children are an adornment of the life 
of this world; but the ever-abiding, the good works, are better with 
jour Lord in reward and better in hope. 47 And the day when We 
cause the mountains to pass away, and you see the earth a levelled 
plain and We gather them together and leave none of them 
behind." 48 And they are brought before your Lord in ranks. Now 
certainly you have come to Us as We created you at first. But you 
thought that We had not made an appointment for you. 49 And the 
book is placed, and you see the guilty fearing for what is in it, and 
they say: O woe to us! What a book is this! It leaves out neither a 
small thing nor a great one, but numbers them (all), and they find 
what they did confronting them. And your Lord does not wrong 
anyone. 

Section 7: Their Helplessness 

50 And when We said to the angels: Be submissive to Adam, 
they submitted, but not Iblls. He was from among the jinn, so he 
transgressed the commandment of his Lord. c Will you then take 
him and his offspring for friends rather than Me, and they are your 
enemies? Evil is the exchange for the unjust. 51 I did not make 
them witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their 
own creation. Nor could I take those who mislead for aiders. 



a (47) Making the earth a levelled plain indicates the removal of all those 
mighty obstacles which stood in the way of the advancement of Truth, and 
these are the mountains which are made to pass away; see 20:105-107. 

b (49) This comprehensive book is the same as is spoken of in 17:13-14. 
There is not the slightest action, good or bad, which does not leave its effect 
behind. 

c (50) Iblls is one of the jinn or the evil spirits, so it is an error to take him 
for an angel or a good spirit. The spirit of evil is always rebellious, and it is 
against this that man is warned, so that he should resist every evil tendency. 



366 18. THE CAVE -18:52 

52 And one day He will say: Call on those whom you considered to 
be My partners. So they will call on them, but they will not 
answer them, and We shall cause a separation between them. 
53 And the guilty will see the Fire, and know that they are about to 
fall into it, and they will find no escape from it. 

Section 8: Warning is disregarded 

54 And certainly We have made distinct in this Quran for 
mankind every kind of description; and man is in most things con- 
tentious. 55 And nothing prevents people from believing when the 
guidance comes to them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord, 
but that (they wait) for the way of the ancients to catch up with 
them, or that the punishment should confront them. 56 And We do 
not send messengers but as givers of good news and warning, and 
those who disbelieve contend by means of falsehood to weaken 
thereby the Truth, and they take My messages and the warning for 
a mockery. 57 And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of 
the messages of his Lord, then he turns away from them and forgets 
what his hands have already done? Surely We have placed veils 
over their hearts, so they do not understand it, and a deafness in 
their ears. a And if you call them to the guidance, they will even 
then never follow the right course. 

58 And jour Lord is Forgiving, full of mercy. If He were to 
punish them for what they earn, He would certainly hasten the 
punishment for them. But for them there is an appointed time from 
which they will find no refuge. 59 And these towns — We destroyed 
them when they did wrong. And We have appointed a time for 
their destruction. 



a (57) It is when man becomes so iniquitous as to turn away from the truth 
and so callous as not to care for the evil that he does that a veil is placed over his 
heart. 

b (59) The personal pronoun their refers to the opponents of Truth, earlier as 
well as later. 



18 : 60 'MOSES TRAVELS IN SEARCH OF KNOWLEDGE 367 

Section 9: Moses travels in Search of Knowledge 

60 And when Moses said to his servant: " I will not cease until 
I reach the junction of the two rivers, or I will go on for years. 
61 So when they reached the junction of the two (rivers), they forgot 
their fish, and it took its way into the river, being free. 62 But when 
they had gone further, he said to his servant: Bring us our morning 
meal, we have certainly found this journey of ours tiring. 63 He (the 
servant) said: Did you see when we took refuge on the rock, I 
forgot the fish, and none but the devil made me forget to speak of 
it, and it took its way into the river; what a wonder! c 64 He said: 
This is what we sought for. So they returned retracing their foot- 
steps. 



a (60-1) Some reports give his name as Joshua, the son of Nun, the man who 
afterwards appears so prominently in the history of Israel. 

The incidents narrated in verses 60-82 may be the actual experience of 
Moses or this journey may simply be an Ascension of Moses, like the Ascension 
(Mi 'raj) of the Holy Prophet, referred to in the last chapter. What is stated in the 
next section makes the latter view more probable. 

b (60-2) Moses lived in Egypt for forty years, and the junction of the two 
rivers (Majma ' al-Bahrain) is no other than the junction of the two great branches 
of the Nile at Khartoum. Rabbinical and Hellenistic literature agree that Moses 
went to Ethiopia. Hence a journey to Khartoum, which was near the southern 
boundary of Ethiopia, made in search of knowledge, is most probable. Some 
commentators, however, do not take these words literally, taking the meaning to 
be the union of the rivers of human and Divine knowledge. I would, however, 
suggest that if we accept this journey in the light of an Ascension, it would be an 
indication of the limitation of the Mosaic dispensation. Moses' going on for years 
until he reached the "the junction of the two rivers" would mean that the Mosaic 
dispensation would see its termination after a time, being replaced by one which 
was to be guided by a prophet who is the union of the two seas of human and 
Divine knowledge, or one in whom the temporal and the spiritual would find their 
highest manifestation, this being the Holy Prophet Muhammad. 

c (63) The loss of the fish was, according to a report, to serve as a sign that 
the goal had been attained (Bukhari, 3:44). There is nothing either in the Quran or 
in the Hadith to show that this was a roasted fish. Taking refuge on the rock shows 
that they were staying at a place which was flooded by the river, and Moses' 
companion, when hastening for refuge, forgot to take the fish along with him. The 
wonder is not expressed at the fish having gone down into the river, but because 
he had forgotten to mention the loss to Moses. 



368 18. THE CAVE -18:65 

65 Then they found one of Our servants whom We had granted 
mercy from Us and whom We had taught knowledge from Our- 
selves." 66 Moses said to him: May I follow you that you may 
teach me some of the good you have been taught? 67 He said: Fou 
will not be able to have patience with me. 68 And how can you 
have patience in matters in which you do not have a compre- 
hensive knowledge? 69 He said: If Allah please, you will find me 
patient, nor shall I disobey you in anything. 70 He said: If you would 
follow me, do not question me about anything until I myself speak 
to you about it. 

Section 10: Moses travels in Search of Knowledge 

71 So they set out, until, when they embarked in a boat, he made 
a hole in it. (Moses) said: Have you made a hole in it to drown its 
occupants? Fou have surely done a terrible thing. 72 He said: Did I 
not say that you will not be able to have patience with me? 73 He 
said: Do not blame me for what I forgot, and do not be hard upon 
me for what I did. 

74 So they went on, until, when they met a boy, he killed him. 
(Moses) said: Have you killed an innocent person, not guilty of 
* killing another? Fou have indeed done a horrible thing. * 75 He 
said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to have patience 
with me? 76 He said: If I ask you about anything after this, do not 
keep company with me. Fou will then indeed have found an excuse 
in my case. 

77 So they went on, until, when they came to the people of a 
town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to entertain 
them as guests. Then they found in it a wall which was on the 
point of falling, so he put it into a right state. (Moses) said: If you 
had wished, you could have taken a recompense for it. 78 He said: 
This is the parting between me and you. Now I will inform you of 
the significance of that about which you could not have patience. 

79 As for the boat, it belonged to poor people working on the 



a (65) His name was Khadir (Bukhari, 3:44). 



ss 



18 : 80 "MOSES TRAVELS IN SEARCH OF KNOWLEDGE 369 

river, and I intended to damage it, for there was behind them a 
king who seized every boat by force. 80 And as for the boy, his 
parents were believers and we feared that he might involve them 
in wrongdoing and disbelief." 81 So we intended that their Lord 
might give them in his place one better in purity and nearer to 
mercy. 82 And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in 
the city, and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them, and 
their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord intended that 
they should attain their maturity and take out their treasure — a 
mercy from your Lord — and I did not do it of my own accord. 
This is the significance of that about which you could not have 
patience. 6 



a (80) That the youth himself deserved death is abundantly clear. His inordi- 
nacy had now reached an extreme when it was feared that his innocent parents 
would be involved in the trouble which must befall him as a result of his wrong- 
doing. The circumstances were known to Khadir, though not to Moses. 

b (82) The interpretation of the three incidents shows a manifestation of 
Divine wisdom in what takes place in the everyday life of man. Divine laws, as 
manifested in nature, are really working towards ultimate good, though sometimes 
they may appear to the outward eye to be working to the detriment of somebody. 
The beneficent hand of Allah that works in nature is always directing humanity to 
the goal of great good, though that goal must necessarily be reached with apparent 
loss. Sometimes the loss is only apparent, as in the case of making a hole in the 
boat; there was no real loss, but the apparent loss served a great purpose and 
brought much benefit to the owner. The second instance is that in which there is 
real loss to a person, but it is for the good of humanity at large, for life must be 
sacrificed for the ultimate good of humanity. The third instance shows that, for 
the good of humanity, deeds must be done which bring no immediate reward, and 
that good done by one generation is not devoid of benefit to the next. 

Moses himself had, in fact, to undergo the experience of his teacher, and the 
incidents seem no more than prophetic allegories of Moses' own life-work. Moses 
had to lead his people to a place where they thought they had only been brought to 
be drowned; but their safe passage through the sea showed that it was for their 
good. Then he had to order his men to fight against an iniquitous people and to 
put them to death, but he was not shedding human blood to no purpose, for it was 
really a step towards the evolution of a better race. And finally, his devoting his 
own life to the Israelites, descendants of a righteous man, corresponded to his 
teacher's building the wall for the orphans without claiming recompense. Read in 
this light, the narration is clearly an Ascension of Moses, foreshadowing the great 
events which were to befall him. 



370 18. THE CAVE -18:83 

Section 1 1 : Dhu-1-qarnain and Gog and Magog 

83 And they ask you about Dhu-1-qarnain." Say: I will recite 
to you an account of him. 84 Truly We established him (with 
power) in the land and granted him means of access to everything; 
8S so he followed a course. 86 Until, when he reached the setting- 
place of the sun, he found it going down into a black sea, e and 
found by it a people. We said: O Dhu-1-qarnain, either punish 
them or do them a benefit. 87 He said: As for him who is unjust, we 
shall punish him, then he will be returned to his Lord, and He will 
punish him with an exemplary punishment. 88 And as for him who 



a (83) Dhu-1-qarnain literally means the two-horned one, or one belonging 
to two generations or two centuries. The reference here seems to be to the two- 
horned ram of Daniel's vision (Daniel, 8:3), which he interpreted as the Kingdoms 
of Media and Persia, which were combined into a single kingdom under one ruler, 
Cyrus, who is erroneously called Darius in the Bible (Encyclopedia Biblica and 
Jewish Encyclopedia, Art. 'Darius'). The reference in Daniel's vision is, however, 
not to Cyrus but to Darius I Hystaspes (521-485 B.C.), "who allowed the Jews to 
rebuild their temple... His liberality towards the Jews is in complete accord with 
what we know otherwise of his general policy in religious matters towards the 
subject nations" (Enc. Biblica, 'Darius'). 

The reference in the Quran in the history of Dhu-1-qarnain is to Darius I: 
"Darius was the organizer of the Persian Empire. His conquests served to round 
off the boundaries of his realm in Armenia, the Caucasus, and India, and along the 
Turanian steppes and the highlands of Central Asia" (Jewish Enc, 'Darius I'). 
The following remarks in the Encyclopaedia Britannica strengthen this view: 
"Darius in his inscriptions appears as a fervent believer in the true religion of 
Zoroaster. But he was also a great statesman and organizer. The time of conquests 
had come to an end; the wars which Darius undertook, like those of Augustus, 
only served the purpose of gaining strong natural frontiers for the empire and 
keeping down the barbarous tribes on its borders. Thus Darius subjugated the wild 
nations of the Pontic and Armenian mountains, and extended the Persian domi- 
nion to the Caucasus; for the same reason he fought against the Sacae and other 
Turanian tribes". The references to Darius being a fervent believer in the true 
religion of Zoroaster, to his subduing the barbarous tribes on the borders, to his 
gaining strong natural frontiers for the empire, and to his fighting against the 
Sacae clearly point him out as the Dhu-1-qamain of the Quran. 

b (86-1) This signifies the western-most point of his empire. 

c (86-2) The place referred to is no other than the Black Sea, as, Armenia 
being within the Kingdom of Persia, the Black Sea formed the northwestern boun- 
dary of the empire.

believes and does good, for him is a good reward, and We shall 
speak to him an easy word of Our command." 

89 Then he followed a course. 90 Until, when he reached (the 
land of) the rising sun, he found it rising on a people to whom We 
had given no shelter from it — 91 so it was. And We had full 
knowledge of what he had. 

92 Then he followed a course. 93 Until, when he reached (a 
place) between the two mountains, he found on that side of them a 
people who could hardly understand a word.' 94 They said: Dhu-1- 
qarnain, Gog and Magog do mischief in the land. May we then 
pay you tribute on condition that you raise a barrier between us 
and them? 95 He said: The power with which my Lord has 



a (88) Being a true follower of Zoroaster, the well-known Persian prophet, 
Darius seems to have invited these tribes to his religion. 

b (90) Darius goes first westward to the Black Sea (v. 85-86). Then he 
undertakes an eastward journey — the land of the rising sun. The description of 
the people found here, a people who had no shelter from the sun, is a description 
of the barbarous aboriginal tribes on the shores of the Caspian. 

c (93) The three journeys alluded to seem to have been undertaken with the 
object of strengthening the frontiers of the empire, the most important of these 
being that spoken of here, the part of the frontier between the Caspian and the 
Black Seas, where the Caucasus afforded a natural protection against the attacks 
of the Scythians. The two mountains are the mountains of Armenia and Azarbai- 
jan. The people settling there spoke a different language and could not understand 
the Iranian language. 

rf(94) In the Bible, Ezekiel 38:2 contains the words: "Son of man, set your 
face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, 
and prophesy against him". North of the Caucasus we find two rivers bearing the 
names of Tobol and Moskva, on the latter of which is situated the ancient city of 
Moscow, and on the former the more recent town of Tobolsk. It seems almost 
certain that these two rivers received their names from the two tribes of Ezekiel 
38:2, the Tubal and Meshech, and then gave their names to the two above- 
mentioned cities. This view is in accordance with the opinion of ancient writers 
like Josephus, who settle the Magog north of the Caucasus. Thus the name Magog 
stands for tribes which occupied territories to the north and north-east of the Black 
Sea, tribes which gave their names directly or indirectly to the towns of Tobolsk 
and Moscow. 

Another point worth considering is the presence of the gigantic effigies of 
Gog and Magog in Guildhall, London, which can be traced to a very early period

established me is better, so if only you help me with strength (of 
men), I will make a fortified barrier between you and them: 
"Bring me blocks of iron." At length, when he had filled up the 
space between the two mountain sides, he said, Blow. Till, when 
he had made it (as) fire, he said: Bring me molten brass to pour 
over it. 

97 So they were not able to scale it, nor could they make a 
hole in it. 98 He said: This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the 
promise of my Lord comes to pass He will crumble it, and the 
promise of my Lord is ever true.* "And on that day We shall let 

in English history. This makes it probable that the Angles or the Saxons had in 
very ancient times some connection with the Scythians or other tribes living north 
of the Caucasus or the Black Sea. It may be deduced from this that the ancestors 
of the present Teutonic and Slav races, the main nations of eastern and western 
Europe respectively, are the Gog and Magog spoken of in the Quran, both these 
races originating from the same land. 

The next statement, that the tribes found by Darius between Azerbaijan and 
the Armenian mountains were constantly harassed by their northern neighbours, 
the Scythians, is also borne out by history. "About 512 Darius undertook a war 
against the Scythians . . . The purpose of this war can only have been to attack the 
nomadic Turanian tribes in the rear, and thus to secure peace on the northern fron- 
tier of the empire" (Encyclopaedia Britannica, Art. 'Darius'). 

The barrier referred to in this and the following verses is the famous wall at 
Derbent, on the western shore of the Caspian, which had iron gates and numerous 
watch-towers for defence. Its name, Alexander's wall, is a misnomer due to the 
mistake made by Muslim historians in supposing Dhu-1-qamain to be Alexander. 

a (96) The blocks of iron were needed for the iron gates in the wall. 

b (98) From the historical narration of the past, the subject is now changed to 
the future. Gog and Magog are described as two nations, and after describing the 
history of these nations, whose depredations on peaceful nations were brought to 
an end by Darius, we are now told that Gog and Magog will again be let loose in 
the latter days. In fact, this is clearly foretold in another chapter of the same 
period: "when Gog and Magog are let loose and they sally forth from every ele- 
vated place" (21:96). The crumbling of the wall which withheld Gog and Magog 
for a time is thus explained by the Quran itself as the letting loose of Gog and 
Magog. Just as the building of the wall indicated the confinement of Gog and 
Magog to their own territorial bounds, the crumbling of the wall means that they 
will at some future time be let loose and will then dominate the whole world. This 
domination is spoken of in the Hadith in various ways. According to one hadith, 
"No one will have the power to fight against them" (Sahih Muslim, 52:20). 



1 8 : 100 • DHU-L-QARNAIN AND GOG AND MAGOG 373 

some of them surge against others and the trumpet will be blown, 
then We shall gather them all together," 100 and We shall bring 
forth hell, exposed to view, on that day before the disbelievers, 6 
101 whose eyes were under a cover from My Reminder, and they 
could not bear to hear. e 



According to another, "they will drink the water of the whole world" {Kanaz al- 
'Ummal, vol. 7, p. 2157). As shown earlier, the ancestors of Gog and Magog are 
the Slav and Teutonic races, and in the world-domination of Gog and Magog is 
thus clearly hinted the domination of the European nations over the whole world, 
and the prophecy has thus found fulfilment in our days. 

a (99) A mighty conflict of nations is clearly spoken of here, and the words 
no doubt refer to some catastrophe like that which is predicted in the Gospels in 
the words: "For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 
And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. All 
these are the beginning of sorrows" (Matthew, 24:7-8). 

The Quran makes it clear that the reference in nation rising against nation is 
to the great European conflicts of modern times. Gog and Magog, or the European 
nations, having subdued the whole world, could not agree on the division of the 
spoils, and they are rushing at one another's throats, and the whole world being 
subject to them, their struggle has assumed the form of a world conflict. But if the 
first part of the verse speaks of the destruction due to these wars, the second part 
raises a great hope. A mighty Revolution will come about. That is what is meant 
by the blowing of the trumpet. The revolution would unite them; it would drive 
them to one common faith. Material benefits having turned man into the enemy of 
man, a spiritual awakening will, we are told, be brought about which will change 
the world entirely. Instead of cutting one another's throats people will learn to 
love one another, and they will all be but one nation. There is a broad enough hint 
here at the nation of Islam, for there is but one faith, the faith of Islam, which has 
been able to weld diverse people into one whole. The day of peace for this world 
will dawn with the dawning of the idea on the mind of man that there is only a 
single nation, the human nation, that lives on this earth: "Mankind is a single 
nation" (2:213). 

b (100) These words complete the picture of the great conflict spoken of in 
the previous verse. It describes the severity of the conflict, which will reduce the 
world to a veritable hell. There was hell raging on this earth in World War 2. 
What a World War 3 may bring, no one can say. 

c (101) The reason is given in these words why these disasters will be 
brought on man: These are people whose eyes are under a cover from My Remin- 
der. In fact, they are so estranged from God that they cannot even bear to hear 
His Reminder. So thoroughly have lust and greed engrossed the civilized world! 



374 18. THE CAVE -18:102 

Section 12: Christian Nations 

102 Do those who disbelieve think that they can take My 
servants to be protectors besides Me? a Surely We have prepared 
hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers. 103 Say: Shall We 
inform you who are the greatest losers in respect of deeds? 
104 Those whose effort is lost in this world's life, and they think 
that they are making good manufactures. 105 Those are they who 
disbelieve in the messages of their Lord and meeting with Him, so 
their deeds are fruitless. Nor shall We set up a balance for them on 
the day of Resurrection. c 106 That is their reward — hell, because 
they disbelieved and held My messages and My messengers in 
mockery. 

107 As for those who believe and do good deeds, for them are 
Gardens of Paradise, an entertainment, 108 to abide therein; they 
will not desire removal from there. 109 Say: If the sea were ink for 
the words of my Lord, the sea would surely be exhausted before 
the words of my Lord were exhausted, even if We brought as 
much again to add (to it). 110 Say: I am only a mortal like you — 



a (102) The Christians are meant here, because theirs is the most prominent 
example of having taken a servant of Allah, a prophet, for God. In fact, Jesus 
Christ is the only person whom the Quran recognizes as a righteous servant of 
God and who has been taken for God by a large part of the world. 

b (104) This is a clear description of the present attitude of the civilized 
nations to their moral and spiritual needs — their effort is entirely wasted in this 
world's life, and they cannot give a moment's consideration to the life after death. 
The portrait of the material civilization, to which Christianity has led, as drawn in 
this section, attains to its most vivid clearness in these words. Manufacture is the 
one speciality and pride of the West. But they are so engrossed in the contest of 
manufactures that they have no thought of God left in their minds. 

c (105) Their deeds are fruitless because what they do relates to the vanities 
of life. They have no vision for the higher values of life, for the ultimate end, 
which is here spoken of as the meeting with the Lord. Hence we are told that no 
balance will be set up for them on the day of Resurrection, because all their deeds 
relate to this life, and end where this life ends. 

d (109) In these words there is a refutation of the Christian doctrine that "the 
word was with God", or that "the word was God" (John 1:1). The words of God 
are so numerous, we are here told, that the sea would be exhausted, if it were to

serve as ink for writing them. In fact, everything created is a word of God accord- 
ing to the Quran, and things created know no end. 



Chapter 19 

Maryam Mary 

The name of this chapter is taken from the story of Mary, mother of Jesus. It 
begins with an account of the birth of John and of Jesus, the last representa- 
tives of prophecy in the house of Israel, and then refutes the doctrine of the 
Divine sonship of Jesus. It then mentions the missions of some earlier pro- 
phets, showing that only human beings are raised to reform the world. At the 
end the doctrine that Jesus is the son of God is again denounced. This chapter 
was revealed in the early period at Makkah, about or before the fifth year of 
the Holy Prophet's mission. 



Section 1 : Zacharias and John 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.

2 A mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zacharias — 
3 when he called upon his Lord, crying in secret. 4 He said: My 
Lord, my bones are weakened, and my head flares with whiteness 
(of hair), and I have never been unsuccessful in my prayer to You, 
my Lord. 5 And I fear my kinsfolk after me, and my wife is barren, 
so grant me from Yourself an heir Svho should inherit me and 
inherit from the Children of Jacob, and make him, my Lord, 
acceptable (to You). 

7 O Zacharias, We give you good news of a boy, whose name 
is John: We have not made before anyone his equal. c 8 He said: 



a (1) The original Arabic consists of the letters kaf, ha, ya, 'ain and sad. 
These stand for the words Kaf-in (Sufficient), Had-in (Guide), YamTn (Blessed), 
'Alim (Knowing), and Sadiq (Truthful). 

b (6) His fear was due to their not leading righteous lives, and he feared there 
would be none to lead people into the ways of righteousness after him. The inheri- 
tance of the Children of Jacob is the inheritance of the Divine blessing of prophet- 
hood, which had been promised to Jacob's children. 

c (7) It is not, of course, meant that one like John or equal to him was never

19:9- MARY AND JESUS 377 

My Lord, how shall I have a son, and my wife is barren, and I 
have reached extreme old age? 9 He said: So (it will be). Four Lord 
says: It is easy to Me, and indeed I created you before, when you 
were nothing. 10 He said: My Lord, give me a sign. He said: Four 
sign is that you do not speak to people three nights, being in sound 
health." n So he went forth to his people from the sanctuary and 
proclaimed to them: Glorify (Allah) morning and evening. 

12 O John, take hold of the Book with strength. And We gran- 
ted him wisdom when a child, 13 and kind-heartedness from Us and 
purity. And he was dutiful, 14 and kindly to his parents, and he was 
not insolent, disobedient.* 15 And peace on him the day he was 
born and the day he died, and the day he is raised to life! 

Section 2: Mary and Jesus 

16 And mention Mary in the Book. When she drew aside from 
her family to an eastern place; 17 so she screened herself from them. 
Then We sent to her Our spirit and it appeared to her as a well- 
made man. c 18 She said: I seek refuge from you in the Beneficent, 

before created in the world. According to the Gospels: "among those born of 
women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist" (Matthew, 11:11). 
The meaning is that one like him was not born in Zacharias' family, because in 
the previous verse it is his own relatives about whom Zacharias says that he feared, 
and therefore an assurance was now given to him that the promised son would not 
be like the other members of his family regarding whom he feared. Or the meaning 
may be that one like him had not appeared in that age. 

a (10) In 3:41 the words are three days, thus showing that three days and three 
nights are meant. The Quran does not support the idea that Zacharias was struck 
dumb, because it speaks of him as being in sound health. The object of assuming 
silence was to be engaged solely in prayer to the Divine Being, and hence Zacharias 
told his people also to glorify God. 

b (14) The various aspects of the character of John deserve to be noted. He 
was pure and sinless and never disobeyed God. In fact, what is said of one pro- 
phet is equally true of all. They are all pure from birth, and never disobey God. 

c (17) It was in a vision that the spirit came, and the conversation that 
follows also took place in a vision. The word tamaththala ("it appeared") lends 
support to this, for it signifies assuming the likeness of another thing, and this 
happens only in a vision. Further, the spirit or angel of God appears to His chosen 
ones only in a vision.

if you are one guarding against evil. 19 He said: I am only bearer of 
a message of your Lord: That I will give you a pure boy. a 20 She 
said: How can I have a son and man has not yet touched me, nor 
have I been unchaste? 21 He said: So (it will be). Four Lord says: It 
is easy to Me; and that We may make him a sign to people and a 
mercy from Us. And it is a matter decreed. 6 

22 Then she conceived him, and withdrew with him to a 
remote place. 23 And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk 
of a palm-tree. She said: Oh, I wish I had died before this, and 
had been a thing quite forgotten! 6 24 So a voice came to her from 
beneath her: Do not grieve, surely your Lord has provided a 
stream beneath you. 25 And shake towards you the trunk of the 
palm-tree, it will drop on you fresh ripe dates. 26 So eat and drink 



a (19) The words / will give you a pure boy are the words of the message. 
The Spirit only conveyed the Divine message. Every word of the Quran is the 
word of God, but every word was delivered to the Holy Prophet by the angel. 

b (21-1) Jesus was a sign to people, in the sense that he was made a prophet, 
and every prophet is a sign, because the Divine revelation granted to him affords a 
clear proof of the existence of the Divine Being. Or, he was a sign to the Israelites 
in particular, because with him prophethood came to an end among the Israelites. 

c (21-2) She conceived him in the ordinary way in which women conceive 
children. 

d (23-1) This shows that Mary gave birth to Jesus while on a journey; hence 
the reference to water and food in v. 24 and 25, such as one can only find in a 
journey. That she was going to a distant place is shown by v. 22. She may have 
had recourse to the trunk of a palm-tree to find a support in the throes of child- 
birth. 

e (23-2) Mary gave birth to Jesus under the ordinary circumstances which 
women experience in giving birth to children. The throes of childbirth were too 
severe for her to bear, and hence she gave utterance to such words. The reference 
to the pains of childbirth clearly shows that an ordinary human child was coming 
into the world. Or, there may be a reference to Genesis 3:16, In pain you shall 
bring forth children. 

/(25) The Quran does not accept that Jesus was born on 25th December. It 
was the time when fresh ripe dates are found on palm-trees. It is now a recognized 
fact that 25th December was not Jesus' birthday. According to the birth account in 
Luke 2:8, shepherds were keeping watch over their flocks by night in the fields, 
which shows that it was not winter. The 25th of December was taken from the 
birthday of the Persian sun-god Mithra.

and be comforted. Then if you see any mortal, say: Surely I have 
vowed a fast to the Beneficent, so I will not speak to anyone

27 Then she came to her people with him, carrying him. 
They said: Mary, you have indeed brought a strange thing! e 
28 Sister of Aaron,'' jour father was not a wicked man, nor was 
your mother an unchaste woman! 29 But she pointed to him. They 
said: How should we speak to one who is a child in the cradle? e 
30 He said: I am indeed a servant of Allah. He has given me the 



a (26) It was really a kind of fast. Zacharias, as we have already seen, was 
told not to speak to people for three days. 

b (27-1) The conversation in v. 27-33 is alone sufficient to make it clear that 
this incident relates to a time when Jesus had grown up sufficiently to have been 
appointed a prophet and to have received Divine revelation. The Quran does not 
relate stories in all their details, and often omits a number of incidents which are 
not needed for its purpose. For instance, v. 1 1 relates only Zacharias' receiving 
the joyful news of a son, while v. 12 asks that son to take hold of the Book with 
strength. Jesus could only say that he was made a prophet when he was actually 
entrusted with the mission of a prophet, and not before. Moreover, it is unreason- 
able to suppose that, as soon as Mary gave birth to the child, she took it to her 
people to make a show of it. The word carrying does not show that she was carry- 
ing him in her arms; it means that he was being carried on an animal. Compare 
9:92, where some of the companions are spoken of as coming to the Prophet that 
he might carry them, and he is related as replying that he did not have that on 
which to carry them, i.e. animals. Compare Matthew 21:1-7 where the story is 
related of Jesus entering Jerusalem riding an ass, or an ass and a colt. 

c (27-2) The reference in Mary's bringing a strange thing may be to her 
having given birth to a son who claimed greater authority than the elders of Israel, 
with a deeper hint to the calumny against her, for which see 4:156. In his reply 
Jesus does not make a single reference to the circumstances of his birth. Hence 
the inference is quite reasonable that the question was directed against the mission 
of Jesus and not against the circumstances of his birth. 

d (28) The fact that Mary was devoted to the Temple from the age of three to 
twelve years shows that she belonged to the priestly class, being of the Levitical 
race. Hence she is called sister of Aaron. The word ukht, meaning sister, is by no 
means limited to the close blood-relationship. 

e (29) Old and learned Jews would no doubt speak of a young man who was 
born and brought up before their eyes as a child in the cradle, as if disdaining to 
address one so young.

Book and made me a prophet, 31 and He has made me blessed 
wherever I may be, and He has enjoined on me prayer and the due 
charity so long as I live," 32 and to be kind to my mother; and He 
has not made me insolent, unblessed. 33 And peace on me the day 
I was born, and the day I die, and the day I am raised to life. 

34 Such is Jesus son of Mary — a statement of truth about 
which they dispute. 35 It does not befit Allah that He should take to 
Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decrees a matter He 
only says to it, Be, and it is. 36 And surely Allah is my Lord and 
your Lord, so serve Him. This is the right path. c 37 But factions 
from among them differed; so woe to those who disbelieve, 
because of their presence on a grievous day! 38 How clearly will 
they hear and see on the day when they come to Us; but the wrong- 
doers are today in manifest error. 39 And warn them of the day of 
Regret, when the matter is decided. And they are (now) in negli- 
gence and they do not believe. 40 Surely We inherit the earth and 
those on it, and to Us they are returned. 



a (31) It is clear that this conversation did not take place when Jesus was an 
infant in the cradle, but when he had actually been made a prophet. It is absurd to 
suppose that prayers and charity were enjoined on Jesus while he was only a day 
old and that he really observed these injunctions at that age. Jesus' answer clearly 
shows that he was addressing his people after he had been entrusted with the 
mission of prophethood. 

b (32) Here only the mother is spoken of, whereas in a similar case in v. 14 
John is spoken of as being kind to both parents. This may be due to the fact that 
Joseph may not have been living at the time when Jesus spoke these words. 
Joseph was already an old man when he married Mary, and by the time that the 
ministry of Jesus begins we find no mention of him even in the Gospels, the 
mother and brothers being the only relations mentioned. Or, the mother alone is 
mentioned because the Gospels relate an incident showing that Jesus was rude to 
his mother (Matthew, 12:48), and this verse disproves the statement, it being one 
of the objects of the Quran to clear Jesus of all false charges. 

c (36) According to Matthew, when Jesus was tempted of the devil, who 
asked him to worship him, Jesus' reply was: "For it is written, You shall worship 
the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve" (Matthew, 4: 10). 

d (39) The day of Judgment is here called the day of Regret, because man 
will then regret that he wasted the opportunity given to him to work for his own 
good. 



19 : 41 • ABRAHAM 381 

Section 3: Abraham 

41 And mention Abraham in the Book. Surely he was a truthful 
man, a prophet. 42 When he said to his sire: My sire, why do you 
worship something which does not hear, nor see, nor can it avail 
you at all? 43 My sire, to me indeed has come the knowledge which 
has not come to you; so follow me, I will guide you on a right path. 
44 My sire, do not serve the devil. Surely the devil is disobedient to 
the Beneficent. 45 My sire, surely I fear that a punishment from the 
Beneficent may afflict you, so that you become a friend of the 
devil. 

46 He said: Do you dislike my gods, Abraham? If you do not 
stop, I will certainly drive you away. And leave me for a time. 
47 He said: Peace be on you! I shall pray my Lord to forgive you. 
Surely He is ever Kind to me. 48 And I withdraw from you and 
what you call on besides Allah, and I call upon my Lord. Maybe I 
shall not remain unblessed in calling upon my Lord. 

49 So when he withdrew from them and what they worshipped 
besides Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. And each (of them) 
We made a prophet. 50 And We gave them of Our mercy, and We 
granted them a truthful mention of eminence. 4 

Section 4: Other Prophets are raised 

51 And mention Moses in the Book. Surely he was one 
purified, and was a messenger, a prophet/ 52 And We called to him 



a (49) It is elsewhere made clear that Jacob was his grandson (11:71, 21:72). 
Nor should it be supposed that giving signifies only the giving of a son, for of 
Moses it is said in v. 53, We gave him his brother Aaron, a prophet, though Aaron 
was older than Moses. 

b (50) However humble a life a prophet may lead, he is granted an eminence 
among later generations, and the record of eminence of a prophet is a truthful one. 

c (51) Rasul, or messenger, means one who is sent with a message for the re- 
generation of people, while nabi, or prophet, is one who has the gift of prophecy, 
i.e., who receives a naba ' or information from on high. The elect who are chosen 
for the regeneration of man are called prophets as receiving knowledge from 
Allah, and messengers as delivering to humanity the messages they receive.

from the blessed side of the mountain, and We made him draw 
near to Us in communion. 53 And We gave him out of Our mercy 
his brother Aaron, a prophet. 54 And mention Ishmael in the Book. 
Surely he was truthful in promise, and he was a messenger, a 
prophet." 55 And he enjoined on his people prayer and charity, and 
was one in whom his Lord was well pleased. 56 And mention Idrls 
in the Book. Surely he was a truthful man, a prophet, 57 and We 
raised him to an elevated state. 

58 These are they on whom Allah bestowed favours, from 
among the prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom 
We carried with Noah, and of the offspring of Abraham and 
Israel, and of those whom We guided and chose. When the 
messages of the Beneficent were recited to them, they fell down in 
submission, weeping. 59 But after them came an evil generation, 
who wasted prayers and followed lusts, so they will meet with 
ruin, 60 except those who repent and believe and do good — such 
will enter the Garden, and they will not be wronged in the least: 
"Gardens of perpetuity which the Beneficent has promised to His 
servants, in the Unseen. Surely His promise ever comes to pass. 
62 They will hear therein no vain discourse, but only, Peace! c And 
they have their sustenance therein, morning and evening. 63 This is 
the Garden which We cause those of Our servants to inherit who 
keep their duty. 



a (54) When Abraham prayed to the Lord "that Ishmael might live before 
You", the reply was: "And as for Ishmael, I have heard you" (Genesis, 17:18, 20), 
which shows that Ishmael was made a prophet. See also 2:124-125, footnotes. 

b (57) Idrls is the same as Enoch of the Bible. The word raf, which is used 
of Jesus, is also used of Enoch, and some commentators therefore misinterpret it 
as indicating that Enoch was taken up to heaven alive. But the same mistake is 
made in both cases, for raf signifies raising to high dignity; see 3:55 footnote 2. 
The mistake seems to have arisen from what is said of Enoch in the Bible: "And 
Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him" (Genesis, 5:24). 

c (62) This description of the Hereafter shows that the Muslim in this world 
talks of nothing but peace. Islam is really peace, and it is by making peace here 
with the Creator and His creatures that one can find peace hereafter. This is the 
great truth underlying the Islamic idea of paradise. The state of perfect peace 
spoken of here is called the Garden in v. 63 which the righteous will inherit.

Section 5: How the Opponents were dealt with 

66 And says man: When I am dead, shall I truly be brought 
forth alive? 67 Does not man remember that We created him before, 
when he was nothing? 68 So by your Lord! We shall certainly gather 
them together and the devils, 6 then shall We bring them around hell 
on their knees. 69 Then We shall draw forth from every group those 
most rebellious against the Beneficent. 70 Again, We certainly know 
best those who deserve most to be burned in it. 71 And there is not 
one of you but shall come to it. c This is an unavoidable decree of 
your Lord. 

72 And We shall deliver those who guard against evil, and 
leave the wrongdoers in it on their knees. 73 And when Our clear 
messages are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those 
who believe: Which of the two groups is better in position and 
better assembled? 6 74 And how many a generation have We 



a (64) As the angels brought revelation to previous prophets (indicated in the 
words we do not descend), so they now bring revelation, by the command of the 
Lord, to the Holy Prophet Muhammad. The words, your Lord is never forgetful, 
signify that the promises and prophecies made by God through His prophets could 
not be forgotten. Thus, after an account of the previous prophets, the subject moves 
to the revelation of the Holy Prophet for the remainder of the chapter. 

b (68) The devils here are clearly those humans who lead others to evil. 

c (71) The wicked only are spoken of, as the context shows clearly. That the 
righteous will not go to hell is made clear further on: "The day when We gather 
the dutiful to the Beneficent to receive honours, and drive the guilty to hell, as 
thirsty beasts" (v. 85-86). According to 21:102, the righteous will not hear the 
faintest sound of hell. 

d (72) The word thumma, the first word of this verse, frequently means and, 
besides its meaning of then. It is wrong to suppose that the righteous will be first 
cast into hell and then delivered. 

e (73) That is, they are proud of their great wealth and numerous forces.

destroyed before them, who had better possessions and appearance! 
75 Say: As for him who is in error, the Beneficent will prolong his 
length of days; until they see what they were threatened with, 
either the punishment or the Hour." Then they will know who is 
worse in position and weaker in forces.* 76 And Allah increases in 
guidance those who go aright. And the ever-abiding, the good 
works, are better with your Lord in reward and yield better return. 

77 Have you seen him who disbelieves in Our messages and 
says: I shall certainly be given wealth and children? c 78 Has he 
gained knowledge of the unseen, or received a promise from the 
Beneficent? 79 By no means! We write down what he says, and We 
shall lengthen to him the length of the punishment, 80 and We shall 
inherit from him what he says, and he will come to Us alone. d 
81 And they have taken gods besides Allah, that they should be to 
them a source of strength — 82 By no means! They will soon deny 
their worshipping them, and be their adversaries. 

Section 6: False Doctrine of Sonship 

83 Do you not see that We send the devils against the disbelie- 
vers, inciting them provokingly? 84 So make no haste against them. 
We only number out to them a number (of days). 85 The day when 
We gather the dutiful to the Beneficent to receive honours, 86 and 
drive the guilty to hell, as thirsty beasts. 87 They have no power of 
intercession, except him who has made a covenant with the 
Beneficent. 



a (75-1) The Hour signifies the hour of doom, when their power will be 
utterly destroyed. In comparison with this is the lighter "punishment". 

b (75-2) In these words it is clearly indicated that the time will come when 
they will find themselves in an evil condition, and their forces weaker than the 
forces of Truth. 

c (77) They have no eye for the higher values of life; all they want is wealth 
and children or followers. 

rf(80) The reference is to his saying in v. 77: "I shall certainly be given 
wealth and children". God's inheriting thus means that their wealth and children 
will be taken away from them and ultimately be a source of strength to Islam. 



19 : 88 • FALSE DOCTRINE OF SONSHIP 385 

88 And they say: The Beneficent has taken to Himself a son. 
"'Certainly you make a detestable assertion! 90 The heavens may 
almost be torn apart at it, and the earth split, and the mountains 
crumble down in pieces, 91 that they ascribe a son to the Beneficent! 
92 And it is not worthy of the Beneficent that He should take to Him- 
self a son." 93 There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes 
to the Beneficent as a servant. 94 Certainly He comprehends them, 
and has numbered them all. 95 And everyone of them will come to 
Him on the day of Resurrection, alone. 

96 Those who believe and do good deeds, for them the Bene- 
ficent will surely bring about love.* 97 So We have made it easy in 
jour tongue, only that you should give good news by it to those who 
guard against evil, and should warn by it a contentious people. 
98 And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! 
Can you see anyone of them or hear a sound of them? 



a (92) Verses 89-93 contain a most emphatic and clear condemnation of the 
Christian doctrine of the Godhead of Jesus Christ. As this chapter belongs to about 
the fifth year of the Holy Prophet's mission, it shows that Islam had set before 
itself from the very first the grand object of the reformation of Christianity. The 
particular point on which stress is laid in this chapter, as against the fundamental 
errors of the Christian religion, Sonship and Atonement, is that God is Rahman 
(Beneficent), and does not require any compensation to forgive sinners. It is for 
this reason that the name Rahman, in preference to all other names of the Divine 
Being, is mentioned over and over again in this chapter, and the key to the whole 
position is contained in v. 92 in the words: // is not worthy of the Beneficent that 
He should take to Himself a son. In fact, the doctrine of Atonement is contradicted 
by Christ's own words in the Lord's prayer: "And forgive us our debts as we 
forgive our debtors" (Matthew, 6:12). A man is said to forgive his debtor when he 
remits the debt and does not exact any compensation. Even thus does God forgive 
sinners; He needs no compensation. 

b (96) Allah's bringing about love for the righteous means that He loves 
them Himself and inspires love for them in the hearts of other people, while they 
also love Allah as well as their fellow-beings. The righteous servants of God are 
opposed at first, but gradually their goodness prevails and they are loved and 
admired. There is a prophetic reference here to the great love with which the hearts 
of the enemies of the Prophet were to be inspired in the near future, and even 
today the hearts of people are being inspired with greater and greater love for him 
as the world witnesses the good which he did to humanity. 



Chapter 20 
Ta Ha 

The initial letters of this chapter serve as its title. Beginning by declaring 
that the Quran was revealed to be triumphant in the world, it deals at length 
with the story of Moses, showing how he was ultimately successful. It 
follows this by a description of the opposition to the Prophet Muhammad and 
the consequences of that opposition. This chapter was revealed in the early 
period at Makkah, about or before the fifth year of the Holy Prophet's 



Section 1 : Moses is called 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O man," 2 We have not revealed the Quran to you that you 
may be unsuccessful; 3 but it is a reminder to him who fears: 
4 a revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens. e 
5 The Beneficent is established on the Throne of Power. 6 To Him 
belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth 
and whatever is between them and whatever is beneath the soil. 
7 And if you utter the saying aloud, surely He knows the secret 
(that you hide), and what is yet more hidden. "Allah — there is 
no God but He. His are the most beautiful names. 



a (1) Ta ha, a combination of the two letters ta and ha, is, according to 
various early commentators, a word meaning O man. It is also considered to be a 
name of the Holy Prophet. 

b (2) That is, it could not be that the Prophet, to whom the Quran was revealed, 
should remain unsuccessful in bringing about the transformation for which it was 
revealed. It is a consolation, and a clear prophecy, that a mighty transformation 
will be brought about, not only in Arabia but in the whole world, for that was the 
object which the Quran had set out to accomplish from the first. 

c (4) The Quran cannot be a failure, because it is a manifestation of the will 
of Him Who holds sway over all. 

d (7) The secret is what a man hides in his heart, and what is yet more hidden 
is what is in the subconscious mind. Both are known alike to Allah.

20 : 9 • MOSES IS CALLED 387 

9 And has the story of Moses come to .you? 10 When he saw a 
fire, he said to his family: Wait, I see a fire; maybe I will bring to 
you a live coal from it or find guidance at the fire." 11 So when he 
came to it, a voice came: O Moses, 12 surely I am your Lord, so 
take off jour shoes; surely you are in the sacred valley Tuwa. 
13 And I have chosen you so listen to what is revealed: 14 Surely I 
am Allah, there is no God but I, so serve Me, and keep up prayer 
for My remembrance. 15 Surely the Hour is coming — I am about to 
make it manifest c — so that every soul may be rewarded as it 
strives. 16 So do not let him who does not believe in it, and follows 
his low desire, turn you away from it, so that you perish. 

17 And what is this in jour right hand, O Moses? 18 He said: 
This is my staff — I lean on it, and I beat leaves with it for my 
sheep, and I have other uses for it. 19 He said: Throw it down, 
O Moses. 20 So he threw it down, and lo! it was a snake, gliding."' 



a (10) As the verses that follow show, Moses received a Divine revelation on 
this occasion, and his seeing the fire was also a part of the revelation; it was with 
the spiritual eye that he saw it. The Quran has stated elsewhere that revelation is 
received only in three ways (42:51), and in each of these the recipient is really 
given particular senses with which to feel and see things. 

b (12) The command to take off the shoes is a metaphorical expression for 
making the heart vacant from care for family and property. According to some, it 
is a command to stay (as if to say, make yourself at home). 

c (15) Ikhfa is one of the words which convey contrary significances, con- 
cealing or removing that which conceals a thing. But that here it does not mean 
concealing is made clear by the context. It is the coming of the Hour and the 
meting out of rewards and punishments that the verse deals with, which is clearly 
removing the veil or making the hour manifest. Note that the Hour does not 
necessarily signify the Resurrection; on the other hand, it very often indicates the 
doom of a people, the hour of the departure of their glory and power. 

d (20) All this was experienced by Moses in that particular state in which the 
recipient of a revelation finds himself at the time of the revelation; see 7:108 foot- 
note. What was shown to Moses on this occasion had a deeper significance; see v. 
23, where the object of showing these signs is stated to be that We may show you 
of Our greater signs. Thus the two signs mentioned here were really indications 
of something greater. The word 'asa (staff) stands metaphorically for a community. 
Hence the sight of his staff becoming a gliding serpent was shown to him as an 
indication that his community, i.e., the Israelites, who had been reduced to a state 
of slavery under Pharaoh, would soon become a living nation. 



388 20. TAHA -20:21 

21 He said: Take hold of it and do not fear. We shall return it to its 
former state. 22 And press your hand to your side, it will come out 
white without harm — another sign:" 23 that We may show you of 
Our greater signs. 24 Go to Pharaoh, surely he has exceeded the 
limits. 

Section 2: Moses and Aaron go to Pharaoh 

25 He said: My Lord, expand my breast for me (with know- 
ledge), 26 and ease my task for me, 27 and loosen the knot from my 
tongue, ' 28 (that) they may understand my word. 29 And give to me 
a helper from my family, 30 Aaron, my brother; 31 add to my strength 
by him, 32 and make him share my task — 33 so that we may glorify 
You much, 34 and much remember You. 35 Surely, You are ever 
seeing us. 

36 He said: You are indeed granted your petition, O Moses. 
37 And indeed We bestowed on you a favour at another time, 
38 when We revealed to your mother what was revealed: 39 Put him 
into a chest, then put it into the river, the river will cast it upon the 
shore — there an enemy to Me and an enemy to him shall take 
him up. And I shed on you love from Me; and that you may be 
brought up before My eyes. e 40 When your sister went and said: 
Shall I direct you to one who will take charge of him? So We 
brought you back to your mother that she might be comforted and 
she should not grieve. And you killed a man, then We delivered 
you from grief, and tried you with (many) trials. Then you stayed 
for years among the people of Midian. Then you came here as 



a (22) Bearing in mind what has been said above, this has also a deeper 
meaning. A white hand signifies an argument made very clear. The deeper signi- 
ficance in this case was that his arguments would prevail. 

b (27) By a man who has a knot in his tongue is meant a man unable to 
speak freely. 

c (39) Moses was born at a time when Pharaoh had commanded all male 
children born to the Israelites to be thrown into the Nile. Moses' mother kept him 
concealed for three months, and at last, unable to hide him any longer, cast him 
upon the river in an ark of bulrushes, whence he was picked up by Pharaoh's 
daughter (Exodus, 2:1-10).

ordained, O Moses. 41 And I have chosen you for Myself. 

42 Go you and your brother with My messages and do not be 
remiss in remembering Me. 43 Go both of you to Pharaoh, surely 
he is inordinate; 44 then speak to him a gentle word, perhaps he may 
be mindful or fear. 45 They said: Our Lord, we fear that he may 
hasten to do us harm or be inordinate. 46 He said: Do not fear, 
surely I am with you — I do hear and see. 47 So go to him and say: 
Surely we are two messengers of jour Lord, a so send forth the 
Children of Israel with us, and do not torment them. Indeed we 
have brought you a message from jour Lord, and peace be on him 
who follows the guidance. 48 It has indeed been revealed to us that 
punishment will overtake him who rejects and turns away.* 

49 (Pharaoh) said: Who is your Lord, Moses? 50 He said: Our 
Lord is He Who gives to everything its creation, then guides (it). e 
51 He said: What then is the state of the former generations? 52 He 
said: The knowledge of that is with my Lord in a book; my Lord 
neither makes error nor forgets — 53 Who made the earth for you 
an expanse and made for you paths in it and sent down water from 
the clouds. Then with that We bring forth pairs of various herbs. 
54 Eat and pasture your cattle. Surely there are signs in this for those 
who have understanding. 

Section 3: Moses and the Enchanters 

55 From it We created you, and into it We shall return you, 
and from it raise you a second time. 56 And truly We showed him 



a (47) Both Moses and Aaron were messengers (sing, rasul) of God. 

b (48) This contains a clear warning to Pharaoh of his end in case of rejec- 
tion. Moses and Aaron were directed to convey this message. The whole account 
of their actual going to Pharaoh and the delivery of this message is omitted here, 
and the next verse gives us Pharaoh's reply to their demand. 

c (50) This verse contains an argument for the necessity of Divine revelation. 
It says that, as Allah has created everything, and then given it the qualities and 
means by which it can attain to perfection — for this is the true significance of 
hadd, i.e., guides it (to its goal) — so man also stands in need of spiritual and 
moral directions for his attainment to perfection. 



390 20. TA HA • 20 : 57 

all Our signs but he rejected and refused. 57 Said he: Have you 
come to us to turn us out of our land by your enchantment, Moses? 
58 We too can bring to you enchantment like it, so make an appoint- 
ment between us and you, which we do not break, neither we nor 
you, in a central place. 59 (Moses) said: Your appointment is the 
day of the Festival, and let the people be gathered in the early 
forenoon. 

60 So Pharaoh went back and settled his plan, then came. 
61 Moses said to them: Woe to you! Do not fabricate a lie against 
Allah or He will destroy you by punishment, and he fails indeed 
who fabricates (a lie). 62 So they disputed among themselves about 
their affair and kept the talk secret. 63 They said: These are surely 
two enchanters who would drive you out from your land by their 
enchantment, and destroy your excellent institutions. 64 So settle your 
plan, then come (ranged) in ranks, and he will succeed indeed this 
day who is uppermost. 

65 They said: Moses, will you throw, or shall we be the first 
to throw? 66 He said: No, you throw down. Then lo! their cords and 
their rods — it appeared to him by their enchantment as if they 
ran. a 67 So Moses conceived fear in his mind. 68 We said: Do not 
fear, surely you are the uppermost. 69 And throw down what is in 
your right hand — it will eat up what they have produced. What 
they have produced is only the trick of an enchanter, and the 
enchanter does not succeed wherever he comes from. 70 So the en- 
chanters fell down prostrate, saying: We believe in the Lord of 
Aaron and Moses. 

71 (Pharaoh) said: You believe in him before I give you 
permission! Surely he is your chief who taught you enchantment. 
So I shall cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and I 
shall crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and you shall 
certainly know which of us can give the severer and the more 



a (66) The forces of untruth appear to carry the day for a while, but are soon 
vanquished; see v. 69. Also compare 7:1 17, where these cords and rods are des- 
cribed as their lies. 

b (67) Moses feared that people might be misled.

lasting punishment. 72 They said: We cannot prefer you to the clear 
arguments that have come to us and to Him Who made us, so 
decide whatever you will decide. Fou can only decide about this 
world's life. 73 Surely we believe in our Lord that He may forgive 
us our faults and the magic to which you compelled us. And Allah 
is Best and Ever-abiding. 74 Whoever comes guilty to his Lord, for 
him is surely hell. He will neither die in it, nor live." 75 And who- 
ever comes to Him a believer, having done good deeds, for them 
are high ranks — 76 Gardens of perpetuity, in which rivers flow, to 
abide in them. And such is the reward of him who purifies him- 
self. 

Section 4: The Israelites worship the Calf 

77 And certainly We revealed to Moses: Travel by night with 
My servants, then strike for them a dry path in the sea, not fearing 
to be caught, nor being afraid. 78 So Pharaoh followed them with 
his armies, then the sea covered them that would cover them. 
79 And Pharaoh led his people astray and he did not guide aright. 

80 O Children of Israel, We truly delivered you from your 
enemy, and made a covenant with you on the blessed side of the 
mountain, and sent to you the manna and the quails. 81 Eat of the 
good things We have provided for you, and do not exceed the 
limits in that respect, so that My wrath comes upon you; and he on 
whom My wrath comes, he perishes indeed. 82 And surely I am 
Forgiving toward him who repents and believes and does good, 
then walks aright. 

83 And what made you hasten from your people, O Moses? 
84 He said: They are here on my track, and I hastened on to You, my 
Lord, that You might be pleased. 85 He said: Surely We have tried 
your people in your absence, and the Samirl e has led them astray. 



a (74) Those in hell are not alive, because spiritually they are dead, and they 
are not dead because death would mean the cessation of their torments. 

b (77) This shows that there was at that time a dry path in the sea; see 2:50. 

c (85) The verse shows that some person other than Aaron was responsible for 
making the calf. From Rabbinical literature it appears that the Egyptians who had

86 So Moses returned to his people angry, sorrowing. He said: My 
people, did not your Lord promise you a goodly promise? Did the 
promised time, then, seem long to you, or did you wish that dis- 
pleasure from your Lord should come upon you, so that you broke 
(your) promise to me? 87 They said: We did not break the promise 
to you of our own accord, but we were made to bear the burdens 
of the ornaments of the people, then we cast them away, and thus 
did the Samirl suggest." 88 Then he brought forth for them a calf, a 
(lifeless) body, having a lowing sound,* so they said: This is your 
god and the god of Moses; but he forgot. 89 Could they not see that 
it returned no reply to them, e nor controlled any harm or benefit 
for them? 

Section 5: The End of Calf-worship 

90 And Aaron indeed had said to them before: My people, 
you are only tried by it, and surely your Lord is the Beneficent 
God, so follow me and obey my order. 91 They said: We shall not 
cease to keep to its worship until Moses returns to us. 92 (Moses) 
said: Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray, 
93 that you did not follow me? Have you, then, disobeyed my order? 
94 He said: Son of my mother, do not seize me by my beard, nor by 

come with the Israelites were foremost in demanding the making of the calf. 

a (87) The Israelites may have borrowed ornaments from the Egyptians as 
stated in Exodus 12:35, and the reference may here be to those ornaments, or the 
significance may simply be that the nomadic tribes of Israel, who were 
unaccustomed to these things, had imbibed these habits from the Egyptians, and 
now gave up those ornaments at the suggestion of the Samirl. The reply of the 
people states clearly they had not done the thing of their own accord, and hence 
the reference in the concluding words is to the suggestions cast into the minds of 
the people by the Samirl. 

b (88) It had neither a voice nor a soul, but it was only a sound produced by 
the air passing through the hollow metal of which it was made. 

c (89) The argument in this verse shows that God not only listens to prayers 
but also gives a reply to His true worshippers when they pray to Him. 

d (90) From this it is clear that not only had Aaron no part in making the 
calf, but he even enjoined his people to give up its worship. The Quran here con- 
tradicts the Bible.

my head. Surely I was afraid you would say: Fou have caused 
division among the Children of Israel and not waited for my word. 
95 (Moses) said: What was jour object, SamirT? 96 He said: I per- 
ceived what they did not perceive, so I took a handful from the 
footprints of the messenger then I threw it away. Thus did my soul 
entice me." 97 He said: Go away then! It is (the punishment) for you 
in this life to say, Do not touch (me). And surely for you is a pro- 
mise which shall not fail. And look at your god to whose worship 
you have kept. We will certainly burn it, then we will scatter it in 
the sea. 4 98 Your Lord is only Allah, there is no God but He. He 
comprehends all things in (His) knowledge. 

99 Thus We relate to you some news of what has happened 
before. And indeed We have given you a Reminder from Our- 
selves. 100 Whoever turns away from it, he will surely bear a 
burden on the day of Resurrection, 101 abiding in this (state). And 
evil will be their burden on the day of Resurrection — 102 the 
day when the trumpet is blown; and We shall gather the guilty, 
blind, c on that day, 103 consulting together secretly: You stayed 
only ten (days)/ 104 We know best what they say when the fairest 



a (96) The stories which many commentators have related under this verse 
are all baseless. The messenger is evidently Moses himself, and his footprints 
(athar) signify his sunnah, i.e., his practices and sayings, a significance to which 
all authorities agree, the word being well known in Muslim religious literature. 
The taking a handful means a small part of it. The man who made the calf thus 
asserts that he had a clearer perception of things than the Israelites, that he 
accepted the teachings of Moses only partially, and confesses that he now threw 
off even that part and made a calf for worship. 

b (97) This shows that the ashes of the calf were thrown into the sea, and the 
story of the Israelites being made to drink of water mixed with the ashes of the 
calf is not, therefore, credited by the Quran, which here again contradicts the Bible. 
The punishment given to the Samiri is that of an outcast in society, who is prohi- 
bited from having any relations with the Israelite people. 

c (102) The word zurq means blue-eyed, but may signify blind, in reference 
to the guilty being raised up blind in the Resurrection, as in v. 124.

they will have enjoyed ten centuries of great prosperity.

Section 6: The Prophet's Opponents 

105 And they ask you about the mountains. Say: My Lord will 
scatter them, as scattered dust, 106 then leave it a plain, smooth, level, 
107 on which you see no crookedness nor unevenness. 108 On that 
day they will follow the Inviter, in whom is no crookedness; and 
the voices are low before the Beneficent God, so that you hear 
nothing but a soft sound. c 109 On that day no intercession avails 
except of him whom the Beneficent allows, and whose word He is 
pleased with. 110 He knows what is before them and what is behind 
them, while they cannot encompass it in knowledge. ni And faces 
shall be humbled before the Living, the Self-subsistent. And he 
who bears wrongdoing is indeed undone. 112 And whoever does 
good works, and is a believer, has no fear of injustice nor of the 
withholding of what is (his) due. 

113 And thus have We sent it down an Arabic Quran, and 
have distinctly set forth in it some threats that they may guard 
against evil, or that it may be a reminder for them. 114 Supremely 
exalted then is Allah, the King, the Truth. And do not make haste 
with the Quran before its revelation is made complete to you, and 
say: My Lord, increase me in knowledge. 115 And certainly We 



a (104) Because a day is equal to a thousand years; see 22:47. It is the man 
who reminds them of this Divine promise who is called the fairest of them in 
course. 

b (105) The word jabal means a mountain, as well as the lord or chief of a 
people. That the latter significance is intended here is shown by the context; see in 
particular v. 108: "On that day they will follow the Inviter". Verses 106-107 are 
to be taken in the same sense: they point to the removal of all obstacles that 
hindered the advance of Truth. 

c (108) The Inviter in whom there is no crookedness is no other than the 
Holy Prophet, as is clearly stated elsewhere: "Praise be to Allah, Who revealed 
the Book to His servant, and did not allow in it any crookedness" (18:1). The 
whole verse clearly points to a time when Islam would be completely established, 
and instead of opposition the voices would be low before the Beneficent. The low- 
ness of the voice indicates submission.

in him no resolve (to disobey)." 

Section 7: The Devil's Misleading 

116 And when We said to the angels: Be submissive to Adam, 
they submitted, but not IblTs; he refused. 117 We said: O Adam, this 
is an enemy to you and to your wife; so do not let him drive you 
both out of the garden so that you are unhappy. 118 Surely it is 
granted to you that you are not hungry therein, nor naked, 119 and 
that you are not thirsty therein, nor exposed to the sun's heat.* 
120 But the devil made an evil suggestion to him; he said: O Adam, 
shall I lead you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom which does 
not decay? 121 So they both ate of it, then their evil inclinations 
became manifest to them, and they began to cover themselves 
with the leaves of the garden. And Adam disobeyed his Lord, and 
was disappointed. c 



him how the great transformation would be brought about and when the severe 
opposition which he was facing would come to an end. He is here told that he 
should not make haste with regard to what was promised in the Quran. The pro- 
cess will be gradual and meanwhile he should pray for more and more knowledge, 
for it was through knowledge that this great transformation was to be brought 
about. Even today a spiritual transformation can be brought about by spreading 
knowledge of the Quran, which is the greatest spiritual force that the world has ever 
seen, and it is only on account of being ignorant of this great spiritual force that 
the world remains in darkness. 

a (115) This makes it clear that there was no intention on Adam's part to 
disobey God's command, or no resolve to disobey. 

b (119) The garden of which a picture is given here is an earthly garden in 
which all the comforts necessary for man are made available. Allegorically it sig- 
nifies a state of contentment or rest in which there is no yearning either to good or 
to evil, being as it were a state of inertia, devoid of exertion or ambition. 

c (121) While in the picture of the garden drawn above in v. 118-119 mention 
is made of four things, the consequence of getting out of that state is only one: 
their evil inclinations or their shame becoming manifest to them. An explanation 
of this is found in 7:26, where it is said: "O children of Adam, We have indeed 
sent down to you clothing to cover your shame and (clothing) for beauty; and 
clothing that guards against evil — that is the best". Thus it is the clothing that 
guards against evil that is really spoken of here, and by the manifestation of the 
shame is meant the consciousness of having done something evil. The allegorical

122 Then his Lord chose him, so He turned to him and guided 
(him). i 23 He said: Go forth from this (state) both — all (of you) — 
some of you are enemies of others. Surely a guidance from Me 
will come to you; then whoever follows My guidance, he will not 
go astray nor be unhappy. 124 And whoever turns away from My 
Reminder, for him is surely a (spiritually) deprived life, and We 
shall raise him up blind on the day of Resurrection. a 125 He will 
say: My Lord, why have You raised me up blind, while I used to 
see? 126 He will say: Thus did Our messages come to you, but you 
neglected them. And thus are you forsaken this day. 127 And thus 
do We recompense him who is extravagant and does not believe 
in the messages of his Lord. And certainly the punishment of the 
Hereafter is severer and more lasting. 128 Is it not clear to them how 
many of the generations, in whose dwellings they go about, We 
destroyed before them? Surely there are signs in this for those who 
have understanding. 

Section 8: Punishment is Certain 

129 And if a word had not gone forth from your Lord, and a 
term been fixed, it would surely have come upon them. 130 So bear 
patiently what they say, and celebrate the praise of your Lord before 
the rising of the sun and before its setting, and glorify (Him) during 
the hours of the night and parts of the day, that you may be well 
pleased.* 131 And do not strain your eyes (with desire) at what We 

nature of what is so often related as the story of Adam is thus evident. It will be 
further seen that the remedy pointed out is of a spiritual nature, as here in v. 123- 
124 and in 2:38. This shows that the spiritual aspect of man's life and not the 
physical one is the real theme of Adam's story. 

a (124) The person who shuts his eyes to the Reminder leads a spiritually 
deprived life because he does not receive spiritual blessings. It is only a contented 
mind that brings ease and comfort to man, and contentment comes only through 
faith in God. 

b (130) The Holy Prophet, while told to bear persecutions patiently for a time, 
is also told to seek comfort in prayer. And he did find comfort in prayer under the 
severest persecutions. "The coolness of my eyes is in prayer," he is reported to 
have said (Mishkat, 25). This verse speaks of the five obligatory prayers and the 
two optional ones. Before the rising of the sun is the dawn prayer (jqjr), before its 
setting the 'asr prayer. Three prayers, the maghrib, the 'isha ' and the tahajjud 



20:132' PUNISHMENT IS CERTAIN 397 

have provided different classes of them with — the splendour of 
this world's life — that We may try them by means of it. And the 
sustenance of your Lord is better and more lasting. 132 And enjoin 
prayer on jour people, and steadily adhere to it. We do not ask from 
you a sustenance. We provide for you. And the (good) end is for 
guarding against evil. 

133 And they say: Why does he not bring us a sign from his 
Lord? Has not a clear evidence come to them of what is in the 
previous Books? a 134 And if We had destroyed them with punish- 
ment before it, they would have said: Our Lord, why did You not 
send to us a messenger, so that we might have followed Your 
messages before we met disgrace and shame? 135 Say: Everyone 
(of us) is waiting, so wait. Soon you will come to know who is the 
follower of the even path and who goes aright. 



(the last named being optional), occur during the hours of the night, while during 
parts of the day are the zuhr and the duha, the latter again being optional, being a 
short prayer in the early forenoon. 

a (133) The Quran is here called a clear evidence of what is contained in the 
previous Books, because it fulfils their prophecies and corroborates their truth. 



Chapter 21 
Ai-AnMya' The Prophets 

This chapter deals with the deliverance of the prophets, hence its title, and the 
ultimate triumph of their cause. It tells us that judgment on the opponents is 
approaching and the truth must triumph now as always. Then it draws atten- 
tion to the truth of revelation, after which it speaks of God's merciful dealing 
with people as this is how the Holy Prophet's opponents would be dealt with. 
Next, examples of a number of prophets are cited who were delivered from 
their enemies. At the end we are told that the righteous will be made to inherit 
the land. This chapter was revealed in the early period at Makkah, about or 
before the fifth year of the Holy Prophet's mission.

Section 1: Judgment approaches 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Their reckoning draws near to people, and they turn away in 
heedlessness. 2 No new Reminder comes to them from their Lord 
but they hear it while they play, 3 their hearts trifling. And they — 
the wrongdoers — counsel in secret: He is nothing but a mortal 
like yourselves; will you then yield to enchantment while you see? 
4 He said: My Lord knows (every) utterance in the heaven and the 
earth, and He is the Hearer, the Knower. 

5 Indeed, say they: Confused dreams! Rather, he has forged it! 
Rather, he is a poet! so let him bring us a sign such as the former 
(prophets) were sent (with)." 6 Not a town believed before them 



a (5) The Quraish were quite puzzled, and hostile critics of the Quran are 
still puzzled, what they could liken the Quran to. They first call it sihr, i.e., skilful 
eloquence, because, despite their opposition to it, it had an attraction for them. 
But then there are prophecies which mere eloquence cannot produce, so they call 
it confused dreams or medleys of dreams. Then they think that there is a settled 
purpose in it, by reason of its asserting the Prophet' s triumph and the discomfiture 
of his powerful enemies, so they call it an intentional forgery; and lastly, as if to 
devise one word combining all these, they call him a poet. Then they demand a 
sign like one given to the former prophets, meaning their destruction, because the 



398 



21:7" JUDGMENT APPROACHES 399 

which We destroyed: will they then believe?" 7 And We did not 
send before you any but men to whom We sent revelation; so ask 
the followers of the Reminder if you do not know. 8 Nor did We 
give them bodies not eating food, nor did they live forever.* 'Then 
We made Our promise good to them; so We delivered them and 
whom We pleased, and We destroyed the extravagant. 10 Certainly 
We have revealed to you a Book which will give you eminence. 
Do you not then understand? ° 

Section 2: Truth has always Triumphed 

11 And how many a town which was unjust did We demolish, 
and We raised up after it another people! 12 So when they felt Our 
might, lo! they began to flee from it. 13 Do not flee and return to 
the easy lives which you led, and to your dwellings, that you may 
be questioned. 14 They said: O woe to us! Surely we were unjust. 
15 And this cry of theirs did not cease till We made them cut off, 
extinct. 

16 And We did not create the heaven and the earth and all that 
is between them for sport. 17 If We had wished to take a pastime, 
We would have taken it from before Ourselves; by no means 



Quran had repeatedly called their attention to the fate of those who had rejected 
the truth before them. 

a (6) They are told in reply that persistence in wickedness and disbelief has 
always been punished with destruction. 

b (8) Thus every prophet had a mortal body needing food for its support, and 
every one of them tasted of death. Therefore Jesus also must have had a body 
which stood in need of food and must have tasted of death. The idea that he is alive 
is clearly opposed to this verse. 

c (10) Whenever the opponents demand that the threatened punishment should 
come, the reply always is that the Quran is a blessing and a mercy for them. The 
same truth is expressed here. They are told that the Quran has been revealed to 
make them a great and eminent nation in the world. Dhikr means eminence, fame, 
renown, honour as well as reminder. Also see 2:152 footnote. 

d (16) They were made to witness signs of the truth of the Prophet and they 
are now told to bear in mind that these signs were not in vain. In nature every 
cause has an effect and every end is achieved by means. Life must be taken 
seriously, not as a jest. 



400 21. THE PROPHETS - 21 : 18 

would We do (so). 18 Indeed, We hurl the Truth against falsehood, 
so it knocks out its brains, and lo! it vanishes." And woe to you for 
what you describe! 19 And to Him belongs whoever is in the hea- 
vens and the earth. And those who are with Him are not too proud 
to serve Him, nor are they weary. 20 They glorify (Him) night and 
day — they do not tire. 

21 Or have they taken gods from the earth who give life? 
22 If there were in them gods besides Allah, they would both have 
been in disorder. So glory be to Allah, the Lord of the Throne, 
being above what they describe! 23 He cannot be questioned as to 
what He does, and they will be questioned. 24 0r, have they taken 
gods besides Him? Say: Bring your proof. This is the reminder of 
those with me and the reminder of those before me.' But most of 
them do not know the Truth, so they turn away. 25 And We sent no 
messenger before you but We revealed to him that there is no God 
but Me, so serve Me. 



26 And they say: The Beneficent has taken to Himself a son. 
Glory be to Him! No, they are honoured servants — 27 They do 
not speak before He speaks, and according to His command 



a (18) Mark the deep conviction of the Prophet as to the ultimate triumph of 
Truth in the world. Truth had dawned on his mind in full resplendence. The forces 
of darkness and falsehood, which were uppermost in Arabia when these words 
were uttered, were brought to naught in his lifetime and, however powerful they 
may appear to be, they cannot even today make a stand before the onward march 
of Truth. 

b (22) There is order in the universe because one law pervades the whole of 
it, and one law clearly points to one Author and Maintainer of that law. Note that 
here Allah is spoken of as Rabb al- 'Arsh, the nourisher to perfection or Lord of 
the Throne, so that the Throne itself is sustained by God, and it is not God Who is 
sustained by the Throne. 

c (24) The great and fundamental truth of the Unity of Allah is common to 
all religions; no prophet ever taught polytheism. 

d (26) Refuting the doctrine that Jesus is the son of God, it is added that they 
are honoured servants. The words draw attention to the fact that others besides 
Jesus were spoken of as the sons of God, but that the title signified nothing more 
than that they were honoured servants, and that therefore Jesus was the son of 
God exactly in the same sense. 



21:28' TRUTH OF REVELATION 401 

they act." 28 He knows what is before them and what is behind 
them, and they do not intercede except for him whom He approves, 
and for fear of Him they tremble. 29 And whoever of them should 
say, I am a god besides Him, such a one We recompense with hell. 
Thus We reward the unjust. 

Section 3: Truth of Revelation 

30 Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the 
earth were closed up, so We split them apart. And We made from 
water everything living. Will they not then believe? 31 And We 
made firm mountains in the earth in case it should quake with 
them, and We made in it wide ways that they might follow a right 
direction. 32 And We have made the heaven a guarded canopy; 



a (27) This verse affords a conclusive testimony for the sinlessness of pro- 
phets. In the first place they do not speak till Allah has spoken, i.e., they speak 
according to what He has taught them, not speaking of their own accord. And 
secondly, when they act, they act according to His commandment. Thus both their 
words and deeds are in accordance with Divine will, and therefore sin or dis- 
obedience of God cannot be attributed to them. The context shows clearly that the 
verse speaks of prophets, and not of angels. 

b (30-1) The heavens and the earth may stand here for the whole universe, or 
for the solar system in particular, which has developed out of a nebular mass, and 
the separation may refer to the starry creation or to the throwing off of the planets 
of the solar system, and the great symmetry of its arrangement and the motions of 
the various bodies. There is a reference to the orbits of the various planets further 
on in v. 33. But there may also be a deeper allusion in the closing up of the 
heavens and the earth to the cessation of Divine revelation for a time before the 
advent of the Holy Prophet, which was marked by the absence of a prophet in the 
world for six hundred years and the prevalence of corruption all over the world. 
The opening up of the heavens and the earth would in this case signify the coming 
of revelation, which brought life to the world. In physical nature too, rain opens 
up the earth. 

c (30-2) While this statement reveals a remarkable truth in the physical world, 
a truth which science has established only recently, that water is the source of all 
life, it draws attention to the equally remarkable spiritual truth that it is only by 
Divine revelation, which is again and again compared with water in the Quran, 
that life is given to a world otherwise dead in sin and corruption. 

rf(31) See 16:15 and footnote. The first part of the verse may also be transla- 
ted as We made firm mountains in the earth that they might be a source of benefit

yet they turn away from its signs." 33 And He it is Who created the 
night and the day and the sun and the moon. All float in orbits. 

34 And We did not grant living forever to any mortal before 
you. If you die, will they live forever? 35 Every soul must taste of 
death. And We test you by evil and good by way of trial. And to 
Us you are returned.* 36 And when those who disbelieve see you, 
they treat you only with mockery: Is this he who speaks of your 
gods? And they deny when the Beneficent God is mentioned/ 
37 Man is created of haste. Soon will I show you My signs, so ask 
Me not to hasten them. 38 And they say: When will this promise 
come to pass, if you are truthful? 6 39 If those who disbelieve only 
knew the time when they will not be able to ward off the fire from 
their faces, nor from their backs, and they will not be helped! 
40 Indeed, it will come to them all of a sudden and stun them, so 
they will not have the power to avert it, nor will they be given 
respite. 41 And messengers before you were indeed mocked, but that 
which they mocked at befell those of them who scoffed. 

to you. Compare 79:32-33. In the latter part there may be a deeper reference to 
the ways pointed out by prophets among every nation. 

a (32) Arabia had its spiritualists, astrologers and diviners who pretended to 
have access to the secrets of heaven; see 67:5. They are told that they cannot have 
any such access. Or, the meaning is that revelation from God (called here heaven) 
is guarded against all attacks. 

b (35) They were afflicted with small evils, and the removal of these again 
brought to them a turn of good events. All this was by way of trial; the greater 
punishment, which was to bring about the final overthrow of their power, was yet 
in store for them. 

c (36) The Arabs would not call Allah by the name al-Rahman (see also 
17:110 and 25:60); hence the Beneficent God is here spoken of in contrast with 
the idols. 

d (37) So prominent is the characteristic of haste in man that he may be said 
to have been created, as it were, of haste. 

e (38) The particular sign which they again and again demanded was that a 
destructive punishment like that which overtook former people should overtake 
them. 

/(41) The rejectors of truth have always scoffed at the idea of being punish- 
ed. This and the two preceding verses assert in the most forcible words that Truth 
will finally triumph. 



21 : 42 • ALLAH DEALS WITH PEOPLE MERCIFULLY 403 

Section 4: Allah deals with People Mercifully 

42 Say: Who guards you by night and by day from the Bene- 
ficent?" But they turn away at the mention of their Lord. 43 0r, 
have they gods who can defend them against Us? They cannot 
help themselves, nor can they be defended from Us. 44 Indeed, We 
gave provision to these and their fathers, until life was prolonged 
to them. Do they not see then that We are visiting the land, 
curtailing it of its sides? Can they then prevail? 

45 Say: I warn you only by revelation; and the deaf do not 
hear the call when they are warned. 46 And if a blast of the 
punishment of your Lord were to touch them, they would say: 
O woe to us! Surely we were unjust. 47 And We will set up a just 
balance on the day of Resurrection, so no soul will be wronged in 
the least. And if there were the weight of a grain of mustard seed, 
We will bring it. And Sufficient are We to take account. 

48 And certainly We gave Moses and Aaron the criterion and 
a light and a reminder for those who guard against evil, 49 who 
fear their Lord in secret and they are fearful of the Hour. 50 And 
this is a blessed Reminder, which We have revealed. Will you then 
deny it? 

Section 5: Abraham is delivered 

51 And certainly We gave Abraham his rectitude before, and 
We knew him well. 52 When he said to his sire and his people: 
What are these images to whose worship you are devoted? 53 They 
said: We found our fathers worshipping them. 54 He said: Certainly 
you have been, you and your fathers, in manifest error. 55 They 
said: Have you brought us the truth, or are you a jester? 56 He said: 



a (42) That is, if Allah were not Beneficent to you and guarded you, there is 
none who could guard you. Or if He, despite His beneficence, were to punish you 
because of your persistence in evil to such a degree as to call for the wrath of even 
a Beneficent Master, there would be none to guard you against that punishment. 

b (48) The criterion given to Moses was that he was delivered from the 
hands of a most powerful enemy. The last verse of the section predicts that a 
similar sign would be shown in the case of the Prophet Muhammad. 



404 21. THE PROPHETS • 21 : 57 

Indeed, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who 
created them; and I am one of the bearers of witness to this. 
57 And, by Allah! I will certainly plan against your idols after you 
go away, turning your backs. 

58 So he broke them into pieces, except the chief of them, that 
perhaps they might return to it." 59 They said: Who has done this 
to our gods? Surely he is one of the wrongdoers. 60 (Some) said: 
We heard a youth, who is called Abraham, speak of them. 61 They 
said: Then bring him before the people's eyes, perhaps they may 
bear witness. 62 They said: Have you done this to our gods, Abra- 
ham? 63 He said: Surely (someone) has done it. The chief of them 
is this; so ask them, if they can speak. 64 Then they turned to 
themselves and said: Surely you yourselves are wrongdoers; 
65 then they were made to hang down their heads: c You know indeed 
that they do not speak. 66 He said: Do you then serve besides Allah 
what does you no good, nor harms you? 67 Enough of you and what 
you serve besides Allah! Have you no sense? 

68 They said: Burn him, and help your gods, if you are going 
to do (anything). 69 We said: O fire, be coolness and peace for 



a (58) The story of Abraham's breaking the idols is related in Jewish Rabbi- 
nical literature. 

b (63) These words do not mean "No, he has done it, this chief of them". 
There is a pause after the words "has done it" and the statement "the chief of them 
is this" is an independent statement. Thus the first words mean some doer has 
done it. The particle bal occurring before these words often denotes and or surely. 
The idols were taken as gods yet they were not able to help themselves. They 
were shattered to pieces, yet they could do no harm to their shatterer. Nor could 
they even tell their votaries who was responsible for this. It should be further 
noted that Abraham never tried to conceal what he had done. In fact, before brea- 
king the idols he had warned the people that he would plan against their idols; see 
v. 57. The object of sparing the chief idol was, as made clear in v. 58, that 
perhaps they might return to it. The chief was yet safe, they should have argued 
within themselves, why not pray to him to find out who broke the others. This is 
hinted at in v. 64, where they are made to confess their own wrongdoing in wor- 
shipping things which could do them no good or harm (v. 66). 

c (65) They were made to hang down their heads on account of shame, for 
their deities proved so helpless as to be unable to name even the person who did 
them injury. 



21 : 70 • ALLAH ALWAYS DELIVERS PROPHETS 405 

Abraham:" 70 And they intended a plan against him, but We made 
them the greater losers. 71 And We delivered him and Lot (direct- 
ing them) to the land which We had blessed for the nations. 72 And 
We gave him Isaac; and Jacob, a son's son. And We made (them) 
all good. 73 And We made them leaders who guided (people) by 
Our command, and We revealed to them the doing of good and 
the keeping up of prayer and the giving of charity, and Us (alone) 
they served; 74 and to Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge, and 
We delivered him from the town which committed wicked deeds. 
Surely they were an evil people, transgressors; 75 and We admitted 
him to Our mercy; surely he was from among the righteous. 

Section 6: Allah always delivers Prophets 

76 And Noah, when he cried before (this), so We answered 
him, and delivered him and his people from the great calamity. 
77 And We helped him against the people who rejected Our mess- 
ages. Surely they were an evil people, so We drowned them all. 

78 And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment con- 
cerning the field, when the people's sheep strayed into it by night, 
and We were bearers of witness to their judgment. 79 So We made 
Solomon to understand it. And to each (of them) We gave wisdom 
and knowledge. And We made the mountains, declaring (Our) glory, 
and the birds, subservient to David.* And We were the Doers. 



a (69) The fire was turned into coolness and peace for Abraham. The Quran 
does not state anywhere that Abraham was actually cast into a fire. His opponents 
had no doubt decided to burn him, as stated here, or to kill him or burn him 
(29:24). But here in v. 70 as well as in 37:98, we are told in clear words that they 
intended a plan against him, but We made them the greater losers (v. 70), or We 
brought them low (37:98). This shows that their plan was ineffective. According 
to 29:24, Allah delivered him from the fire, before being thrown into or after 
being thrown into it, it does not say. V. 71 states that the delivery was brought 
about by means of a journey to another land. It was thus a flight to another place 
like the Holy Prophet's Flight to Madinah, and in the history of Abraham there is 
a deeper reference to the history of the Prophet himself. 

b (79) Elsewhere it is stated that everything that exists in the heavens or the 
earth is made subservient to man (45:13); and on various occasions it is mentioned 
that the rivers, the sea, the sun and the moon, night and day, etc., are made 



406 21. THE PROPHETS "21:80 

80 And We taught him the making of coats of mail for you, to 
protect you in your wars; will you then be grateful? 

81 And to Solomon (We subdued) the wind blowing violent, 
pursuing its course by His command to the land which We had 
blessed, and We are ever Knower of all things. " 82 And of the 
devils there were those who dived for him and did other work 
besides that, and We kept guard over them; 83 and Job, when he 
cried to his Lord: Distress has afflicted me, and You are the most 
Merciful of those who show mercy! 84 So We responded to him 
and removed the distress he had, and We gave him (back) his 
people and more like them with them, a mercy from Us and a 
reminder to the worshippers. c 

85 And Ishmael and Idrls and Dhu-1-Kifl; all were from 

subservient to man (16:12, 16:14, 13:2, etc.). This explains the meaning of 
making mountains and birds subservient to David. A thing is said to be made 
subservient to a man when he can use it to his advantage. Note further that every- 
thing in the heavens and the earth declares the glory of Allah (17:44). But see 
34:10, where a similar statement occurs and may refer to the conquests of David. 

a (81) Solomon's fleet did him an important service, and this is what is 
meant by the wind being made subservient to Solomon. Also compare 14:32: 
"And He has made the ships subservient to you, to run their course in the sea by 
His command". 

b (82) Elsewhere we have: "And the devils, every builder and diver, and 
others fettered in chains" (38:37-38). Solomon employed foreigners, whom he 
had subdued, to do the work of divers and builders. The word shaitan (or devil) 
signifies one who is excessively proud, rebellious or audacious. See further 38:38. 

c (84) Job is again mentioned after Solomon in greater detail in 38:41^44. 
There also he is spoken of as being given his people (ahl) and more like them with 
them. There, however, we have clear indications that the distress spoken of here 
relates to some journey which he undertook in connection with his mission. As a 
result of this journey he lost, or was separated from, his people. It seems that he 
had to flee to some place of safety, and he ultimately found not only his own 
people but others like them, i.e., he had other believers in him in his place of 
refuge. The story of Job as given in the Quran is really a prophetical statement 
relating to the Prophet's own Flight from Makkah to Madinah, where he met with 
not only his Makkan followers but also believers in Madinah in about the same 
number. 

d (85) The commentators differ in identifying Dhu4-Kifl with one of the 
Biblical prophets, Zacharias, Elias, or Joshua. A more sound suggestion is that he

surely they were from among the good ones. 87 And Dhu-1-Nun, a

constrain him, e so he called out among afflictions: d There is no 
God but You, glory be to You! Surely I am a sufferer of loss. 6

do We deliver the believers. 89 And Zacharias, when he cried to his

is Ezekiel. This prophet is mentioned only once again, as here without any 
reference to his history, in 38:48. {Editor's Note: Dhu-l-Kifl may stand for Dhu-l- 
Kipl, as the letter/) is represented by /in Arabic, there being no p in the Arabic 
alphabet. Dhu-l-Kipl would mean he who belongs to Kapila, this being the name 
of the town in ancient India to which Buddha belonged. According to the clear 
teachings of the Quran, prophets and messengers of God were sent to every nation: 
'And there is not a people but a warner has gone among them" — 35:24; see also 
10:47, 4:164 and 40:78. Buddha's life and teachings, and his great following, lead 
us to infer that he was a messenger of God in Quranic terms.) 

a (87-1) Dhu-1-Nun is another name for Jonah, the Arabic equivalent of the 
latter being Yunus, by which name the prophet is mentioned in 6:86, 10:98 and 
37:139. Nun means a big fish, and Dhu-l-Nun therefore means lord of the fish. In 
a very early revelation, Jonah is spoken of as the companion of the fish (68:48). 
Both these titles seem to be taken from the incident of the fish; see 37:142. 

b (87-2) Evidently what is meant is that he was angry with his people and 
left them for another place. A prophet's being angry with God is simply unimagi- 
nable. Moreover he is spoken of here as going away, while no man could think of 
going away from the presence of the Omnipresent. He was wroth with his people 
because of their stubbornness. See also 37:140. 

c (87-3) Finding his people stubborn, he went away from them and was 
wroth with them and thought, or rather knew (zanna), that some way would be 
opened for him to bring people to guidance somewhere. These words may also 
mean: he thought We would not decree against him. 

d (87-4) Literally, darkness. Difficulty is compared to darkness because of 
the inability of a person to find his way when in difficulty, as when in darkness. 

e (87-5) The word zulm may mean anything from the slightest falling off 
from one's duty to the greatest transgression. It is used sometimes in a good sense 
when a man imposes upon himself a heavy duty to please God. Jonah is here 
spoken of as being of the zalimin (one of the sufferers of loss) in the sense of 
making himself suffer a loss by going away from his original place, or of having 
failed in doing justice to the message with which he was entrusted.

of inheritors! 90 So We responded to him and gave him John and 
made his wife fit for him. ' Surely they used to hasten in (doing) 
good deeds and called upon Us, hoping and fearing; and they were 
humble before Us. 91 And she who guarded her chastity/ so We 
breathed into her of Our inspiration, and made her and her son a 
sign for the nations. 92 Surely this your community is a single 
community, and I am your Lord, so serve Me. 93 And they split 
apart their unity: to Us will all return. 

Section 7: The Righteous will inherit the Land 

94 So whoever does good deeds and is a believer, there is no 
rejection of his effort, and We surely write (it) down for him.

return. 6 96 Even when Gog and Magog are let loose and they sally

near, then the eyes of those who disbelieve will be fixedly open: 
O woe to us! Surely we were heedless of this; indeed, we 



a (89) That is, One Who will remain after all have perished. 

b (90) By fitness is meant fitness to bear a child, because she was thought to 
be barren. 

c (91) Mary, the mother of Jesus, is meant here. Nothing is said about 
immaculate conception here. The guarding of chastity does not preclude the law- 
ful union of husband and wife. 

d (92) The basic principle of all religions taught by the prophets has been 
one and the same in all ages and all countries, that Allah is the Lord of all and He 
alone must be served. Therefore all prophets are here declared to be one comm- 
unity; they all led people to virtue through service to God. But, as the next verse 
shows, their followers broke off this unity. 

e (95) The verse reveals the great truth that those who are made to taste of 
death are not sent back into this world. 

/(96-1) The previous verse contains a prohibition against the return to life of 
those who are dead, or the rise of nations that are once destroyed. This one points 
out that even Gog and Magog, despite their predominance in the whole world, 
will follow the same law. The word hatta can mean even as well as until. 

g (96-2) For Gog and Magog, see 18:94 and footnote. The words they sally 
forth from every elevated place mean that they will take possession of every point 
of vantage and convenience, so as to dominate the whole world. See further 18:98 
and footnote.

were unjust." 98 Surely you and what you worship besides Allah 
are fuel of hell; to it you will come. "If these had been gods, 
they would not have come to it. And all will abide in it. i°°For 
them therein is groaning and in it they do not hear. e 

101 Those for whom the good (end) has already gone forth from 
Us, they will be kept far off from it — 102 They will not hear the 
faintest sound of it and they will abide in that which their souls 
desire. 6 103 The great Terror will not grieve them, and the angels 
will meet them: This is your day which you were promised. 104 The 
day when We roll up heaven like the rolling up of the scroll of 
writings. As We began the first creation, We shall reproduce it. 
A promise (binding) on Us. We shall bring it about/ 



a (97) The True Promise that draws near with the domination of Gog and 
Magog is the promise of the ultimate triumph of Truth: "He it is Who has sent His 
Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth that He may make it prevail 
over all religions" (9:33). This is also referred to in 18:99, after speaking of the 
great conflict of Gog and Magog, in the words then We shall gather them all to- 
gether. Thus the time when Gog and Magog overcome the whole world is also the 
time when Truth will gain ground and prevail over the whole earth. Materialism 
would first spread over the whole world, but would prove a failure. Then would 
spiritual Truth shine and people would feel that they had not only been heedless to 
it, but even unjust in trying to suppress it. 

b (98) Compare 18:100: "And We shall bring forth hell, exposed to view, on 
that day before the disbelievers". 

c (100) Those who turn a deaf ear to the Truth here shall be raised deaf in the 
life after death, and therefore they do not hear. 

d (101) This verse totally refutes the false idea that even the righteous will 
first go to hell. They will not even hear its faintest sound, as the next verse states. 

e (102) It is the bliss of communion with God which the souls of the righteous 
long for, so it is that bliss in which they shall live in the Hereafter. 

/(104) The rolling up of the heaven like a written scroll means that the old 
order will be swept away altogether, just as when a writing is finished, it is rolled 
up. This no doubt happened in Arabia at the appearance of the Holy Prophet. But 
then follows the statement: As We began the first creation, We shall reproduce it. 
The sweeping away of the old order no doubt meant that a new order would be 
created. This is the first creation referred to here — the bringing about of a new 
order at the Prophet's appearance. And then we are told that the new order will be 
reproduced again. This reproduction is in reference to what has been earlier stated 
— that Gog and Magog will dominate the whole world. The spiritual resuscitation 



410 21. THE PROPHETS '21:105 

105 And certainly We wrote in the Book after the reminder 
that My righteous servants will inherit the land." 106 Surely in this 
is a message for a people who serve (Us). 107 And We have not 
sentyou but as a mercy to the nations. 108 Say: It is only revealed 
to me that your God is one God: will you then submit? 109 But if 
they turn back, say: I have warned you in fairness, and I do not 
know whether what you are promised is near or far. 110 Surely He 
knows what is spoken openly and He knows what you hide. 
ni And I do not know if this may be a trial for you and a provision 
till a time. 112 He said: My Lord, judge with truth. And our Lord is 
the Beneficent, Whose help is sought against what you ascribe (to 
Him). 



to which Islam gave rise would thus receive a set-back by the predominance of a 
material outlook of the world through the prevalence of Gog and Magog, but this 
set-back, we are here told, would be only temporary, and a spiritual awakening 
like the first spiritual awakening would then be brought about in the whole world. 
This statement is followed by the words: A Promise binding on Us. The promise 
of the ultimate triumph of Truth in the whole world is of frequent occurrence in 
the Quran in earlier as well as in later revelation, and the temporary set-back indi- 
cated here is also frequently mentioned, and on one occasion at least it is made 
fully clear that it will be a set-back extending over a thousand years (32:5). 

a (105) The Quran had repeatedly warned the disbelievers that Islam would 
be made triumphant in the land, and the righteous servants who were made to suffer 
persecution would one day be masters of the land. But as already noted, it is of the 
whole world that the Quran is speaking and we are here told that Truth will ulti- 
mately triumph in the whole world, which would thus be inherited by the righteous. 
This is made clear in v. 107. 

b (107) While the words no doubt contain a reference to the merciful dealing 
with the Prophet's opponents, the real significance is that the Prophet's advent 
will prove a mercy not only to the Arabs by making them a foremost nation in the 
world, but to the whole of humanity. The Prophet's being a mercy to the nations 
of the world, is to show that ultimately all nations will be received into the Divine 
mercy which was manifested through him. Already the teachings of the Quran 
have not only benefited its followers, but even those who still reject its message, 
for, despite their rejection of it, they have accepted many of its principles. 



Chapter 22 
Ai-Hajj The Pilgrimage 

This chapter is called The Pilgrimage because the proclamation of pilgrimage, 
originally made by Abraham, was now repeated by the Holy Prophet and 
addressed to the whole world. It opens with the prophecy of a terrible calamity, 
which is a preliminary to the triumph of truth. Then it asserts the certainty of 
Divine help for the believers and their consequent triumph. As their triumph 
would involve the conquest of Makkah, the chapter then deals with the topics 
of the Sacred House, the pilgrimage and sacrifice. The subject of fighting is 
then introduced, requiring sacrifices to be made. Then it tells us that, despite 
opposition, the faithful would be established in the land, but as Allah's deal- 
ing with the opponents is merciful their punishment would be withheld for a 
while. At the end it declares that polytheism would be uprooted. This chapter 
was revealed in the late period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : The Judgment 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O people, keep your duty to your Lord; surely the shock of 
the Hour is a grievous thing." 2 The day you see it, every woman 
giving suck will forget her suckling and every pregnant one will 
lay down her burden, and you will see people as drunken, yet they 
will not be drunken, but the punishment of Allah will be severe. 
3 And some people dispute about Allah without knowledge, and 
follow every rebellious devil — 4 For him it is written that who- 
ever takes him for a friend, he will lead him astray and conduct 
him to the punishment of the burning Fire. 



a (1) In the Quran, al-sa 'ah or the Hour does not necessarily imply the day 
of Judgment. It often implies the time of judgment in this life, the time when the 
threatened doom overtakes a people, and this seems to be the significance here. 
Some consider that a severe shaking of the earth is meant as a sign of the approach 
of the great judgment, but even in that case it might imply any terrible calamity, 
such as a great war. 

b (3) The devil here is, as frequently in the Quran, the devil in human form.

412 22. THE PILGRIMAGE • 22 : 5 

5 O people, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then 
surely We created you from dust, then from a small life-germ, then 
from a clot, then from a lump of flesh, complete in make and 
incomplete, that We may make clear to you. e And We cause what 
We please to remain in the wombs till an appointed time, then We 
bring you forth as babies, then that you may attain your maturity. 
And some of you are caused to die, while some of you are brought 
back to the worst part of life, knowing nothing after having know- 
ledge. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down 
water upon it, it stirs and swells and brings forth a beautiful (growth) 
of every kind. 6 6 That is because Allah, He is the Truth, and He 
gives life to the dead, and He is Powerful over all things, 7 and the 
Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it; and Allah will raise up 
those who are in the graves. 

8 And some people dispute about Allah without knowledge, 



a (5-1) The word ba 'th (raising, or as "resurrection" here) is used in three 
senses in the Quran: (1) the raising of the dead to life according to their good or 
evil deeds on the Judgment day; (2) the raising of the spiritually dead to life by 
the prophets; and (3) the raising up of prophets by Allah for the guidance of man- 
kind. The word as used here may include the denial of all these three cases. The 
argument contained in this and the following verses is equally applicable to all, 
but it most prominently refers to the spiritual resurrection of the dead. 

b (5-2) These words explain the meaning of Adam's or man's creation from 
dust, which is frequently referred to in the Quran, for all people are here spoken 
of as being created from dust. Man's creation from dust implies the ultimate 
springing of all life from earth. 

c (5-3) The various stages through which every human child passes are 
spoken of here, showing how humble is his origin. Or, the reference may be to the 
various stages through which man has passed in his evolution to the present stage 
of perfection. Attention is thus drawn to the fact that, just as the physical evolu- 
tion of man is gradual, so is his spiritual growth and development. 

d (5-4) By the worst part of life is meant dotage and decrepitude. 

e (5-5) The stirring and swelling of the earth means its stirring and swelling 
with the growth of herbage. Compare 41:39. The illustration draws attention to the 
fact that revelation quickens dead hearts as rain quickens dead earth. 

/(7) Compare 35:22: "Surely Allah makes whom He pleases hear, and you 
cannot make those hear who are in the graves". The significance is that even the 
incorrigible will be raised to a spiritual life. 



22 : 9 • CERTAINTY OF DIVINE HELP 413 

and without guidance, and without an illuminating Book, 9 (such a 
person) turning away haughtily to lead (others) astray from the 
way of Allah. For him is disgrace in this world, and on the day of 
Resurrection We shall make him taste the punishment of burning. 
10 This is for what jour two hands have sent ahead, and Allah is 
not in the least unjust to the servants. 

Section 2: Certainty of Divine Help 

11 And some people serve Allah, (standing) on the verge," so 
if good befalls such a one he is satisfied with it, but if a trial afflicts 
him he turns back headlong. He loses this world and the Hereafter. 
That is a manifest loss. 12 He calls besides Allah on something 
which cannot harm him, nor benefit him; that is straying far. 13 He 
calls on him whose harm is nearer than his benefit. Certainly an 
evil guardian and an evil associate! 

14 Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good 
deeds enter Gardens in which rivers flow. Allah indeed does what 
He pleases. 15 Whoever thinks that Allah will not assist him in this 
life and the Hereafter, let him raise (himself) by some means to 
the heaven, then let him cut (it) off, then let him see if his plan 
will take away what he is enraged at.* 16 And thus have We 
revealed it, clear arguments, and Allah guides whom He will. 
17 Those who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabians and 
the Christians and the Magians and those who set up partners 
(with Allah) — surely Allah will decide between them on the day 



a (11) This expression indicates the attitude of a man who wavers, being ready 
to quit the faith on any pretence. 

b (15) The prophecies of the final triumph of the Truth and of the coming of 
Divine assistance to the Holy Prophet were repeatedly declared in the Quran, and 
the disbelievers were enraged at this. They are told that the Divine assistance must 
come, and that they should leave no stone unturned in their struggle against it, 
insomuch that, if they could, they should rise to heaven and cut off all heavenly or 
Divine assistance from the Prophet. Or, the meaning may be that they may carry 
their anger to the greatest possible extreme and be driven to the utmost desperation, 
yet they will be unable to stop the coming of Divine help to the Prophet. 



414 22. THE PILGRIMAGE • 22 : 18 

of Resurrection. Surely Allah is Witness over all things." 

18 Do you not see that to Allah makes submission whoever is 
in the heavens and whoever is in the earth, and the sun and the moon 
and the stars, and the mountains and the trees, and the animals and 
many of the people? And many there are to whom punishment is 
due. And he whom Allah disgraces, none can give him honour. 
Surely Allah does what He pleases. 

19 These are two adversaries who dispute about their Lord. 
So those who disbelieve, for them are cut out garments of fire. 
Boiling water will be poured out over their heads. 20 With it will be 
melted what is in their bellies and (their) skins as well. 21 And for 
them are whips of iron. 22 Whenever they desire to go out from it, 
from grief, they are turned back into it, and (it is said): Taste the 
punishment of burning. 

Section 3: Believers are Triumphant 

23 Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good deeds 
enter Gardens in which rivers flow — they are adorned therein 
with bracelets of gold and (with) pearls. And their garments 
therein are of silk. e 24 And they are guided to pure words, and they 
are guided to the path of the Praised One. 25 Those who disbelieve 
and hinder (people) from Allah's way and from the Sacred Mosque, 



a (17) It is implied that differences in religious beliefs do not call for punish- 
ment in this life; these will be decided on the day of Judgment. Punishment in this 
life is brought upon those who work mischief and transgress all limits in doing 
evil. 

b (22) Min ghamm-in ("from grief") explains min-ha ("from it"), and thus 
explains the nature of the punishment in this and the previous verse. It is a grief 
which will constantly burn their souls so as to melt them. 

c (23) The following incident, mentioned by Baihaqi, shows that the compa- 
nions of the Prophet understood these prophecies in another sense too: "The 
bracelets of Kisra, the Persian monarch, were brought to Umar, and he made 
Suraqa ibn Malik to wear them, on which he praised the Almighty". The reason 
for Umar making Suraqa wear the bracelets is also given by the same authority in 
another report, according to which the Holy Prophet had said to Suraqa: "How 
will you feel when you wear the bracelets of Kisra?" 



22:26- PILGRIMAGE 415 

which We have made equally for all people, (for) the dweller in 
it and the visitor." And whoever inclines to wrong in it, unjustly, 
We shall make him taste of painful punishment. 

Section 4: Pilgrimage 

26 And when We pointed to Abraham the place of the House, 
saying: Do not set up any partner with Me, and purify My House 
for those who make circuits and stand to pray and bow and pros- 
trate themselves. 27 And proclaim to mankind the Pilgrimage: 6 they 
will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, coming from 
every remote path, c 28 that they may witness benefits (provided) for 
them, and mention the name of Allah on appointed days over the 
cattle quadrupeds that He has given them; then eat of them and 
feed the distressed one, the needy. 29 Then let them accomplish 
their needful acts of cleansing, and let them fulfil their vows and 
go round the Ancient House. 2 



a (25) The two may respectively signify the dweller in Makkah and the 
dweller in the desert, or one who dwells in it constantly and one who comes to it 
occasionally. The disbelievers, being then in possession of the Sacred Mosque, 
prevented Muslims from using it. They are told that this state of things will be 
brought to an end, for it must be open to all visitors, and that could only be 
brought about by Muslims being made masters of it. 

b (27-1) The words are addressed to the Holy Prophet, and contain a mighty 
prophecy that Makkah will become the centre to which people will come for pil- 
grimage. It was announced just at the time when the Holy Prophet was being 
driven away from Makkah by his enemies. Just when Makkah seemed to have lost 
every chance of becoming a Muslim centre, and when Muslims themselves were 
in danger of being entirely destroyed, a mighty prophecy is announced in the most 
forcible words that Islam will spread to all countries of the world, and Makkah 
will become the universal centre to which pilgrims from all nations will come. 

c (27-2) The lean camel is particularly mentioned here to indicate the great 
distances from which pilgrims would come. The addition of the words from every 
remote path shows that people will come from the remotest parts of the earth. 

d (28) The subject of sacrifice is one that is specially related to the pilgri- 
mage, because every pilgrim must sacrifice an animal. Thus it is the lesson of 
sacrifice that is taught in pilgrimage. The act of the pilgrim finds an echo through- 
out the Muslim world, for every Muslim who can afford is required to sacrifice an 
animal on this occasion, and this subject is discussed in the next section. 

e (29) The mention of the Ka'bah as the Ancient House, here and in v. 33,

30 That (shall be so). And whoever respects the sacred ordi- 
nances of Allah, it is good for him with his Lord. And the cattle 
are made lawful for you, except what is recited to you, so shun the 
filth of the idols and shun false words, 31 being upright for Allah, 
not setting up partners with Him. And whoever sets up partners 
with Allah, it is as if he had fallen from on high, then the birds had 
snatched him away, or the wind had carried him off to a distant 
place. 32 That (shall be so). And whoever respects the ordinances 
of Allah, this is surely from the piety of hearts. 33 In them are bene- 
fits for you for a term appointed, then their place of sacrifice is the 
Ancient House. 

Section 5: Sacrifices 

34 And for every nation We appointed acts of devotion that 
they might mention the name of Allah on the cattle quadrupeds that 
He has given them. So your God is One God, therefore to Him 
should you submit." And give good news to the humble, 35 whose 
hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned, and who are patient in 
their afflictions, and who keep up prayer, and spend (on good 
works) out of what We have given them. 6 



shows that it is so old that it came to be known throughout Arabia by that name, 
thus pointing to its very remote antiquity; see 2:125. 

a (34) The principle of sacrifice is one which is accepted in one form or 
another by all nations of the world; but it has a deeper meaning in Islam. The out- 
ward act is still there but it no more conveys the meaning attached to it in ancient 
religions, viz., that of appeasing an offended Deity, or that of serving as an atone- 
ment for sins. It signifies the sacrifice of the sacrificer himself, and becomes thus 
an outward symbol of his readiness to lay down his life, if required, and to sacrifice 
all his interests and desires in the cause of Truth. Hence it is that words intro- 
ducing the subject of sacrifice are immediately followed by an injunction to submit 
oneself entirely to Allah, Who is the one God, i.e., the only Being Who deserves 
to be made the true object of one's love. 

b (35) It is by the mention of Allah's name that an animal is sacrificed, and 
the meaning underlying it is that their own hearts should tremble at the mention of 
that name. Thus they should bear in mind, when sacrificing an animal over which 
they hold control, how much more necessary it is that they should lay down their 
lives in the way of Allah, Who holds control over all. Hence a verse speaking of 
sacrifices is immediately followed by one which requires the exercise of great 
patience and endurance under hard trials by the faithful. 



22:36- PILGRIMAGE 417 

36 And the camels, We have made them from among the signs 
appointed by Allah for you " — in them there is much good for you. 
So mention the name of Allah on them standing in a row. Then 
when they fall down on their sides, eat of them and feed the con- 
tented one and the beggar. Thus have We made them subservient 
to you that you may be grateful. 37 Not their flesh, nor their blood, 
reaches Allah, but to Him is acceptable the observance of duty on 
your part. c Thus has He made them subservient to you, that you 
may magnify Allah for guiding you aright. And give good news to 
those who do good (to others). 38 Surely Allah defends those who 
believe. Surely Allah does not love anyone who is unfaithful, 
ungrateful. 

Section 6: Believers permitted to fight 

39 Permission (to fight) is given to those on whom war is made, 
because they are oppressed. And surely Allah is Able to assist 
them 6 — 40 Those who are driven from their homes without a just 



a (36-1) The camels which are brought for sacrifice to Makkah by the pil- 
grims are here stated to be only outward signs of the true religion of Allah, that 
religion being no other than the religion of entire submission to Allah and of lay- 
ing down all one has, even one's life, in the way of Allah. 

b (36-2) The flesh of the animals sacrificed is not to be wasted, but it should 
serve as food for the poor and the needy. 

c (37) It is not the outward act of sacrifice which is acceptable, but the deep 
meaning of sacrifice which underlies it. The idea of atonement is quite foreign to 
Islamic sacrifice. It is the righteous whom Islam requires to sacrifice, as hinted at 
in the words: to Him is acceptable the observance of duty on your part. 

d (38) A new subject is now introduced, the subject of fighting in the way of 
Allah. This sheds light upon the connection which exists between the two sub- 
jects. After dealing with the subject of sacrifice theoretically, the Muslim has in 
fact been prepared to bring into practice the theory of the sacrifice. Hence he is 
told that the time is near when he will be required to lay down his very life in the 
defence of Truth, which the opponents were striving to exterminate. Therefore, 
the subject of fighting in the cause of Truth is a fitting sequel to the subject of 
sacrifice, as casting further light upon the inner meaning of sacrifice, and also 
requiring that doctrine to be carried into practice. 

e (39) This is the earliest permission given to the Muslims to fight. The 
words in which the permission is granted show clearly that war was first made on

cause except that they say: Our Lord is Allah. And if Allah did not 
repel some people by others, surely cloisters and churches and syna- 
gogues, and mosques in which Allah's name is much remembered, 
would have been pulled down. And surely Allah will help him 
who helps Him. Surely Allah is Strong, Mighty." 41 Those who, if 
We establish them in the land, will keep up prayer and give the 
due charity and enjoin good and forbid evil. And Allah's is the 
end of (all) affairs. 

42 And if they reject you, already before them did the people 
of Noah and Ad and Thamud reject (prophets), 43 and the people of 
Abraham and the people of Lot, 44 and the dwellers of Midian. And 
Moses (too) was rejected. But I gave respite to the disbelievers, 
then I seized them; so how (severe) was My disapproval! 45 How 
many a town We destroyed while it was unjust, so it is fallen 
down upon its roofs; and (how many) a deserted well and palace 
raised high! 46 Have they not travelled in the land so that they 
should have hearts with which to understand, or ears with which 
to hear? For surely it is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are 
the hearts which are in the breasts.* 47 And they ask you to hasten 
on the punishment, and Allah by no means fails in His promise. 
And surely a day with your Lord is like a thousand years as you 

the Muslims by their opponents; and secondly, that the Muslims had already 
suffered great oppression at the hands of their persecutors. The words of the next 
verse, those who are driven from their homes, may refer to the emigration to 
Abyssinia, or to the exodus to Madinah, which commenced soon afterwards. 

a (40) The religious freedom established by Islam has not yet been surpassed 
by the most civilized and tolerant of nations. It deserves to be noted that the lives 
of Muslims are to be sacrificed not only to stop their own persecution by their 
opponents and to save their own mosques, but to save churches, synagogues and 
cloisters as well — in fact, to establish perfect religious freedom. Mosques, though 
they are the places where the name of Allah is remembered most of all, are 
mentioned after churches and synagogues. Early Muslims closely followed these 
directions, and every commander of an army had express orders to respect all 
houses of worship, and even the cloisters of monks, along with their inmates. 

b (46) The Quran very often speaks of the blind, the deaf and the dead, 
meaning thereby the spiritually blind, deaf and dead, as it has plainly stated here.

was unjust, then I seized it! And to Me is the return. 

Section 7: Opposition to the Prophet 

49 Say: O people, I am only a plain warner to you. 50 So those 
who believe and do good, for them is forgiveness and an honour- 
able sustenance. 51 And those who strive to oppose Our messages, 
they are the inmates of the flaming Fire. 

52 And We never sent a messenger or a prophet before you 
but when he desired, the devil made a suggestion in regard to his 
desire; but Allah annuls what the devil casts, then does Allah estab- 
lish His messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise — 53 that He 
may make what the devil casts a trial for those in whose hearts is a 
disease and the hard-hearted. c And surely the wrongdoers are in 
severe opposition, 54 and that those who have been given know- 
ledge may know that it is the Truth from your Lord, so they should 
believe in it that their hearts may be lowly before Him. And surely 
Allah is the Guide of those who believe, into a right path. 

55 And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt 
concerning it, until the Hour overtakes them suddenly, or the 



a (47) Those spoken of here are undoubtedly the opponents of Truth who were 
to come later, and who have been allowed to oppose the advance of Islam for a 
thousand years. The set-back which Islam was to receive for a thousand years is 
again spoken of in 32:5. 

b (52) A false story is mentioned in connection with this verse, according to 
which the Holy Prophet on one occasion recognized that the idols worshipped by 
the Arabs could intercede with God on their behalf. See 53:21 footnote. This story 
has been rejected by all sound and reliable commentators. The words of this verse 
do not, and cannot, mean that when a prophet recites a revelation, the devil intro- 
duces his own words into his recitation. What every prophet desires is the estab- 
lishing of the Truth that is revealed to him, and it is with this desire of every 
prophet that the devil interferes, instigating people, making suggestions to them, 
as stated here, to oppose the Truth. That this is the true meaning is also shown by 
the context, which deals with the establishing of the Truth and the desire of the 
opponents of Truth to annihilate it. 

c (53) The devil's strivings against the Prophet become a trial for the weak, 
who are unable to endure the severe persecutions of their enemies.

punishment of a destructive day comes to them. 56 The kingdom on 
that day is Allah's. He will judge between them. So those who 
believe and do good will be in Gardens of bliss. 57 And those who 
disbelieve and reject Our messages, for them is a humiliating 
punishment. 

Section 8: The Faithful shall be established 

58 And those who flee in Allah's way and are then slain or die, 
Allah will certainly grant them a goodly sustenance." And surely 
Allah is the Best of providers. 59 He will certainly make them enter 
a place which they are pleased with. And surely Allah is Knowing, 
Forbearing. 60 That (is so). And whoever retaliates with the like of 
what he is afflicted with, and he is oppressed, Allah will certainly 
help him. Surely Allah is Pardoning, Forgiving. 61 That is because 
Allah makes the night to pass into the day and makes the day to 
pass into the night, and because Allah is Hearing, Seeing/ 62 That 
is because Allah is the Truth, and what they call upon besides Him 
— that is the falsehood, and because Allah — He is the High, the 
Great. 

63 Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the 
cloud, then the earth becomes green? Surely Allah is Knower of 



a (58) A flight of the faithful to Abyssinia had already taken place, and on 
the occasion of the flight to Madinah the Holy Prophet, with Abu Bakr and Ali, 
were the last men to depart from Makkah. A true and generous leader of men, he 
waited to see his faithful followers depart before he left, so that their safety might 
be ensured. If he had left his followers behind him, they would have encountered a 
very hard fate at the hands of an exasperated enemy. The reference to some being 
slain after their flight is clearly prophetical. 

b (60) This verse permits Muslims, who were long persecuted and oppressed, 
to punish their persecutors, but at the same time recommends pardon and forgive- 
ness by referring to those two attributes of the Divine Being in the concluding 
words of the verse. 

c (61) Apparently the succession of the day and the night refers here to the 
turn of fortune hinted at in the previous verse, because an oppressed community 
could not punish its persecutors unless it gained mastery over them. The same is 
indicated in the two attributes of the Divine Being with which the verse is closed. 
The verses that follow contain hints to the same effect.

subtleties, Aware. 64 To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens 
and whatever is in the earth. And surely Allah — He is the Self- 
Sufficient, the Praised. 

Section 9: Divine Mercy in dealing with People 

65 Do you not see that Allah has made subservient to you all 
that is in the earth, and the ships gliding in the sea by His 
command? And He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth 
except with His permission. Surely Allah is Compassionate, Merci- 
ful to mankind." 66 And He it is Who brings you to life, then He 
causes you to die, then He will bring you to life. Surely man is 
ungrateful. 

67 To every nation We appointed acts of devotion, which they 
observe,* so do not let them dispute with you in the matter, and 
call (them) to jour Lord. Surely you are on a right guidance. 68 And 
if they argue with you, say: Allah best knows what you do. 69 Allah 
will judge between you on the day of Resurrection in that in which 
you differ. 70 Do you not know that Allah knows what is in the 
heaven and the earth? Surely this is in a book. That is surely easy 
to Allah. 

71 And they serve besides Allah that for which He has not 
sent any authority, and of which they have no knowledge. And for 
the unjust there is no helper. 72 And when Our clear messages are 
recited to them, you will notice a denial on the faces of those who 
disbelieve — they almost attack those who recite to them Our 
messages. Say: Shall I inform you of what is worse than this? The 
Fire. Allah has promised it to those who disbelieve. And evil is the 
destination. 



a (65) The first part of the verse gives a promise of victory to the Muslims, 
while the latter part warns the opponents that Allah withholds the punishment from 
them for a time, for He is Compassionate and Merciful to people. The withholding 
of the heaven means the withholding of the punishment, which the opponents were 
told would come down upon them from heaven. 

b (67) The principle that all nations were given spiritual light is reiterated 
throughout the Quran.

Section 10: Polytheism will be uprooted 

73 O people, a parable is set forth, so listen to it. Surely those 
whom you call upon besides Allah cannot create a fly, though they 
should all gather for it. And if the fly carry off anything from them, 
they cannot take it back from it. Weak are (both) the invoker and 
the invoked." 74 They do not estimate Allah with His due estima- 
tion. Surely Allah is Strong, Mighty. 75 AUah chooses messengers 
from angels and from mankind. Surely Allah is Hearing, Seeing. 
76 He knows what is before them and what is behind them. And to 
Allah are all affairs returned. 

77 O you who believe, bow down and prostrate yourselves and 
serve your Lord, and do good that you may succeed. 78 And strive 
hard for Allah with due striving. He has chosen you and has not 
laid upon you any hardship in religion — the faith of your father 
Abraham. He named you Muslims before and in this,* that the 
Messenger may be a bearer of witness to you, and you may be 
bearers of witness to the people; c so keep up prayer and give the 
due charity and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protector; excellent 
the Protector and excellent the Helper! 



a (73) The verse, while truly describing the inability of false gods to create the 
lowest form of life or to exercise the least control over creation, contains a clear 
prophecy that the false deities will be removed from the Sacred House, and that 
both the worshippers and the worshipped will be helpless. 

b (78-1) The reference in before is to the revelation of Abraham, who prayed 
that from among his descendants there should arise a nation of Muslims (2:128), 
and in this to the Quran. The root- word of Islam and Muslim is salm or silm, both 
signifying peace, and a Muslim is therefore one who leads a life of peace, peace 
with God, which means complete submission to His will, and peace with man, 
which means that he causes no injury to any person, as a saying of the Holy 
Prophet has it (Bukhari, 2:3). 

c (78-2) Compare 2:143, where similar words are used. The significance is 
that the Muslim community is destined to play the role of leader to the whole of 
humanity. 



Chapter 23 
Ai-Mu'minun The Belie vers 

This chapter is so named because it deals with the success of the Believers. 
Continuing the subject-matter of the last chapter, it first asserts the success of 
the believers and then refers to similar success in case of the former prophets, 
whose history, it tells us, will be repeated in the Holy Prophet's case. It ends 
with a condemnation of polytheism by its own votaries and shows how the 
wicked will finally regret their evil deeds. This chapter was revealed in the 
late period at Makkah. 



!"! 



Section 1: Success of the Faithful 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

2? 1 Successful indeed are the believers, 2 who are humble in their 

prayers, 3 and who shun what is vain, 4 and who act for the sake of 
purity, a 5 and who restrain their sexual passions — 6 except in the 
presence of their spouses or those whom their right hands possess, 
for such surely are not to be blamed, e 7 but whoever seeks to go 



a (4) The words li-l-zakat mean for the sake of purity or to attain purity . The 
word zakat means originally purity, as in 19:13, while zakat in the sense of due 
charity is spoken of as being paid or given. 

b (5) This expression, lit. guard their private parts, means the restraining of 
sexual passions. 

c (6) The words ma malakat aimanu-hum, literally "those whom their right 
hands possess", usually indicate slaves. It should be noted that this chapter was 
revealed at Makkah, and the conditions under which slave-girls could be taken as 
wives were given later at Madinah; see 4:25. If the reference here is to sexual rela- 
tions, the permission regarding those whom their right hands possess must be read 
subject to the conditions of 4:25. It may, however, be added that the expression 
used in v. 5 means in a wider sense the covering of parts of the body which it is 
indecent to expose, and in this connection it must be borne in mind that, according 
to Islamic rules of decency, the exposure of such parts of the body, as are 
generally exposed at evening entertainment venues, is disallowed, but a certain 
degree of freedom is allowed to women in the presence of their husbands and 
female servants and to men in the presence of their wives and male servants.

beyond that, these are the transgressors — 8 and those who are 
faithful to their trusts and their covenant, 9 and those who keep a 
guard on their prayers. 10 These are the heirs, n who inherit Para- 
dise. In it they will abide. 

12 And certainly We create man of an extract of clay , a 13 then 
We make him a small life-germ in a firm resting-place, 14 then We 
make the life-germ a clot, then We make the clot a lump of flesh, 
then We make (in) the lump of flesh bones, then We clothe the 
bones with flesh, then We cause it to grow into another creation. 
So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators! 15 Then after that you 
certainly die. 16 Then on the day of Resurrection you will surely be 
raised up. 

17 And indeed We have made above you seven ways — and 
never are We heedless of creation. c 18 And We send down water 
from the cloud according to a measure, then We cause it to settle 
in the earth, and We are indeed Able to carry it away. 19 Then with 
it We cause to grow gardens of palm-trees and grapes for you. 
You have therein many fruits, of which you eat; 20 and a tree that

a (12) The creation of man is here traced back to earth, for the life-germ in 
sperma is an extract of food, which is drawn from earth in whatever form it may 
be. While the first eleven verses speak of the spiritual growth of man, his physical 
growth is here spoken of, and thus a comparison may be established between the 
physical and the spiritual growth. Though described in the past tense, it is a gene- 
ral law of the creation of man that is spoken of here. The addition of the words, 
then We cause it to grow into another creation (v. 14), is to show that man's 
creation does not end with the completion of the different stages of physical 
growth, as in the case of other animals, but he is endowed with certain other 
faculties — the reference being to the moral and spiritual side of man's growth. 

b (14) The several stages in the growth of the human child, as given here, 
and unknown then, are quite in accordance with scientific investigation. It should 
be borne in mind that the word fa, meaning then, as used in then We clothe the 
bones... does not always imply order. This is clear from the context, which states 
that there is first a lump of flesh, and the nucleus of the bones is generated in this 
flesh. 

c (17) Instead of the seven heavens, here we have the seven ways, which may 
be the orbits of the seven members of the solar system, excluding the earth, as 
shown by the words above you.

make you to drink of what is in their bellies, and you have in them 
many advantages and of them you eat, 22 and on them and on the 
ships you are borne. 

Section 2: Noah 

23 And certainly We sent Noah to his people, so he said: My 
people, serve Allah, you have no God other than Him. Will you 
not guard against evil? 24 But the chiefs of those who disbelieved 
from among his people said: He is only a mortal like you, who 
desires to have superiority over you. And if Allah had pleased, He 
could have sent down angels. We have not heard of this among 
our forefathers. 25 He is only a madman, so bear with him for a 
time. 

26 He said: My Lord, help me against their calling me a liar. 
27 So We revealed to him: Make the ark under Our eyes and 
according to Our revelation; then when Our command comes, and 
water gushes forth from the valley, take into it two of all things, a 
pair,* and your own people, except those among them against 
whom the word has gone forth, and do not speak to Me in respect 
of those who are unjust; surely they will be drowned. 28 Then when 
you are firmly seated, you and those with you, in the ark, say: 
Praise be to Allah, Who delivered us from the unjust people! 
29 And say: My Lord, cause me to land a blessed landing and You 
are the Best of those who bring to land. 

30 Surely there are signs in this, and surely We are ever trying 
(people). 31 Then We raised after them another generation. 32 So 
We sent among them a messenger from among them, saying: 
Serve Allah — you have no God other than Him. Will you not 
guard against evil? 



a (20) In the tree that grows out of Mount Sinai, and which produces oil, 
there seems to be reference to the blessed olive tree of 24:35, as representing the 
Muslim nation.

Section 3: Prophets after Noah 

33 And the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and called 
the meeting of the Hereafter a lie, and whom We had given plenty 
to enjoy in this world's life, said: He is only a mortal like you, eat- 
ing what you eat and drinking what you drink." 34 And if you obey 
a mortal like yourselves, then surely you are losers. 35 Does he 
promise you that, when you are dead and become dust and bones, 
you will then be brought forth? 36 Far, very far, is what you are 
promised: 37 There is nothing but our life in this world, we die and 
we live and we shall not be raised again; 38 he is only a man who 
has forged a lie about Allah, and we are not going to believe in 
him. 

39 He said: My Lord, help me against their calling me a liar. 
40 He said: In a little while they will certainly be repenting. 41 So 
the punishment overtook them in justice, and We made them as 
rubbish; so away with the unjust people! 

42 Then We raised after them other generations. 43 No people 
can hasten on their doom, nor postpone it. 44 Then We sent Our 
messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came to a 
people, they called him a liar, so We made them follow one 
another and We made them stories. So away with a people who do 
not believe! 

45 Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our 
messages and a clear authority 46 to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but 
they behaved haughtily and they were an insolent people. 47 So they 



a (33) The prophets are rejected because they are subject to the same laws of 
nature in their human requirements as other people. And no one can be a model 
for humans, who is not himself a human being, and who is not subject to the same 
laws of nature, for only a human being can show people how they can avoid fall- 
ing a prey to the frailties of human nature. Hence, a Divine incarnation, or God in 
a human body, cannot serve as a model to human beings. We want a mortal to show 
us how to avoid the pitfalls with which we, as mortals, are surrounded; if God 
Himself comes into the world, He cannot serve this purpose. 

b (44) The significance of making them stories is that the stories of their evil 
fate were the only remembrance of them left when they perished. 



23 : 48 • HIGHER VALUES OF LIFE 427 

said: Shall we believe in two mortals like ourselves while their 
people serve us? 48 So they rejected them and became of those who 
were destroyed. 49 And certainly We gave Moses the Book that 
they might go aright. 50 And We made the son of Mary and his 
mother a sign, and We gave them refuge on a lofty ground having 
meadows and springs." 

Section 4: Higher Values of Life 

51 O messengers, eat of the good things and do good. Surely I 
am Knower of what you do. 52 And surely this your community is 
one community, and I am your Lord, so keep your duty to Me. 
53 But they split apart their unity into sects, each faction rejoicing 
in what it had. 54 So leave them in their ignorance till a time. 55 Do 
they think that by the wealth and children with which We aid them, 
56 we are hastening to them good things? Rather, they do not 
perceive. 

57 Surely they who live in awe for fear of their Lord, 58 and 
those who believe in the messages of their Lord, 59 and those who 
set up no partner with their Lord, 60 and those who give what they 
give while their hearts are full of fear that to their Lord they must 
return — 61 These hasten to good things and they are foremost in 
attaining them. 



a (50) This description of the land applies exactly to the valley of Kashmir, 
and part of the lost ten tribes of Israel is traced to Kashmir, where a large number 
of places bear the names of places in Palestine. There is also a tomb known as the 
tomb of Nabi (i.e., the prophet), or 'Isa (i.e., Jesus), or a man by the name of Yilz 
Asaf, in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir. The fact that the chapter deals with the 
final triumph of prophets and their deliverance from the hands of their enemies also 
gives us a clue to the mystery attending the circumstances of the disappearance of 
Jesus after the event of the Cross; for, as shown in 4:157 footnote, Jesus did not 
die on the cross. This verse indicates that, being delivered from the hands of his 
enemies, he was given shelter at some other place which, from its description here 
and other evidence, seems to be Kashmir. Traditions about Yuz Asaf lead us to 
identify him with Jesus, and to conclude that Jesus went to Kashmir after the event 
of the crucifixion, and that he preached, lived, died and was buried there. 
(Editor's Note: Since this footnote was written, much research has been published 
supporting this theory. For details, Khwaja Nazir Ahmad's work, Jesus in Heaven 
on Earth, first published in 1952, as well as a number of later publications, some 
of them by Western authors, should be consulted.)

62 And We do not impose on any soul a duty beyond its 
ability, and with Us is a book which speaks the truth, and they are 
not wronged. 63 But their hearts are in ignorance about it, and they 
have besides this other deeds which they do. 64 Until, when We 
seize those who lead easy lives among them with punishment, 
then they cry for help. 65 Do not cry for help this day. Surely you 
will not be helped by Us. 66 My messages were indeed recited to 
you, but you used to turn back on your heels 67 haughtily, passing 
nights in talking nonsense about it. 68 Do they not then ponder the 
Word? Or has there come to them something which did not come 
to their fathers of old? 69 0r do they not recognize their Messenger, 
that they deny him? 70 Or say they: There is madness in him? But 
he has brought them the Truth, and most of them hate the Truth. 
71 And if the Truth follow their desires, the heavens and the earth 
and all those who are in them would perish. Indeed, We have 
brought them their reminder, but they turn away from their 
reminder. 72 0r do you ask them a recompense? But the recom- 
pense of your Lord is best, and He is the Best of providers. 73 And 
surely you call them to a right way. 

74 And surely those who do not believe in the Hereafter are 
deviating from the way. 75 And if We show mercy to them and 
remove the distress they have, they would persist in their inordinacy, 
blindly wandering on. 76 And already We seized them with punish- 
ment, but they were not submissive to their Lord, nor did they 
humble themselves." 77 Until, when We open for them a door of 
severe punishment, then they are in despair at it.

a (76) The punishment referred to in this verse, and the distress, the removal 
of which is mentioned in the previous verse, probably refer to the famine which 
overtook the people of Makkah. 

b (77) They do not take a warning from the milder punishment, so a severer 
punishment must follow. This overtook them in the form of battles, leading to 
their ultimate defeat. But the promise relates to the future as well.

Who gives life and causes death, and His is the alternation of the

like of what the ancients said. 82 They say: When we die and be- 
come dust and bones, shall we then be raised up? 83 We are indeed 
promised this, and (so were) our fathers before. This is nothing 
but stories of the ancients! 

84 Say: Whose is the earth, and whoever is in it, if you know? 
85 They will say: Allah's. Say: Will you not then be mindful? 
86 Say: Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the 

87 

mighty Throne of power? They will say: (This is) Allah's. Say: 
Will you not then guard against evil? 88 Say: Who is it in Whose 
hand is the kingdom of all things and He protects, and none is 
protected against Him, if you know? 89 They will say: (This is) 
Allah's. Say: From what are you then deceived? '"Indeed, We 
have brought them the Truth and surely they are liars. 91 AUah has 
not taken to Himself a son, nor is there with Him any (other) god 
— in that case would each god have taken away what he created, 
and some of them would have overpowered others. Glory be to 
Allah above what they describe — 92 The Knower of the unseen 
and the seen; so may He be exalted above what they set up as 
partners (with Him)! 

Section 6: Regrets of the Wicked 

93 Say: My Lord, if You show me what they are promised — 
94 My Lord, then do not place me with the unjust people. 95 And 
surely We are well Able to show you what We promise them." 
96 Repel evil with what is best. We know better what they describe. 



a (95) The promise given to the Holy Prophet in these verses is that the 
power of his persecutors will be broken in his lifetime. 

b (96) The doing of good in return for evil is the common teaching of all 
prophets. But nowhere is the principle put in such a beautiful and practical form 
as in the Quran. To return good for evil is only possible under certain circum- 
stances, and the Gospel doctrine — that ye resist not evil — has not been found 
practicable. The Quran, however, says, repel evil with what is best. If you can 
repel an evil by doing good for it, it is the course recommended; but if punishment

97 And say: My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the evil sugges- 
tions of the devils," 98 and I seek refuge in You, my Lord, should 
they come to me. "Until when death catches up with one of them, 
he says: My Lord, send me back, 100 that I may do good in that 
which I have left. By no means! It is only a word that he speaks. 
And before them is a barrier, until the day they are raised. c 

101 So when the trumpet is blown, there will be no ties of 
relationship among them that day, nor will they ask of one another. 
102 Then those whose good deeds are heavy, those are the successful. 
103 And those whose good deeds are light, those are they who have 
lost their souls, abiding in hell. 104 The Fire will scorch their faces, 
and in it they will be in severe affliction. 105 Were not My messages 
recited to you, but you used to reject them? 106 They will say: Our 
Lord, our misfortune overcame us, and we were a people in error. 
107 Our Lord, take us out of it; then if we return (to evil), we shall 
be unjust. 108 He will say: Go away into it, and do not speak to Me. 
109 Surely there was a group of My servants who said: Our Lord, 
we believe, so forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are the 
Best of those who show mercy. 110 But you ridiculed them, until 



is necessary, that would be the better course. It is the only workable principle of 
life. 

a (97) The evil suggestions of the devils were really suggestions of the 
wicked, who were opposed to the progress of Islam, and the Prophet is here told 
to look upon Allah as his only support. To seek refuge in the Lord is the height of 
goodness. Nowhere has a man a better refuge than in the Source of all strength, 
and no mortal can aspire to a higher honour than having his refuge in the Lord. 
The command to the Prophet to say this is really an image of the aspiration of his 
soul. His soul rested in that highest degree of security from all evil suggestions, 
which is termed refuge in the Lord. 

b (99) These words make it quite certain that the devils of the two previous 
verses are no other than the wicked opponents of the Holy Prophet. 

c (100) That the dead do not return to life is a principle which is reaffirmed 
here; see also 21:95. According to the Quran there are three states of a man's life, 
viz., his life in this world, his life in barzakh (referred to as "barrier" here) and the 
great manifestation of all spiritual realities that will take place on the day of 
Resurrection. Barzakh is the intermediate state in which the soul lives after death 
till the Resurrection. Here it is stated that no one who has passed into the state of 
barzakh is allowed to go back into the previous state. See further 39:42.

of the Throne of Grace. 117 And whoever invokes, besides Allah, 
another god — he has no proof of this — his reckoning is only 
with his Lord. Surely the disbelievers will not be successful. 
118 And say: My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and You are the 
Best of those who show mercy. 



a (110) It was not really the believers who caused them to forget the 
remembrance of their Lord but, on account of their mocking the believers, the dis- 
believers forgot their Lord; hence the believers are here spoken of as though they 
caused the disbelievers to forget their Lord. 

b (115) This verse establishes the doctrine of the responsibility of human 
actions. Man is not created in vain, but he will be returned to his Lord to meet the 
consequences of what he does in this life. 



Chapter 24 
Ai-Nar The Light 

In verse 35 of this chapter Islam is shown to be the most perfect manifesta- 
tion of Divine Light to illumine both East and West, and hence the name of 
the chapter. As this light was to first illumine the houses in which Muslims 
live (v. 36), this chapter deals with the purity of home life. It begins by 
condemning illicit sexual relations and slander against women, and then it 
prescribes measures to prevent sexual immorality. It goes on to deal with the 
kindling of Divine light in Muslim hearts and the establishment of the king- 
dom of Islam. It ends by teaching respect for each other's privacy and for the 
Holy Prophet's orders as these relate to the welfare of the community. This 
chapter was revealed at Madinah, largely about 5 A.H. 



Section 1 : Law relating to Adultery 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 (This is) a chapter We have revealed and made obligatory 
and in which We have revealed clear messages that you may be 
mindful. 2 The adulteress and the adulterer, flog each of them (with) 
a hundred strokes," and do not let pity for them detain you from 



a (2) Chastity, as a virtue, is not given the first place in modern civilized 
society. The breach of the greatest trust which can be imposed in a man or a 
woman, the breach which ruins families, destroys household peace, and deprives 
innocent children of their loving mothers, is not looked upon even as seriously as 
the breach of trust of a small sum of money. Hence the Islamic law seems to be 
too severe to the West. 

The punishment for adultery is here stated to be flogging, not stoning to 
death, which was really prescribed by the Jewish law. The cases of stoning to 
death for adultery by the Prophet's orders relate actually to a Jew and a Jewess in 
one case (Bukhari, 23:61), and others apparently occurred before the revelation of 
this chapter. That stoning to death was never contemplated by Islam as a punish- 
ment for adultery is made clear by 4:25, where it is stated expressly that the 
punishment for adultery in the case of slave-girls, when they are married, is half 
the punishment which is inflicted on free married women, and stoning to death 
could not be halved. Besides, the Quran nowhere speaks of stoning as a punish-

obedience to Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day, and 
let a group of believers witness their punishment. 3 The adulterer 
cannot have sexual relations with any but an adulteress or an 
idolatress, and the adulteress, none can have sexual relations with 
her but an adulterer or an idolater; and it is forbidden to believers." 

4 And those who accuse free women and do not bring four 
witnesses, flog them (with) eighty strokes and never accept their 
evidence, and these are the transgressors — 5 except those who 
afterwards repent and act aright; surely Allah is Forgiving, 
Merciful. 

6 And those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses 
except themselves, c let one of them testify four times, bearing Allah 
to witness, that he speaks the truth, 7 and the fifth time (he shall 
swear) that the curse of Allah be on him, if he is lying. 8 And it 
shall avert the punishment from her, if she testify four times, 
bearing Allah to witness, that he is lying, 9 and the fifth time (she 
shall swear) that the wrath of Allah be on her, if he speaks the 
truth. 10 And if it were not for Allah's grace upon you and His 
mercy — and that Allah is Oft-returning (to mercy) Wise! 



ment for adultery. Flogging was aimed more at disgracing the culprit than at 
torturing him. In the time of the Prophet, and even for some time after him, there 
was no whip, and flogging was carried out by beating with a stick or with the hand 
or with shoes. The culprit was not stripped naked, but he was required to take off 
thick clothes. 

a (3) The idolater or the idolatress is mentioned along with the adulterer or 
the adulteress on account of the low standard of morality among the idolaters. 

b (4) This is an effectual restraint against slander and gossip, which so often 
bring disaster upon the heads of innocent women. Unless there is the clearest evi- 
dence of adultery against a woman, the slanderer is himself to be punished. 

c (6) The ordinance relates to the case of husbands who accuse their wives of 
adultery and have no evidence (see a case in Bukhari, 68:30). In such a case 
divorce is effected, the husband not being punishable for the accusation, though 
he cannot produce witnesses, and the wife not being punishable for adultery, if she 
denies the charge in the manner stated. The same procedure would be adopted in a 
reverse case. 

d (9) Editor 's Note: In this procedure, the testimony of the husband and of 
the wife are treated as of equal value and weight.

Section 2: Slanderers of Aishah 

11 Surely they who concocted the lie are a group from among 
you. a Do not consider it an evil to you; rather, it is good for you. 
For every one of them is the sin he has earned; and as for him 
among them who took upon himself the main part of it, he shall 
have a grievous punishment. 12 Why did not the believing men and 
the believing women, when you heard it, think well of their own 
people, and say: This is an evident falsehood? c 13 Why did they 
not bring four witnesses of it? So, as they have not brought 
witnesses, they are liars in the sight of Allah. d 14 And if it were not 
for Allah's grace upon you and His mercy in this world and the 
Hereafter, a grievous punishment would certainly have touched you 
for the talk you indulged in. 



a (11-1) The incident referred to here took place when the Prophet, accom- 
panied by his wife Aishah, was returning from an expedition in 5 A.H. Aishah 
had gone out on a private occasion, but, when she returned, she realized that she 
had lost her necklace, and went back to search for it. In her absence the attend- 
ants, supposing her to be in her howdah, started while it was yet dark. When she 
returned, finding the camel and the men gone, she sat down there and was brought 
to Madinah by a man who was in the rear of the party. Some mischievous persons 
from among the hypocrites spread false reports, slandering her, and some of the 
Muslims also associated themselves with the slander. Aishah's innocence was at 
length established by this revelation (Bukhari, 52:15). Those who had taken part in 
the accusation were punished, according to one hadith (Ibn Maja, 20:13). 

It may be added here that the tongue of gossip has never spared even the most 
virtuous women. Another case of a virtuous woman being thus defamed is that of 
Mary, the mother of lesus, about whom the Jews talked similar slander. The words 
— do not consider it an evil to you; rather, it is good for you — aim to bring 
solace to such aggrieved people. 

b (11-2) He who took the main part of it upon himself is said to be Abdullah 
ibn Ubayy, the chief of the hypocrites (Bukhari, 64:36), because he concocted the 
lie and circulated the false report. 

c (12) There was not a single witness, nor any circumstance that could lend 
colour to the false story. 

d (13) While the Quran takes a very serious view of crimes against chastity, it 
also makes criminal the circulation of false reports affecting a woman's chastity. 
Thus even a lighter accusation in connection with the misconduct of women 
required the evidence of four witnesses; see 4:15. 



24 : 15 • SLANDERERS OF WOMEN 435 

15 When you received it on your tongues and spoke with your 
mouths what you had no knowledge of, and you considered it 
trivial, while with Allah it was serious. l6 And why did you not, 
when you heard it, say: It is not worthy of us to talk of it. Glory be 
to You! This is a great slander. 17 Allah instructs you never to 
return to anything like it again, if you are believers. 18 And Allah 
makes clear to you the messages; and Allah is Knowing, Wise. 
19 Those who love that scandal should circulate with regard to 
those who believe, for them is a grievous punishment in this world 
and the Hereafter. And Allah knows, while you do not know.

Section 3: Slanderers of Women 

21 O you who believe, do not follow the footsteps of the devil. 
And whoever follows the footsteps of the devil, surely he commands 
indecency and evil. And if it were not for Allah's grace on you 
and His mercy, not one of you would ever have been pure, but 
Allah purifies whom He pleases. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 
22 And the possessors of grace and abundance among you should 
not swear against giving to the near of kin and the poor and those 
who have fled in Allah's way; and pardon and overlook. Do you 
not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Forgiving, 
Merciful. c 



a (20) The same words in the next verse are followed by the statement, not 
one of you would ever have been pure. 

b (21) This passage shows that the companions of the Holy Prophet were 
purified from sins by Allah's grace. 

c (22) This verse was revealed in connection with the action of Abu Bakr, 
Aishah's father, who had sworn not to allow maintenance to one of his relatives 
named Mistah, who had taken part in spreading the false reports against Aishah. 
After inflicting the legal punishment on the culprits the Prophet was required to 
bear them no ill-will and to hide no rancour in his heart even towards the slanderers 
of his wife. Revelation even required his companions to be kind and forgiving to 
them. Abu Bakr is spoken of here as one possessing grace and abundance 
(Bukhari, 65.24:13), the former of these words referring to his moral and spiritual 
superiority and the latter to abundance in wealth. {Editor's Note: Upon hearing

(of the evil), are cursed in this world and the Hereafter, and for

they did, 25 on that day Allah will pay back to them in full their

given to you; and if it is said to you, Go back, then go back; this is 
purer for you. And Allah is Knower of what you do. 29 It is no sin 



this revelation, Abu Bakr exclaimed: "I certainly love that Allah should forgive me", 
and then he resumed providing assistance to Mistah. This verse shows also that it 
is entirely baseless and false to assert that Islam prescribes the death penalty for 
those who commit "blasphemy" against its sacred personalities.) 

a (23) This refers to those who continue to spread evil reports concerning 
chaste women, the gossip-mongers in every society. 

b (24) The evidence of the members of the body is sometimes witnessed in 
this very life against the doers of evil, in the consequences of the evil done. On 
the day of Resurrection the consequences of the evil deeds will assume a palpable 
form, as is also indicated in the paying back in full of the just rewards in the next 
verse, and thus bear witness to the evil done. This highly developed idea of the 
Resurrection did not exist before the Quran. 

c (26) The meaning of this whole passage is made clear by the concluding 
words, i.e., nothing impure can be attributed to the pure ones, and they are free 
from what the impure ones say. 

d (27) The law revealed in this verse lays down the basis of domestic peace 
and security needed for an advanced society. It is also a preventive measure 
against slander. (Editor 's Note: This verse also supports the principle of having 
laws to safeguard the privacy of the individual within the home vis-a-vis the 
powers of the state authorities.)

visions. And Allah knows what you do openly and what you hide. 

30 Say to the believing men that they lower their gaze and 
restrain their sexual passions. That is purer for them. Surely Allah 
is Aware of what they do." 31 And say to the believing women that 
they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions and do not 
display their adornment except what appears of it. And they should 
wear their head-coverings over their bosoms. c And they should 
not display their adornment except to their husbands or their 
fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons 
of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their 
sisters' sons, or their women, or those whom their right hands 



a (30) Men are told to lower their gaze, just as women are enjoined to do in 
the next verse. This injunction is given as a preventive against the evil of illicit 
sexual relations. The Quran does not only forbid an evil, but also points out the 
way, by walking in which a person may be able to avoid it. Both men and women 
are required to keep their eyes cast down, so that when they meet each other, 
neither should men stare at women nor women at men. In a society in which 
women never appeared in public, the injunction to men to lower their gaze would 
be meaningless; and the similar injunction to women given in the next verse, if 
they never left the compounds of their houses, would be absurd. 

b (31-1) To guard the relations between males and females and to check a 
too free intermingling of men and women, the Quran requires women in particular 
not to display their adornment. But there is a clear exception here — except what 
appears of it or except that which it is customary and natural to uncover. What is 
prohibited is really the display of beauty, as elsewhere expressly indicated: "And 
do not display (your beauty) like the displaying of the earlier (days of) ignorance" 
(33:33). According to Ibn Jarir, the exception mentioned relates to the face and 
hands. As an argument corroborating this opinion he says that, when praying, the 
woman is not required to keep her face and hands covered — hands up to the 
elbow — while she is required to cover the rest of the body. According to Hadith, 
the Holy Prophet himself is reported to have told Asma, his wife Aishah's sister, 
when she appeared before him in thin clothes, through which parts of her body 
could be seen: 'Asma, when a woman attains her puberty it is not proper that any 
part of her body should be seen except this, and he pointed to his face and hands" 
(Abu Dawud, 31:30). This settles conclusively that Islam never enjoined the veil 
or covering of the face. 

c (31-2) Before Islam women used to appear in public with their breasts partly 
uncovered. The khimar (pi. khumr) means a head-covering, and women were thus 
required to cover their breasts with a part of their head-covering.

possess, or harmless male servants," or the children who do not 
know women's nakedness. And they should not strike their feet so 
that the adornment that they hide may be known. And turn to 
Allah all, O believers, so that you may be successful. 

32 And marry off those among you who are single (to 
spouses), and those who are fit among your male slaves and your 
female slaves. If they are needy, Allah will make them free from 
want out of His grace. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.* 
33 And those who cannot find a match must keep chaste, until 
Allah makes them free from want out of His grace. e And those of 



a (31-3) By theiv women are indicated all women who come in contact with 
them, or women who are on the same social level with them. Those whom their 
right hands possess include male and female slaves. Next to them are mentioned 
servants (called here as tahi'in or 'followers' because they follow the master), to 
which is added a qualifying phrase meaning, literally, not having need {of women) 
or lacking in cunning. These words mean male servants who take up service only 
as a means of living and not with the mischievous intention of getting intimacy in 
the house. It should be noted that women are nowhere forbidden to employ male 
servants or to appear before them. What this verse prevents is only display of 
female beauty except to those most nearly related to women, and this is a preven- 
tive measure against the spread of loose ideas of morality, and a step to help 
restraint of sexual passions, which is all that the Quran aims at. 

b (32) The Quran looks upon the married state as the normal state, and hence 
it enjoins that, so far as is possible, those who are single should be married. It also 
requires both male and female slaves to be kept in a state of marriage. The keep- 
ing of concubines is clearly inconsistent with this. Islam is against celibacy, and 
considers parenthood to be the duty of every human being. The Holy Prophet, too, 
laid stress on Muslim men and women living in a married state. Thus he said: "He 
who is able to marry should marry. For it keeps the gaze low and guards chastity; 
and he who cannot should take to fasting (occasionally), for it will have a castra- 
ting effect on him" (Bukhari, 30:10). On another occasion he said, addressing some 
young men who talked of fasting in the day-time and keeping awake for prayer 
during the night, and keeping away from marriage: "I keep fast and I break it, and 
I pray and I sleep, and I am married, so whoever inclines to any other way than 
my sunnah, he is not of me" (Bukhari, 67: 1). 

c (33-1) The words translated as those who cannot find a match may also 
mean those who cannot find the means to marry. Marriage thus becomes an obli- 
gatory institution in Islam, only those being excused who cannot find a match or 
who lack the means to marry. Marriage, in fact, affords the surest guarantee for 
the betterment of the moral tone of society.

your slaves who ask for a contract (to buy their freedom), give 
them the contract, if you know any good in them, and give them

And do not compel your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire 
to keep chaste, in order to seek the frail goods of this world's life. 
And whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion

clear messages and a description of those who passed away before 
you, and advice for those who guard against evil. 

Section 5: Manifestation of Divine Light 

35 Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth. A likeness 
of His light is as a pillar on which is a lamp — the lamp is in a 
glass, the glass is as it were a brightly shining star — lit from a 
blessed olive-tree, neither eastern nor western, whose oil gives light, 
even though fire does not touch it — light upon light. Allah guides 



a (33-2) The word kitdb, or writing, as used here, stands for a contract 
between a slave and his master for the former to purchase his freedom. Though 
the practice of the master making such a contract with the slave prevailed before 
the advent of Islam, the important reform introduced by Islam was that, when a 
slave desired such a contract to be made, the master could not refuse it. Twelve 
centuries before any attempt was made by any individual or community to legis- 
late for the liberty of slaves, a dweller in the Arabian desert had laid down this 
noble institution, that, if a slave asked for a writing of freedom, he was not only to 
be given that writing by the master, but he was also to be provided with money to 
purchase his freedom, the only condition being if you know any good in them, i.e., 
if he is fit for work and able to earn his livelihood. And, in addition, the duty was 
imposed upon the State of spending a part of the collection of the obligatory cha- 
rity (zakdf) for this object, as stated in 9:60. 

b (35) Allah is called here the light of the heavens and the earth because He 
has manifested hidden things and brought them into existence. Mishkat means a 
niche, but it also has the meaning of pillar. In this parable, Islam is represented as 
a likeness of the Divine light, a light placed high on a pillar so as to illuminate the 
whole world; a light guarded by being placed in a glass, so that no puff of wind 
can put it out; a light so resplendent that the glass itself in which it is placed is as 
a brilliant star. It should be noted that the religion of Islam is repeatedly spoken of 
as Divine light in the Quran: "They desire to put out the light of Allah with their 
mouths, but Allah will allow nothing except the perfection of His light, though the 
disbelievers are averse" (9:32, 61:8). Hence it is of Islam that the parable of

to His light whom He pleases. And Allah sets forth parables for 
mankind, and Allah is Knower of all things — 36 (that light is) in 
houses which Allah has permitted to be exalted and His name to 
be remembered within them. a Therein do glorify Him, in the 
mornings and the evenings, 37 men whom neither merchandise nor 
selling diverts from the remembrance of Allah and the keeping up 
of prayer and the giving of the due charity — they fear a day in 
which the hearts and the eyes will turn about, 38 that Allah may 
give them the best reward for what they did, and give them more 
out of His grace. And Allah provides without measure for whom 
He pleases. 

39 And those who disbelieve, their deeds are as a mirage in a 
desert, which the thirsty man thinks to be water, until, when he 



Divine light speaks. The blessed olive, from which that light is lit, and which 
stands here for a symbol of Islam, as the fig stands for a symbol of Judaism (see 
95:3), belongs neither to the East nor to the West. Even so is Islam, which must 
give light to both the East and the West, and which, therefore, does not specially 
belong to either of them. The reference seems to be to the welding together of the 
East and the West in Islam, a prophecy which is now approaching its fulfilment in 
the awakening of the West to the truth of the principles of Islam. 

The parable becomes clearer if light is taken to refer to the Holy Prophet. 
The Prophet was by nature gifted with the highest qualifications. Even before he 
received Divine revelation, his life was a life of purity and devoted to the service 
of humanity. Light emanated from him even before the light from on High came 
to him in the form of Divine revelation, so that when revelation came to him it 
was light upon light. 

a (36) The Divine light spoken of in the last verse is here stated as being met 
with in certain houses, the distinctive mark of those houses being that the name of 
Allah is remembered in them, thus showing that these houses are the houses of 
Muslims, and the light is therefore the light of Islam. These houses, we are further 
told, though humble now, will be exalted. And the exaltation of the humble huts 
of the Arab dwellers of the desert to royal palaces is a fact of history. 

b (37) In these houses Allah is glorified in the morning and the evening, and 
therefore these can be the houses of no other than Muslims, because the keeping up 
of prayer and the giving of the due charity is the distinguishing characteristic of 
Islam. The opposition to His light, and the end of that opposition, are described in 
verses 39^40. The turning about of the hearts and the eyes means either that they 
will be transformed in the new life or that they will be in a state of commotion by 
reason of fear. The verse that follows lends support to the first meaning. 



24:40* MANIFESTATION OF DIVINE POWER 441 

comes to it, he finds it to be nothing, and he finds Allah with him, 
so He pays him his due. And Allah is Swift at reckoning — 40 or 
like darkness in the deep sea — a wave covers him, above which 
is another wave, above which is a cloud — (layers of) darkness 
one above another — when he holds out his hand, he is almost 
unable to see it. And to whom Allah does not give light, he has no 
light." 

Section 6: Manifestation of Divine Power 

41 Do you not see that Allah is He Whom do glorify all those 
who are in the heavens and the earth, and the birds with wings 
outspread? Each one knows its prayer and its glorification. And 
Allah is Knower of what they do. 42 And Allah's is the kingdom of 
the heavens and the earth, and to Allah is the eventual coming. 
43 Do you not see that Allah drives along the clouds, then gathers 
them together, then piles them up, so that you see the rain coming 
forth from their midst? And He sends down from the heaven 
(clouds like) mountains, in which is hail, afflicting with it whom 
He pleases and turning it away from whom He pleases. The flash 
of His lightning almost takes away the sight. 44 AUah causes the 
night and the day to succeed one another. Surely there is a lesson 
in this for those who have sight. 45 And Allah has created every 
animal of water. So among them is that which crawls on its belly, 
and among them is that which walks on two feet, and among them 
is that which walks on four. c Allah creates what He pleases. 



a (40) As the first part of the section gives a picture of the brilliant and dazz- 
ling Divine light given to the believers, the last part describes the utter darkness of 
doubt and ignorance in which the disbelievers are. Their apparent hopes of 
success are compared with a mirage, and, when they are undeceived of these, they 
will find themselves in the presence of God and will have their dues paid to them. 

b (45-1) Here only animals are spoken of as having been created from water, 
but in 21:30 we are told that all life, whether animal or plant, has been created 
from water. 

c (45-2) The various kinds of animal life are here divided into three classes: 
(1) The creeping things, the lowest and the first form in the development of 
animal life. (2) Those walking upon two legs, such as birds, the second form of 
the development of animal life. Man, though walking on two legs, is not included

whom He pleases to the right way. 47 And they say: We believe in 
Allah and in the Messenger and we obey; then some of them turn 
away after this, and they are not believers. 48 And when they are 
invited to Allah and His Messenger that he may judge between 
them, then some of them turn aside. 49 And if the right is on their 
side, they hasten to him in submission. 50 Is there in their hearts a 
disease, or are they in doubt, or do they fear that Allah and His 
Messenger will deal with them unjustly? But they themselves are 
the wrongdoers. 

Section 7: Establishment of the Kingdom of Islam 

51 The response of the believers, when they are invited to Allah 
and His Messenger that he may judge between them, is only that 
they say: We hear and we obey. And these it is that are successful. 
52 And he who obeys Allah and His Messenger, and fears Allah and 
keeps duty to Him, these it is that are the achievers. 53 And they 
swear by Allah with their strongest oaths that, if you command 
them, they would certainly go forth. Say: Do not swear (oaths); 
reasonable obedience (is desired). Surely Allah is Aware of what 
you do. 54 Say: Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you 
turn away, he is responsible for the duty imposed on him, and you 
are responsible for the duty imposed on you. And if you obey him, 
you go aright. And the duty of the Messenger is only to deliver the 
message clearly. 

55 Allah has promised to those of you who believe and do 
good that He will surely make them rulers in the earth as He made 
those before them rulers, and that He will surely establish for them 
their religion, which He has chosen for them, and that He will 
surely give them security in exchange after their fear. They will 
serve Me, not setting up any partner with Me. And whoever is 



in them, because human life is the highest form of the development of animal life, 
and it is generally mentioned as quite distinct from all animal life. (3) Those 
which walk on four legs, and to this class belong most of the mammals.

the Fire. And it is indeed an evil destination! 

Section 8: Respect for Privacy

possess and those of you who have not attained to puberty ask per- 
mission of you three times: Before the morning prayer, and when 
you put off your clothes for the heat of noon, and after the prayer 
of night. These are three times of privacy for you; besides these it 



a (55) This verse not only prophesies the establishment of the kingdom of 
Islam, but also its permanence, so that successors will be raised to the Holy Prophet 
and the Muslims made a ruling nation on earth. By those before them are meant in 
particular the followers of Moses. Islam at the time of the revelation of these verses 
was still surrounded by enemies on all sides; there was still fear for the believers, 
as the verse clearly shows, and idol-worship still had the upper hand in Arabia. 
The triumph of Islam, which is prophesied in the parable of the Divine Light first, 
and the gradual advent of which is referred to afterwards, is here predicted in the 
clearest and most emphatic terms: the believers will be made rulers in the earth; 
their religion will be firmly established; security will be given to them in place of 
fear; Divine Unity will rule supreme. All these favours will be bestowed upon the 
Muslims, for which they should be thankful; but, if they are ungrateful after that, 
they shall be dealt with as transgressors. The word kafara, to be "ungrateful", also 
means to disbelieve, and would mean here a denial in practice, or disobedience to 
Divine commandments. 

There is also a reference here to the Divine promise to raise reformers (sing. 
mujaddid) among the Muslims, as prophets were raised among the Israelites. 
Such is the clear promise contained in a saying of the Holy Prophet: "Surely Allah 
will raise up for this people (i.e., the Muslims) in the beginning of every century 
one who will revive for it its religion" (Abu Dawud, 36:1). The promise given in 
the verse may therefore refer not only to the temporal successors of the Holy 
Prophet, but also to his spiritual successors or reformers. The analogy of the 
Israelites, to which the verse refers, points to the appearance of a Messiah among 
the Muslims as a Messiah was raised among the Israelites, and it was on this verse 
that the claim of the late Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, the founder of 
the Ahmadiyya movement, was based. He claimed to be a reformer {mujaddid) for 
the fourteenth century of the Hijra and the Messiah whose advent among the 
Muslims was foretold.

is no sin for you nor for them, (that) you go round about each other. 
Thus does Allah make clear to you the messages. And Allah is 
Knowing, Wise. a 59 And when the children among you attain to 
puberty, they should seek permission as those before them sought 
permission. Thus does Allah make clear to you His messages. And 
Allah is Knowing, Wise. 

60 And (as for) women past childbearing, who do not hope 
for marriage, it is no sin for them if they put off their (outer) clothes 
without displaying their adornment. And if they are modest, it is 
better for them. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 

61 There is no blame on the blind man, nor any blame on the 
lame, nor blame on the sick, e nor on yourselves that you eat in your 
own houses, or your fathers' houses, or your mothers' houses, or 
your brothers' houses, or your sisters' houses, or your paternal 
uncles' houses, or your paternal aunts' houses, or your maternal 
uncles' houses, or your maternal aunts' houses, or (houses) of 
which you possess the keys, or your friends' (houses). It is no sin 
in you that you eat together or separately. So when you enter 
houses, greet your people with a salutation from Allah, blessed 
(and) goodly. Thus does Allah make clear to you the messages 
that you may understand. 



a (58) Rules relating to personal and family privacy are of the utmost impor- 
tance in the betterment of social relations, and their non-observance leads to all 
kinds of false reports, which scandal-mongers are always ready to lay hold upon, 
thereby creating dissensions in society. 

b (60) The word used signifies a woman who has ceased to bear children and 
to have the menstrual discharge. The reference in putting off clothes is to the 
over-garment spoken of in 33:59. 

c (61) The Arabs had their scruples in eating with the blind, etc., in which 
respect they were like the Jews and some other people, including Hindus. Islam 
lays down a middle rule, and allows the individual a great latitude in this respect. 
A man may eat alone or with others, he may eat with the maimed, etc., or he may 
eat in the houses of near relations and friends. The latter part of the verse shows 
that a certain degree of familiarity with near relatives is recommended, so that one 
can take food with them, even though he may not have been invited specially. 



24 : 62 • MATTERS OF STATE TO TAKE PRECEDENCE 445 

Section 9: Matters of State to take Precedence 

62 Only those are believers who believe in Allah and His 
Messenger, and when they are with him on an important matter, 
they do not go away until they have asked permission from him. 
Surely they who ask permission from you, are they who believe in 
Allah and His Messenger; so when they ask permission from you 
for some affair of theirs, give permission to whom you will from 
among them, and ask forgiveness for them from Allah. Surely 
Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

63 Do not make the Messenger's calling among you as your 
calling of one another." Allah indeed knows those who steal away 
from among you, concealing themselves. So those who go against 
his order should beware that a trial may afflict them or there may 
befall them a painful punishment. 

64 Now surely Allah's is whatever is in the heavens and the 
earth. He knows indeed your condition. And on the day when they 
are returned to Him, He will inform them of what they did. And 
Allah is Knower of all things. 



a (63) It does not mean how the Prophet is to be addressed, but in what 
manner his call is to be responded to. The context makes it clear. The previous 
verse states that none is to leave without the Prophet's permission, when they are 
gathered together for some important matter requiring their presence, and the words 
that follow this passage are to the same effect. What is stated here is that the 
Prophet's call to the believers is to be respected, and not to be treated as their 
calling of one another; because the Prophet's call relates to some important affair 
affecting the welfare of the community, while their mutual calling of one another 
relates to their own private affairs. 



Chapter 25 
Ai-Fwqan The Criterion 

The name of this chapter, Al-Furqan, meaning criterion, distinction or discri- 
mination, is one of the names of the Holy Quran because of the distinction it 
brings about between truth and falsehood. It deals with the great transfor- 
mation which the Quran brought about in the lives of those who accepted it. 
At the outset it declares that the Holy Prophet's message is for all nations of 
the world. It goes on to assert the truth of the warning conveyed by the Holy 
Prophet and prophesies that a discrimination will be finally made between 
good and evil. It then draws lessons from the fate of previous peoples as well 
as from phenomena in nature. It ends with a description of the righteous, 
showing the transformation in people that the Quran was to effect. This chapter 
was revealed entirely at Makkah, most probably in the last period. 



Section 1 : A Warner for all Nations 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Blessed is He Who sent down the Criterion upon His servant 
that he might be a warner to the nations a — 2 He, Whose is the 
kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Who did not take to 
Himself a son, and Who has no partner in the kingdom, and Who 
created everything, then ordained for it a measure.* 3 And they 
take besides Him gods who create nothing, while they are them- 
selves created, and they control for themselves no harm nor 
benefit, and they do not control death, nor life, nor raising to life. 



a (1) As this chapter deals with the mighty transformation which the Quran 
had brought about in the lives of the people, it is mentioned here by the name 
Furqan (criterion for distinguishing or discriminating between truth and false- 
hood). The words "he might be a warner to the nations" show that the transfor- 
mation which was being brought about in Arabia would ultimately extend over the 
whole world and all nations would benefit. 

b (2) Verses 2 and 3 speak of the different kinds of polytheistic beliefs 
prevailing in the world, which were all destined to be swept away by the doctrine 
of Divine Unity as preached by Islam.

25:4« A WARNER FOR ALL NATIONS 447 

4 And those who disbelieve say: This is nothing but a lie, which 
he has forged, and other people have helped him at it. So indeed 
they have brought an injustice and a falsehood. 5 And they say: 
Stories of the ancients, which he has got written, so they are read 
out to him morning and evening!" 6 Say: He has revealed it, Who 
knows the secret of the heavens and the earth. Surely He is ever 
Forgiving, Merciful. 

7 And they say: What a Messenger is this? He eats food and 
goes about in the markets. Why has not an angel been sent down 
to him to be a warner with him? c 8 Or a treasure given to him, or a 
garden from which to eat? And the evildoers say: You follow 



a (5) In the previous verse, their allegation is that the Quran is a forgery; 
here they allege that the Prophet had caused some stories of the ancients to be 
written down by some people who helped him and it was these stories which were 
recited to him and which he gave out as a revelation from on High. How could 
mere stories bring about the transformation which the Quran was working in the 
hearts of people? Attention to this is drawn in the next verse. 

b (6) The secrets of the heavens and the earth which are known to God alone 
include the secrets of human nature. Transformation in people's lives has always 
been brought about by means of Divine revelation, and mortal efforts have ever 
failed in changing the hearts of people. 

c (7) The Holy Prophet's life was one of the utmost simplicity. He did all his 
work himself. He aided his wives in their household duties, mended his clothes, 
tied up the goats, and even cobbled his sandals. In fact, his kind and genial nature 
often led him to do others' work. Once a woman, unable to work for herself, 
asked him to lead her into a certain street; he accompanied her there, only taking 
leave when her work was accomplished. He was a mortal, and partook of the ordi- 
nary food of a simple Arab. Hence they speak of him as eating food. The answer 
to this is given in v. 20, viz., that all prophets were mortal and subject to human 
laws, as was the Holy Prophet. 

d (8) Their idea of a messenger of God was that he should be rolling in 
wealth. In fact, wealth was all in all to them and they paid no consideration to the 
moral, the higher, values of life for which the Prophet came. They were at the 
same time told that, though the Muslims had to suffer privations, they would be 
rewarded for their sacrifices in this very life. Treasures were placed at the feet of 
the companions of the Holy Prophet, and they were given gardens. But all this 
happened in accordance with Divine law, which requires the fulfilment of 
prophecy to be brought about gradually, even as it requires all growth to be 
gradual in the physical world.

Section 2: Truth of the Warning 

10 Blessed is He Who, if He please, will give you what is 
better than this: Gardens in which rivers flow. And He will give 
you palaces. n But they deny the Hour, and We have prepared a 
burning Fire for him who denies the Hour. 12 When it sees them 
from a far-off place, they will hear its raging and roaring. 13 And 
when they are cast into a narrow place in it, in chains, they will 
there pray for destruction. 14 Do not pray this day for destruction 
once but pray for destruction again and again. 15 Say: Is this better 
or the Garden of Perpetuity, which the dutiful are promised? That 
is a reward and a destination for them. 16 They shall have in it what 
they desire, to abide. It is a promise to be prayed for from your 
Lord. c 

17 And on the day when He will gather them, and what they 
serve besides Allah, He will say: Was it you who led astray these 
My servants, or did they themselves stray from the path? 18 They 
will say: Glory be to You! It was not befitting for us to take for 
protectors others besides You, but You made them and their 
fathers to enjoy until they forgot the Reminder, and they became a 
lost people. ^ 19 So they will call you liars in what you say, then 



a (9) Elsewhere, the disbelievers are quoted as saying: "Why was not this 
Quran revealed to a man of importance in the two towns?" (43:31). Nothing except 
rank or wealth had any importance in their eyes. Their very conception of the real 
values of life was wrong, so they could not find a way. 

b (10) These words contain a clear prophecy that the Prophet and his follow- 
ers will receive the good things of this life too. The gardens of Mesopotamia, the 
palaces of Persia and of the Caesars, were given to the companions of the Holy 
Prophet. 

c (16) The Garden is promised to the faithful but they should pray to their 
Lord for its bestowal, because prayer to God is the means by which it can be 
attained. 

d (18) The words it was not befitting for us to take for protectors others 
besides You show that those who worshipped God alone could not ask their 
followers to worship others than God. The reference is clearly to Jesus Christ.

you can neither avert (punishment), nor (obtain) help. And 
whoever among you does wrong, We shall make him taste a great 
punishment. 

20 And We did not send before you any messengers but they 
surely ate food and went about in the markets. And We make some 
of you a trial for others. Will you bear patiently? And jour Lord is 
ever Seeing." 

Section 3: The Day of Discrimination 

21 And those who do not look for meeting with Us, say: Why 
have not angels been sent down to us, or (why) do we not see our 
Lord? Indeed they are too proud of themselves and revolt in great 
revolt. 22 0n the day when they will see the angels, there will be 
no good news for the guilty, and they will say: Let there be a 
strong barrier! e 23 And We shall turn to the work they have done, 
so We shall render it as scattered dust. 

24 The owners of the Garden will on that day be in a better 
abiding-place and a fairer resting-place. 25 And on the day when 
the heaven bursts apart with clouds, and the angels are sent down, 
as they are sent/ 26 The kingdom on that day rightly belongs to the 



a (20) This is an injunction to the Muslims to bear the persecutions of their 
opponents patiently, for these trials will distinguish the bad from the good. The 
concluding words are a solace to them: your Lord is ever Seeing — He will 
punish the oppressors. 

b (21) The coming of the angels and the Lord signifies the coming of the 
threatened punishment, and the next verse makes it clear; see 2:210. 

c (22) The words "strong barrier" bear different interpretations according to 
whether they are taken to be spoken by the angels or by the guilty. In the former 
case, the meaning is that good news will be a forbidden thing to the guilty, which 
is equivalent to saying that they will be punished. In the latter case, the words are 
a kind of prayer for the coming of a barrier between them and their punishment. 

d (23) All the exertions of the Quraish were brought to naught in the battle 
of Badr, and all attempts to uproot Truth are dealt with similarly. 

e (25) This description of the day of Badr is also given in 8:11-12, where the 
falling of rain is clearly mentioned, and on the same occasion is also mentioned 
the coming of the angels. The next verse shows that it will be a day of victory for 



450 25. THE CRITERION • 25 : 27 

Beneficent, and it will be a hard day for the disbelievers. 27 And on 
the day when the wrongdoer will bite his hands, saying: If only I 
had taken a way with the Messenger!" 28 woe is me! If only I 
had not taken such a one for a friend! 29 Certainly he led me astray 
from the Reminder after it had come to me. And the devil ever 
deserts man. 

30 And the Messenger will say: My Lord, surely my people 
treat this Quran as a forsaken thing. 31 And thus have We made for 
every prophet an enemy from among the guilty, and sufficient is 
jour Lord as a Guide and a Helper. 32 And those who disbelieve 
say: Why has not the Quran been revealed to him all at once? It is 
so that We may strengthen jour heart with it and We have 
arranged it well in arranging.* 33 And they cannot bring you a 
question, but We have brought you the truth and the best 
explanation^ 34 Those who will be gathered to hell on their faces 
— they are in an evil plight and straying farther away from the 
path. 



the Muslims, the believers in the Beneficent, and a hard day for the disbelievers. 
In fact, the distress and hardship the Quraish experienced in the battle of Badr 
were not tasted by them in any of their subsequent encounters with the Muslims. 

a (27) Commentators have here mentioned the names of some people who 
fought with the Prophet at Badr. But the statement is general and the evildoer 
often regrets the evil he did, when he suffers the consequences of the evil done. 

b (32) The Quran was revealed piecemeal so that, under the varying circum- 
stances through which the Prophet passed, the Divine revelation might be a source 
of strength to his heart; and then, as it were, to refute any suggestion that the 
revelation might remain a disorderly collection of fragments revealed under 
different circumstances, it is added that the entire arrangement was also Divinely 
accomplished. The arrangement of the Quran, according to this verse, was a part 
of the Divine scheme, brought about in the lifetime of the Holy Prophet. 

c (33) This verse lays down the basis of an important principle, namely, that 
the Quran not only contains answers to all objections against it, but also adduces 
arguments of the truth of the assertions made. No other religious book of the 
world satisfies this requirement, which circumstance alone places the Quran above 
all scriptures, and points to it as a unique revelation capable of satisfying the spiri- 
tual requirements of all people in all times. 



25:35' LESSON IN THE FATE OF FORMER PEOPLE 45 1 

Section 4: A Lesson in the Fate of Former People 

35 And certainly We gave Moses the Book and We appointed 
with him his brother Aaron, an aider. 36 Then We said: Go, both of 
you, to the people who reject Our messages. So We destroyed 
them with utter destruction. 37 And the people of Noah, when they 
rejected the messengers, We drowned them, and made them a sign 
for people. And We have prepared a painful punishment for the 
wrongdoers — 38 And Ad and Thamud and the dwellers of Rass 
and many generations in between." 39 And to each We gave 
examples and each did We destroy with utter destruction. 4 40 And 
indeed they pass by the town on which was rained an evil rain. e 
Do they not see it? But they hope not to be raised again. 

41 And when they see you, they take you only for a jest: Is 
this he whom Allah has raised to be a messenger? 42 He had almost 
led us astray from our gods, if we had not adhered to them 
patiently! And they will know, when they see the punishment, 
who is more astray from the path. 43 Have you seen him who takes 
his low desire for his god? d Will you be a guardian over him? 
44 0r do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are 
only as the cattle; rather, they are farther astray from the path. 

Section 5: A Lesson from Nature 

45 Do you not see how jour Lord extends the shade? And if 
He pleased, He would have made it stationary. Then We have 



a (38) According to some, Rass was a country in which a part of the tribe of 
Thamud resided; others say that Rass is the name of a town in Yamamah. 

b (39) The meaning is that every one of these generations was warned of its 
doom by citing examples of those who had previously perished, but, not heeding 
the warning, was destroyed. 

c (40) This town is Sodom, which was situated on the way to Syria. 

d (43) This verse shows how broad is the idea of shirk or polytheism accord- 
ing to the Quran. It is not simply worship of idols that is condemned, but blindly 
following one's desires is equally condemned. Many people who consider them- 
selves the servants of the One God really bow in submission before the greatest of 
their idols, i.e., their desire. The monotheistic doctrine has here been brought to a 
perfection not to be met with elsewhere.

made the sun an indication of it, 46 then We take it to Ourselves, 
taking little by little." 47 And He it is Who made the night a cover- 
ing for you, and sleep a rest, and He made the day to rise up again. 
48 And He it is Who sends the winds as good news before His 
mercy; and We send down pure water from the clouds, 49 that We 
may give life with it to a dead land, and give it for drink to cattle 
and many people that We have created. 50 And certainly We 
repeat this to them that they may be mindful, but most people only 
consent to denying. 

51 And if We pleased, We could raise a warner in every 
town. c 52 So do not obey the disbelievers, and strive against them a 
mighty striving with it. d 



a (46) This and the previous verse show that Allah deals mercifully with His 
servants. He would not destroy them all at once. The sun of righteousness had 
risen, and there were clear indications that the shadows of darkness would disappear, 
but, as in physical nature, they would not disappear suddenly, but gradually, dimini- 
shing little by little. 

b (49) The mercy of Allah, which appears in the form of rain in physical 
nature, comes spiritually in the form of revelation. As the pure water from the 
clouds gives life to a dead land, so does the pure water of revelation from Him 
raise the spiritually dead to life. 

c (51) The companions of the Holy Prophet no doubt had this in mind when 
they spread far and wide, taking his message and warning to every distant town. It 
should, however, be noted that the verse does not contradict the statement in 
35:24, and elsewhere, that a prophet was raised among every nation. The chapter 
opens with the statement that the Prophet was a warner to all nations. The state- 
ment made here shows that, if God had pleased, He would have raised a warner in 
every town, but the oneness of humanity, which was a grand object following 
upon the Oneness of God, could not have thus been brought about. Hence the 
verse that follows requires a hard striving on the part of the Prophet and his follo- 
wers for this grand achievement. 

d (52) This verse affords a clear proof of the significance of the word jihad, 
as used in the Quran. Every exertion to spread the Truth is, according to this verse, 
a jihad; in fact, it is called the jihad kabir ("mighty striving") or the great jihad. 
Fighting in defence of religion received the name of jihad, because under the 
circumstances it became necessary for the Truth to live and prosper; if fighting 
had not been permitted, Truth would surely have been uprooted. The commen- 
tators all accept this significance of the word here. It should be noted that the 
greatest jihad which a Muslim can carry on is one by means of the Quran, to 



25 : 53 • A LESSON FROM NATURE 453 

53 And He it is Who has made the two seas to flow freely, the 
one sweet, very sweet, and the other saltish, bitter. And between the 
two He has made a barrier and inviolable obstruction." 54 And He 
it is Who has created man from water, then He has made for him 
blood-relationship and marriage-relationship. And your Lord is 
ever Powerful. 

55 And they serve besides Allah that which can neither bene- 
fit them, nor harm them. And the disbeliever is ever an aider 
against his Lord. e 56 And We have not sent you but as a giver of 
good news and as a warner. 57 Say: I ask of you no reward for it 
except that whoever wishes may take a way to his Lord. 58 And 
rely on the Ever-Living Who does not die, and celebrate His 
praise. And sufficient is He as being Aware of His servants' sins, 
59 Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between 
them in six periods, and He is established on the Throne of Power, 
the Beneficent. So ask respecting Him one aware. 60 And when it 
is said to them: Be submissive to the Beneficent, they say: And 
what is the Beneficent? Shall we be submissive to what you order 
us? And it adds to their aversion. 



which the personal pronoun it at the end of the verse unquestionably refers, 
because such jihad must be carried on by every Muslim under all circumstances. 

a (53) Apparently the reference is to the sweet-water rivers flowing on earth 
or underground and to the saltish sea-water. But there is a deeper reference to the 
two lives which man leads on earth, a sweet life of faith and goodness, which 
brings satisfaction and peace to the mind, and a bitter life of faithlessness and 
wickedness, which ever increases the thirst for material gains and never brings 
satisfaction to the mind of man. Both existed in the world side by side, and so 
they would continue. 

b (54) The passage seems to hint at the flight to Madinah. The Prophet was 
related to the Makkans through his father, and to the Madinans through his mother. 
As his blood-relations had persecuted him and were bent upon killing him, he is 
now reminded of his relationship through marriage to another people. It was no 
doubt due to some such hint in the Divine revelation that the Prophet was 
searching, on the occasion of the pilgrimage, for adherents among the people of 
Madinah. 

c (55) The disbeliever aided the cause of untruth, as against his Lord, while 
the Prophet aimed at establishing the Truth in the world. 

d (59) The one aware is the Prophet, who possessed true knowledge of God.

Section 6: The Transformation brought about 

61 Blessed is He Who made the stars in the heavens and made 
therein a sun and a moon giving light! 62 And He it is Who made 
the night and the day to follow each other, for him who desires to 
be mindful or desires to be thankful." 

63 And the servants of the Beneficent are they who walk on 
the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they 
say, Peace! 64 And they who pass the night prostrating themselves 
before their Lord and standing. 65 And they who say: Our Lord, 
avert from us the punishment of hell; surely its punishment is a 
lasting evil: 66 It is surely an evil abode and resting-place! 67 And 
they who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor miserly, 
and the just mean is ever between these. 68 And they who do not 
call upon another god with Allah, nor slay the soul which Allah 
has forbidden, except in the cause of justice, nor commit 



a (62) The night is here spoken of as being the more opportune time for 
being mindful, i.e., for prayers, and the day for being thankful, i.e., for work and 
livelihood. 

b (63) From here to the end of the chapter is described the great transforma- 
tion which the Prophet had already brought about. The great qualities spoken of as 
being met with in the servants of the Beneficent present a striking contrast with 
the evils which reigned supreme in Arabia. They were an arrogant people, who 
trampled the rights of their fellow-beings under their feet, but the faithful now 
walked in humility and led lives of lowliness, in which they had the greatest 
regard for others' rights (v. 63). In the days of ignorance they passed their nights 
in drunken orgies, but now they kept awake at night in devotion and were instead 
drunk with the love of God (v. 64). In the days of ignorance they spent money 
extravagantly, when it was a question of pride, and they did not care for the poor 
dying of hunger, but now they spent every penny they could on others (v. 67). 
Formerly idols were worshipped in Arabia, human blood was shed on the slightest 
pretext, sex-relations were loose to an extreme, but they had now become the torch- 
bearers of Divine Unity, for whose sake they willingly suffered every privation, 
homicide was looked upon with abhorrence, the highest value was placed on the 
chastity of men and women, and righteousness was the one thing in which men 
and women vied with one another (v. 68-71). Truth and faithfulness were the 
great qualities that ruled people's minds, in the new dispensation, and a life full of 
vigour and earnestness was seen in the place of ignorance, superstition and 
immorality, which were the chief features of pre-Islamic Arabia (v. 72-74).

fornication; and he who does this shall meet a penalty of sin — 
69 The punishment will be doubled to him on the day of Resurrec-

repents and believes and does good deeds; for such Allah changes 
their evil deeds to good ones." And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merci- 
ful. 71 And whoever repents and does good, he surely turns to 
Allah a (goodly) turning. 

72 And they who witness no falsehood, and when they pass 
by what is vain, they pass by nobly. 73 And they who, when 
reminded of the messages of their Lord, do not fall down at them 
deaf and blind. 74 And they who say, Our Lord, grant us in our 
wives and our offspring the joy of our eyes, and make us leaders 
for those who guard against evil. 75 These are rewarded with high 
places because they are patient, and are met there with greetings 
and salutation, 76 abiding there — a goodly abode and resting- 
place! 77 Say: My Lord would not care for you, if it were not for 
your prayer. Now indeed you have rejected, so the punishment 
will come. 



a (70) Here we are plainly told that the transformation had already been 
wrought; the vices in which the people indulged formerly had been changed to 
good and righteous deeds, and those who found pleasure in evil deeds now found 
pleasure in the doing of good. It was the soul-force of the Prophet that had 
wrought this miraculous transformation. 

b (72) They not only shunned falsehood but were now above everything that 
was vain or futile. 

c (75) Apparently they were being expelled from their homes but they felt as 
if they were being rewarded with high places, because their outlook on life was 
now spiritual and not material. In addition to the greetings and salutations of the 
angels they were promised greetings and salutations in their new centre of 
activity, Madinah, to which they were fleeing, because there a similar brotherhood 
of the righteous was now ready to receive these emigrants. 

d (77) The Truth had finally been rejected by the Makkans, so the disgrace 
and abasement which was promised for the opponents of Truth was now awaiting 
them. The righteous were finally separated from the wicked, so the punishment 
must come. 



Chapter 26 

Al-Shu'ara' The Poets 

The title of this chapter is taken from a reference to poets in v. 224, where the 
allegation is refuted that the Quran is the work of a poet. It opens by consol- 
ing the Holy Prophet that he need not be anxious because of the rejection of 
his message by the people or despair of their reform. Then the histories of 
several prophets are narrated, presenting the fate of their opponents as a war- 
ning to the Holy Prophet's opponents, and finally the subject reverts to their 
objections against him. This chapter, and the two following it, belong to the 
middle period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : The Prophet is consoled 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Benignant, Hearing, Knowing God." 2 These are the verses 
of the Book that makes manifest. 3 Perhaps you will kill yourself 
with grief because they do not believe. c 4 If We please, We could 
send down on them a sign from heaven, so that their necks would 



a (1) This verse consists of the letters fa, sin and mim, which may stand for 
the names of God: Lafif, meaning Benignant, Sami', meaning Hearing, and 'Alim, 
meaning Knowing. I may, however, suggest another interpretation. These chapters 
speak in particular of the calling of Moses at Mount Sinai, so fa sin may stand for 
Tur Sina', or Mount Sinai, and mim may stand for Moses; attention is thus called 
in these letters to the revelation granted to Moses at Mount Sinai, which bears 
testimony to the truth of the Prophet. This is corroborated by the plain statement 
made in the last chapter of this group, that the disbelievers called the revelations 
of Moses and Muhammad two enchantments backing up each other (28:48). 

b (2) The Quran makes manifest all that is needed for a right development of 
the human faculties, and it also makes manifest the whole truth. 

c (3) The Prophet was informed by Divine revelation of the doom of an evil 
generation, but instead of cursing it, he exerted himself heroically to save his people 
by bringing about a mighty transformation among them, a transformation for 
which he was so anxious that he is described here as almost killing himself with 
grief.

bend before it. a 5 And no new Reminder from the Beneficent 
comes to them but they turn away from it. 'They indeed reject, so 
the news will soon come to them of that at which they mock. 
7 Do they not see the earth, how many of every noble kind We 
cause to grow in it? 8 Surely in this is a sign, yet most of them do 
not believe. 'And surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful. ° 

Section 2: Moses is called and sent to Pharaoh 

10 And when jour Lord called Moses, saying: Go to the wrong- 
doing people — "the people of Pharaoh. Will they not guard 
against evil? 12 He said: My Lord, I fear that they will reject me. 
13 And my heart is anxious, and my tongue is not eloquent, so send 
for Aaron (too). 14 And they have a crime against me, so I fear that 
they will kill me. 15 He said: By no means; so go both of you with 
Our signs; surely We are with you, Hearing. 16 Then come to 
Pharaoh, and say: We are bearers of a message of the Lord of 
the worlds: 17 Send with us the Children of Israel. 

18 (Pharaoh) said: Did we not bring you up as a child among 
us, and you stayed (many) years of your life among us? 19 Andyou 
did (that) deed of yours which you did and you are ungrateful. 



a (4) Such a sign was sent in the battle of Badr and again in the conquest of 
Makkah. In the former place their chiefs were laid low, and in the latter they 
accepted submission. 

b (6) It was the prophecies of their own defeat and of the predominance of 
Islam at which they mocked. 

c (9) Seven prophets in all are spoken of in this chapter, and it is related how 
the enemies of every one of them were exterminated in the final triumph of the 
Truth. Yet to give an indication of the fate of the Prophet Muhammad's opponents 
each prophet's mention is ended with the two attributes of the Divine Being men- 
tioned here, the Mighty, the Merciful, the first of these indicating that Truth will, 
even now, be made to overcome all opposition and the second that the dealing 
with the opponents of the Prophet would be a merciful dealing. The Prophet's 
opponents were defeated indeed but they were not destroyed and a reformed 
people rose again to power. 

d (14) The reference is to the killing of the Egyptian, as mentioned in 28:15. 
It is stated here that the people of Pharaoh charged Moses with a crime, not that 
he was actually guilty. See v. 20 and 28:15.

20 He said: I did it then when I was in error." 21 So I fled from you 
when I feared you, then my Lord granted me judgment and made 
me a messenger. 22 And is it a favour, of which you remind me, 
that you have enslaved the Children of Israel? 

23 Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the worlds? 24 He 
said: The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between 
them, if you would be sure. 25 (Pharaoh) said to those around him: 
Do you not hear? 26 He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers 
of old. 27 (Pharaoh) said: Surely your messenger, who is sent to 
you, is mad. 28 He said: The Lord of the East and the West and all 
that is between them, if you have any sense. 29 (Pharaoh) said: If 
you take a god besides me, I will certainly put you in prison. e 
30 He said: Even if I show you something plain? 31 (Pharaoh) said: 
Show it, then, if you are truthful. 32 So he threw down his staff, and 
lo! it was an obvious snake; 33 and he drew forth his hand, and lo! 
it appeared white to the onlookers. 

Section 3: Moses and the Enchanters 

34 (Pharaoh) said to the chiefs around him: Surely this is a 
skilful enchanter, 35 who desires to turn you out of your land with 
his enchantment. What is it then that you advise? 36 They said: 
Give him and his brother respite and send heralds into the cities 
37 that they bring to you every skilful enchanter. 38 So the enchanters 
were gathered together for the appointment of a well-known day, 



a (20) The circumstances in which Moses' act of striking an Egyptian with 
his fist led to the death of the Egyptian are related in 28:15. There was no inten- 
tion to kill the man, nor did Moses use any weapon with which death could be 
caused. The words "I was in error" (dall) indicate one perplexed, being unable to 
know what was incumbent on him. He used his fist against the oppressor, and 
death was simply accidental. 

b (22) The Israelites were employed only in menial work by Pharaoh and the 
Egyptians; it is this subjection to hardship which is here called enslavement. 

c (29) The gods of the Egyptians were innumerable. There were abstract gods, 
cosmic gods, human gods and animal gods. Pharaoh's claim to divinity among a 
people who were willing to deify anything has, therefore, nothing strange about it. 

d (33) See 7:108 and 20:20, 20:22, and the footnotes there. 



26 : 39 • MOSES AND THE ENCHANTERS 459 

39 and it was said to the people: Will you gather together? 
40 Perhaps we may follow the enchanters, if they are triumphant. 

41 So when the enchanters came, they said to Pharaoh: Will 
there be a reward for us, if we are triumphant? 42 He said: Yes, and 
surely you will then be among those who are nearest (to me). 
43 Moses said to them: Throw down what you are going to throw. 
44 So they threw down their cords and their rods and said: By 
Pharaoh's power we shall most surely be victorious. 45 Then Moses 
threw down his staff, and lo! it swallowed up their fabrication. 
46 And the enchanters were thrown down prostrate — 47 They said: 
We believe in the Lord of the worlds, 48 the Lord of Moses and 
Aaron. 49 (Pharaoh) said: You believe in him before I give you 
permission; surely he is the chief of you who taught you enchant- 
ment, so you will soon come to know. Certainly I will cut off your 
hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you all. 
50 They said: No harm; surely to our Lord we return. 51 We hope 
that our Lord will forgive us our wrongs because we are the first 
of the believers. 

Section 4: Moses is delivered and Pharaoh drowned 

52 And We revealed to Moses, saying: Travel by night with 
My servants — you will be pursued. 53 And Pharaoh sent heralds 
into the cities (proclaiming): 54 These are indeed a small band, 
55 and they have surely enraged us, 56 and we are truly a vigilant 
multitude. 57 So We turned them out of gardens and springs, 58 and 
treasures and goodly dwellings — 59 Even so. And We gave them 
as a heritage to the Children of Israel. " 

60 Then they pursued them at sunrise. 61 So when the two 
groups saw each other, the companions of Moses cried out: Surely 
we are overtaken. 62 He said: By no means; surely my Lord is with 



a (59) The pronoun them refers to gardens and springs, etc., in general, and 
not to the particular gardens, etc., from which the Egyptians were turned out. The 
heritage of gardens and treasures was given to the Israelites in the land of Canaan, 
the promised land flowing with milk and honey.

to the sea with jour staff." So it parted, and each side was like a 
huge mound. ' 64 And there We brought the others near. 65 And We 
saved Moses and those with him, all. 66 Then We drowned the 
others. 67 Surely there is a sign in this, yet most of them do not 
believe. 68 And surely jour Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful. 

Section 5: History of Abraham 

69 And recite to them the story of Abraham. 70 When he said 
to his sire and his people: What do you worship? 71 They said: We 
worship idols, so we shall remain devoted to them. 72 He said: Do 
they hear you when you call (on them), 73 or do they benefit or 
harm you? 74 They said: But we found our fathers doing so. 

75 He said: Do you then see what you worship — 76 you and 
your ancient sires? 77 Surely they are an enemy to me, but not (so) 
the Lord of the worlds, 78 Who created me, then He shows me the 
way, 79 and Who gives me to eat and to drink, 80 and when I am 
sick, He heals me, 81 and Who will cause me to die, then give me 
life, 82 and Who, I hope, will forgive me my mistakes on the day of 
Judgment^ 83 My Lord, grant me wisdom, and join me with the 
righteous, 84 and ordain for me a goodly mention in later genera- 
tions, 85 and make me from among the heirs of the Garden of bliss, 
86 and forgive my sire, surely he is in error, 87 and do not disgrace 



a (63-1) This expression is similar to the one occurring in 2:60: "March on 
to the rock with your staff". Elsewhere the same idea is expressed by saying: 
"Strike for them a dry path in the sea, not fearing to be overtaken, nor being 
afraid" (20:77); see also 2:50. 

b (63-2) The sea had gone back, thus leaving a dry path (20:77) for the 
Israelites. The meaning may be that each wave, as it receded, was like a huge 
mound. 

c (82) The prophets, being always conscious of their weakness, seek Allah's 
protection. Expressions like this invariably indicate human weakness before Divine 
perfection, and are not evidence of sinfulness. Compare Jesus' confession of 
weakness in a similar strain: "Why do you call me good? No one is good but One, 
that is, God" (Matthew, 19:17).

made manifest to the deviators, fl 92 and it is said to them: Where 
are those that you worshipped 93 besides Allah? Can they help you 
or help themselves? 94 So they are hurled into it, they and the 
deviators, 95 and the followers of the devil, all. 96 They will say, 
while they quarrel in it: 97 By Allah! We were certainly in manifest 
error, 98 when we made you equal with the Lord of the worlds. 
"And none but the guilty led us astray. 100 So we have no inter- 
cessors, 101 nor a true friend. 102 Now, if only we could return once,

their brother Noah said to them: Will you not guard against evil?

Allah and obey me. 109 And I ask of you no reward for it: my 
reward is only with the Lord of the worlds. 110 So keep your duty

the lowest (people) follow .you? 112 He said: And what knowledge 
do I have of what they did? 113 Their reckoning is only with my 
Lord, if you could perceive. 114 And I am not going to drive away 
the believers; 115 I am only a plain warner. 

116 They said: If you do not give up, Noah, you will certainly 
be stoned to death. 117 He said: My Lord, my people call me a liar. 
118 So judge between me and them openly, and deliver me and the 
believers who are with me. 119 So We delivered him and those with

123 Ad rejected the messengers. 124 When their brother Hud 
said to them: Will you not guard against evil? 125 Surely I am a 
faithful messenger to you: 126 So keep your duty to Allah and obey 
me. 127 And I ask of you no reward for it: my reward is only with 
the Lord of the worlds. 128 Do you build on every height a monu- 
ment, being vain? 129 And you make fortresses that you may abide 
forever. 130 And when you seize (people), you seize as tyrants. 
131 So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 132 And keep your duty 
to Him Who aids you with what you know — 133 He aids you with 
cattle and children 134 and gardens and fountains. 135 Surely I fear for 
you the punishment of a grievous day. 

136 They said: It is the same to us whether _you admonish or 
do not admonish; 137 this is only a fabrication of the ancients, 
138 and we will not be punished. 139 So they rejected him, then We 
destroyed them. Surely there is a sign in this, yet most of them do 
not believe. 140 And surely jour Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.

as having been drowned who rejected and persecuted him; see also 11:42 foot-

building that should acquire renown as a sign of greatness. These lofty buildings

violence were committed by Ad, while they considered themselves safe in their

a (155) See 7:73 for Thamud. They are described in v. 149 as carving houses 
out of the mountains, and, as it appears from here and 54:28, the springs of water 
seem to have been few, and access to these was probably specially guarded, so 
that they were open only at particular times. For the she-camel, see 7:73. Salih 
seems to have demanded that the she-camel should be allowed to drink at such 
times. See 54:28, where it is stated that every share of the water will be attended 
by the she-camel, or that she will have access to water at all times when the others 
are allowed to drink. A similar demand as regards her pasture is contained in 
1 1 :64 in the words "Leave her to pasture on Allah's earth", followed by the same 
words as those following this demand for drink: "And do her no harm".

eruption.

d (187) A portion of the heaven signifies a punishment from heaven. 

e (188) The demand for the threatened punishment is always met with ex- 
pressions signifying that the matter rests in the hands of Allah. Such statements 
are really equivalent to saying that the thing will certainly come to pass.

there is a sign in this, yet most of them do not believe. 191 And 
surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful. 

Section 1 1 : Prophet's Opponents warned 

192 And surely this is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. 
193 The Faithful Spirit has brought it," 194 on&gt;&gt;our heart that^ou may 
be a warner, 195 in plain Arabic language. 196 And surely the same 
is in the Scriptures of the ancients. e 197 Is it not a sign to them that 
the learned ones of the Children of Israel know it? 198 And if We 
had revealed it to any of the foreigners, 199 and he had read it to 
them, they would not have believed in it. 200 Thus do We make it 
enter into the hearts of the guilty. 2 



a (193) The Faithful Spirit (al-ruh al-amin) is the angel Gabriel, who brought 
the Divine revelation to the Holy Prophet. The Prophet himself was known in 
Makkah as al-Amin or the Faithful one before revelation came to him. 

b (194) The words on your heart indicate that the Prophet's heart, being the 
receptacle of the mighty revelation, was truly responsive to the great truths con- 
tained in it. The high morals and the broad humanitarian truths which the Quran 
contains give us a true picture of the great mind. This is referred to in one of the 
earliest revelations: "And surely you have sublime morals" (68:4). The pithy but 
most beautiful statement of Aishah, the Prophet's wife, remains unsurpassed in 
depicting the character of the Holy Prophet. When asked about it she replied: His 
character is the Quran, meaning that all those wonderful pictures of moral subli- 
mity drawn in the Quran were pictures of the noble mind to which the Quran was 
revealed. 

c (196) The prophecies relating to the advent of the Prophet Muhammad, as 
met with in the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, are referred to very often in the 
Quran. The statement made here is, however, more comprehensive: They are met 
with in all ancient scriptures. See 3:81, where a covenant is spoken of as being 
made through all the prophets of the world with regard to the Prophet's advent. 
There is a reference in the next verse to the learned men of the Children of Israel 
in particular because the Jews and the Christians had long been in contact with the 
Arabs. 

rf(199) Because prophecy plainly showed that the Arabs were to be the 
recipients of the revelation; see Isaiah 42:11: "Let the wilderness and its cities lift 
up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits.". In the Old Testament, Kedar, the 
son of Ishmael, stands for the Arab nation. Hence earlier prophecy required that 
the final revelation should be granted to an Arab. 

e (200) The meaning is that the Quran was made to enter into their hearts by

201 They will not believe in it till they see the painful punish- 
ment: 202 So it will come to them suddenly, while they do not per- 
ceive; 203 then they will say: Shall we be given respite? 204 Do they 
still seek to hasten on Our punishment? 205 Have you then 
considered, if We let them enjoy themselves for years, 206 then 
what they are promised comes to them — 207 what they were made 
to enjoy will not avail them? 208 And We destroyed no town but it 
had (its) warners — 209 to remind. And We are never unjust. 
210 And the devils have not brought it. 211 And it is not befitting for 
them, nor have they the power to do (it). 212 Surely they are far 
removed from hearing it." 

213 So do not call upon another god with Allah or you would 
be among those punished. 214 And warn your nearest relations, 
215 and be gentle to the believers who follow you. 216 But if they 
disobey you, say: I am clear of what you do. 217 And rely on the 
Mighty, the Merciful, e 218 Who sees you when you stand up, 219 and 



reason of the convincing proof of its truth; but they rejected it, as the next verse 
shows. 

a (212) The argument here is similar to that advanced by Jesus when he said: 
"And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself" (Matthew, 12:26). 
The evil one cannot be the source of the Quran, for the Quran calls to righteous- 
ness. See also verses 221-223. 

b (214) When this verse was revealed, the Holy Prophet, standing on Mount 
Safa, invited every tribe by name, and when the representatives of all the tribes 
had gathered together — among them being also the Quraish and that inveterate 
enemy of the Holy Prophet, Abu Lahab — the Holy Prophet thus addressed them: 
"Tell me, if I were to inform you that a great army in the valley lies in wait to 
make a raid upon you, would you believe me?" "Yes!" was the reply in one voice, 
"for we have never found anything but truth emanating from your lips." "Then," 
said the Prophet, "know that I am a warner to you of an approaching punishment." 
"May you perish," cried out the ill-tempered Abu Lahab, "was it for this that you 
called us together?" (Bukhari, 65.26:2). 

c (217) The Prophet is here told to rely on the Mighty, the Merciful, the very 
words that are repeated at the end of almost every section of this chapter, thus 
showing that the fate of the opponents of former prophets was spoken of simply to 
warn his own opponents. The attribute of mightiness is used to indicate the power 
to punish the wicked, while mercy indicates the deliverance and triumph of the 
righteous, or a merciful dealing even with the opponents.

your movements among those who prostrate themselves. 220 Surely 
He is the Hearing, the Knowing. 

221 Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend? 
222 They descend upon every lying, sinful one — 223 they give ear, 
and most of them are liars. 224 And the poets — the deviators 
follow them. 225 Do you not see that they wander in every valley, 
226 and that they say that which they do not do? c 227 Except those 
who believe and do good and remember Allah much, and defend 
themselves after they are oppressed. And they who do wrong, 
will know to what final place of turning they will turn back. 



a (223) The subject of v. 212 is reverted to here. The opponents of the Quran 
would not listen to what is said in the Quran — they are far removed from hearing 
it, as stated in v. 212 — but they listen to what their leaders in evil say. 

b (225) That is, they pursue an aimless course, while the Prophet has a set 
purpose before him, and it is to make people walk in the ways of righteousness. 

c (226) The first suggestion of the disbelievers was that the Quran was the 
work of the devil. That being shown to be inconsistent with its very nature and 
with the righteousness it preached, they said that it was the work of a poet. As 
against this they are told that none of the characteristics of a poet's work are to be 
met with in the Quran. The poet never leads his followers to a life of righteous- 
ness, while the Quran was bringing about a pure transformation in the lives of 
those who followed it. Again, the poets say things which they do not practise, 
whereas the Prophet was not only a preacher of righteousness, but also an 
exemplar who translated into practice what he taught in words. And the weightiest 
consideration of all is that the poets cannot utter prophecies like those which are 
met with in the Quran. It is to this that attention is called in the next verse. 

d(221) The passage gives a description of the true believers in general, a 
new statement being introduced with ilia (except); or it may refer particularly to 
the poets from among the believers. 



Chapter 27 
Ai-Nami The Naml 

The title of this chapter is taken from the mention in v. 18 of a tribe known as 
the Naml in the story of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. It begins by 
dealing with the histories of Moses and Solomon, indicating the likeness of 
their lives with that of the Holy Prophet. He was a law-giver like Moses and 
eventually ruler of a kingdom as Solomon was, yet retained the simplicity of 
the life of Moses. The chapter then refers to the prophets Salih and Lot whose 
opponents were destroyed and goes on to prophesy the triumph of the faithful 
and to indicate that in the Holy Prophet's case this triumph would be gene- 
rally through the spiritual resurrection of his opponents rather than their 
destruction. This chapter belongs to the middle period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : A Reference to Moses' History 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Benignant, Hearing God! a These are the verses of the Quran 
and the Book that makes manifest: 2 A guidance and good news for 
the believers, 3 who keep up prayer and give the due charity, and 
they are sure of the Hereafter. 4 Those who do not believe in the 
Hereafter, We make their deeds seem good to them, but they 
blindly wander on. ' 5 These are they for whom is an evil punish- 
ment, and in the Hereafter they are the greatest losers. 6 And you 
are surely made to receive the Quran from the Wise, the Knowing. 

7 When Moses said to his family: Surely I see a fire; I will 
bring you from it some news, or bring you a burning brand, so that 
you may warm yourselves. 8 So when he came to it, a voice issued, 



a (1) See 26:1 footnote, for explanation. The letters here are fa and sin. 

b (4) By their deeds are meant the deeds which they ought to perform. Evil 
deeds are made to seem good to evildoers by the devil (6:43), while Allah 
commends good deeds. Elsewhere we have: "But Allah has endeared the faith to 
you and has made it attractive in your hearts, and He has made hateful to you 
disbelief and transgression and disobedience" (49:7).

27:9* A REFERENCE TO MOSES' HISTORY 469 

saying: Blessed is he who is in search of fire and those around it. a 
And glory be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds! 9 Moses, surely I 
am Allah, the Mighty, the Wise: 10 And throw down your staff. So 
when he saw it in motion as if it were a snake, he turned back 
retreating and did not return. O Moses, do not fear. Surely the 
messengers do not fear in My presence — n Nor he who does 
wrong, then does good instead after evil; surely I am Forgiving, 
Merciful, 12 and put your hand into your bosom, it will come forth 
white without evil, among nine signs to Pharaoh and his people. 
Surely they are a transgressing people. 

13 So when Our clear signs came to them, they said: This is 
clear enchantment. 14 And they denied them unjustly and proudly, 
while their souls were convinced of them. See, then, what was the 
end of the mischief-makers ! 

Section 2: History of Solomon 

15 And certainly We gave knowledge to David and Solomon/ 
And they said: Praise be to Allah, Who has made us excel many of 
His believing servants! 16 And Solomon was David's heir, and he 



a (8) The words man fi-l-nar ("who is in search of fire") have been 
explained in several ways, the best being that in which the word fl (lit., in) may be 
rendered as meaning after or in search of. According to another explanation, these 
words mean that which is in fire and the place where fire was seen by Moses to be 
burning is meant. The addition of the words those for whatever is) around it is to 
show that the whole of this land was blessed, because so many prophets for the 
guidance of humanity were raised there. That the fire was not a physical fire is 
suggested by commentators. This is in fact clear. The voice that came to Moses 
was the voice of God and it came in the manner in which the Divine call comes to 
all prophets. Moses received a Divine revelation, and what he saw was during a 
state of transformation. 

b (11) The word ilia, with which this verse opens, does not here mean except 
but is equivalent to waw (and). Being joined to the "not" in the previous passage, 
the correct translation of ilia here is and not, i.e. nor. 

c (15) The history of David and Solomon, being the history of the temporal 
greatness of the Israelites, forms really a part of the history of Moses, and 
reference to it is in fact prophetical, to show that Islam was also destined to rise to 
greatness temporally as well as spiritually.

said: O people, we have been taught the speech of birds," and we 
have been granted all sorts of things. Surely this is manifest grace. 

17 And his forces of the jinn and the men and the birds were 
gathered to Solomon, and they were formed into groups. 18 Until 
when they came to the valley of the Naml, c a Namlite said: 
O Naml, enter your houses, (so that) Solomon and his forces may 
not crush you, while they do not know. 19 So he smiled, wondering 
at her word, and said: My Lord, grant me that I may be grateful 
for Your favour which You have bestowed on me and on my 
parents, and that I may do good such as You are pleased with, and 
admit me, by Your mercy, among Your righteous servants. 

20 And he reviewed the birds, then said: How is it I do not see 
Hudhud, or is it that he is one of the absentees? 21 I will certainly 



a (16) Solomon's understanding the speech of birds may imply the use he 
made of birds in carrying messages from one place to another, these messages 
being metaphorically called the speech of birds. The reference here is to the great 
resources of Solomon's kingdom in his victorious marches against near and 
distant enemies. Note also that Solomon says: We have been taught. This shows 
that his people also knew that speech. 

b (17) The jinn were men belonging to certain mountain tribes whom Solo- 
mon had subjugated, fair may mean either birds or horse, i.e., cavalry, as this 
word is applied not only to birds but also to swift animals such as horses. 

c (18) Many of the fables regarding Solomon have been due to a misconcep- 
tion of the word naml, taken as meaning 'ant'. It should be noted that wadi-l-Naml 
cannot be properly translated as the valley of the ants, for Naml is a proper noun. 
According to the classical dictionary Taj al- 'Urus, the valley of the Naml is 
situated between Jibrin and Asqalan. And Namlah is the name of a tribe which 
literally signifies the eggs of the ants. The name Namlah used also to be given to a 
child in whose hands an ant was placed at its birth, because it was said such a 
child would be wise and intelligent. 

d (20) The opening words may mean either a review of birds or a review of 
horses; see v. 17. By Hudhud is not to be understood the lapwing, but a person of 
that name. In every language many of the proper names given to people will be 
found to be identical with the names of animals. The Arab writers speak of a king 
of Himyar as Hudad, which is almost identical with Hudhud mentioned in the 
Quran. The Bible speaks of a king of Syria, named Ben Hadad (1 Kings 15:18, 
etc.). The Muntaha-l-arab states that Hudhad was the name of the father of 
Balqis, the queen of Sheba. The verses that follow show clearly that Solomon was 
speaking of one of his own officers. The infliction of severe punishment on a

punish him with a severe punishment, or kill him, unless he brings 
me a clear excuse. 22 And he did not remain away long, then said: I 
have encompassed something you do not have comprehensive 
knowledge of, and I have come to you from Saba' with sure 
information a — 23 I found a woman ruling over them, and she has 
been given all sorts of things and she has a mighty throne. 24 I 
found her and her people adoring the sun instead of Allah, and the 
devil has made their deeds seem good to them and turned them 
from the way, so they do not go aright — 25 so that they do not 
worship Allah, Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens 
and the earth and knows what you hide and what you proclaim. 
26 AUah, there is no God but He, the Lord of the mighty Throne. 

27 He said: We shall see whether you speak the truth or 
whether you are a liar. 28 Take this letter of mine and hand it over 
to them, then turn from them and see what (answer) they return. 

29 She said: Chiefs, an honourable letter has been delivered to 
me. 30 It is from Solomon, and it is in the name of Allah, the 
Beneficent, the Merciful, 31 proclaiming, Do not exalt yourselves 
against me and come to me in submission. 

Section 3: History of Solomon 

32 She said: Chiefs, advise me in this affair of mine; I never 
decide an affair until you are in my presence. 33 They said: We are 
possessors of strength and possessors of mighty prowess. And the 
command is yours, so consider what you will command. 34 She 
said: Surely the kings, when they enter a town, ruin it and make 
the noblest of its people low; and that is what they do. 35 And 
surely I am going to send them a present, and to see what (answer) 
the messengers bring back. 

small bird by such a mighty monarch, as Solomon, and the exposition of the great 
religious doctrine of the Unity of God by the lapwing, are quite incomprehensible. 
a (22) Saba ' is the same as the Sheba of the Bible. The story as given here is 
not met with in the Bible, but it was known to Jewish rabbis. The Bible speaks of 
the coming of the queen of Sheba to Solomon with large presents to test him. See 
1 Kings 10 and 2 Chron. 9. And later on, it speaks of many strange women as 
Solomon's wives (1 Kings 1 1). 



472 27. THE NAML • 27 : 36 

36 So when (the envoy) came to Solomon, he said: Will you 
help me with wealth? But what Allah has given me is better than 
what He has given you. Indeed, you are exultant because of your 
present." 37 Go back to them, so we shall certainly come to them 
with forces which they have no power to oppose, and we shall 
certainly expel them from there in disgrace, and they shall be 
humbled. 

38 He said: Chiefs, which of you can bring me her throne 
before they come to me in submission? 39 0ne audacious among 
the jinn said: I will bring it to you before you rise up from your 
place; and surely I am strong, trustworthy for it. e 40 One having 
knowledge of the Book said: I will bring it to you in the twinkling 
of an eye. Then when he saw it settled beside him, e he said: This 
is of the grace of my Lord, that He may try me whether I am 



a (36) Why was Solomon angry on receiving a present from the queen? 
Later events, as narrated further on, show that the present sent to Solomon was a 
throne which was decorated either with nude art or with idolatrous paintings, or 
was offensive in some other way. Solomon's order in v. 38 to bring her throne to 
him shows clearly that by it was meant the throne which she had sent to him as a 
present, and his order in v. 41 to make alterations in this throne shows that the 
paintings on the throne were abhorrent to a true worshipper of God. 

b (38) As usual, the narrative here omits the return of the messengers to the 
queen, and her willingness to submit to Solomon on receiving the threat mention- 
ed in the last verse, and continues at the point where Solomon makes preparations 
to receive her. By her throne is meant the throne which she had sent as a present. 

c (39) The rising up from the place does not signify his standing up from the 
sitting posture, but his marching away from the place where he was at the time. 
The reference to being trustyworfhy shows that the execution of the work required 
an honest worker. The audacious jinn is apparently one of the Amalekites, who 
were men of large stature. 

rf(40-l) By one having knowledge of the Book is meant an Israelite as 
against the Amalekite referred to above. The literal meaning of the concluding 
words of the sentence is, before your gaze returns to you. It is the same as in the 
twinkling of an eye, the idea conveyed being that he could do it without delay. 

e (40-2) Strange and curious legends are introduced by some commentators 
on the supposition that the events narrated took place in immediate succession. 
The words so when he saw it settled beside him do not indicate that he saw it 
settled in the course of the conversation given in the previous passage. It is an 
altogether different incident. 



27 : 41 • HISTORY OF SOLOMON 473 

grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful, he is grateful only 
for the good of his own soul, and whoever is ungrateful, then 
surely my Lord is Self-sufficient, Bountiful. 41 He said: Alter her 
throne for her; we may see whether she follows the right way or is 
of those who do not go aright." 

42 So when she came, it was said: Was your throne like this? 
She said: It is as it were the same; and we were given the 
knowledge before about it, and we submitted. 43 And what she 
worshipped besides Allah prevented her; for she was from a dis- 
believing people. 44 It was said to her: Enter the palace. But when 
she saw it she thought it was a great expanse of water, and 
prepared herself to meet the difficulty/ He said: Surely it is a 
palace made smooth with glass. She said: My Lord, surely I have 
wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of 
the worlds/ 



a (41) As pointed out in v. 36 footnote, Solomon was offended by the throne 
which the queen sent him as a present because of the indecent or idolatrous paint- 
ings on it, and therefore before she came to him, he caused certain alterations to 
be made in the throne. The purpose of the alteration is given here in express words, 
whether she follows the right way. In fact, she seems to have invited Solomon in 
the symbolic language of the paintings on the throne to her religion of idolatry, 
and by making alterations Solomon indicated that he could not make a compromise 
with idolatry. 

b (42) By putting the question, was your throne like this? Solomon wanted to 
draw her attention pointedly to the alterations made. The queen's answer shows 
that her envoy had already told her that Solomon was offended by the present 
which she had sent — we were given the knowledge before about it. The sub- 
mission referred to in the act of surrendering her kingdom does not mean that she 
had turned a Muslim. This is made clear in v. 43; she was prevented from becom- 
ing a true Muslim owing to her worship of the sun. Hence submission to God 
comes later; see the concluding words of v. 44. 

c (44-1) The use of the word saq (lit. shank or lower leg) to signify difficulty 
or distress in many phrases is a recognized idiomatic usage in Arabic. The expres- 
sion used here means that she prepared herself to meet the difficulty. {Editor 's 
Note: The literal translation, she bared her legs, has been made the basis of many 
groundless, vulgar stories about this episode.) 

d (44-2) It appears that, in order to impress upon the queen that it was the 
unseen hand of God that worked in nature, Solomon made water to flow under the 
smooth glass floor of his palace. Thus he conveyed to her the message in symbolic

Section 4: Salih and Lot 

45 And certainly We sent to Thamud their brother Salih, saying: 
Serve Allah. Then lo! they became two factions, contending. 
46 He said: My people, why do you hasten on the evil before the 
good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of Allah so that mercy 
may be shown to you? 47 They said: We consider you and those 
withjou an evil omen. He said: (The cause of) your evil fortune is 
with Allah; rather, you are a people who are tried. 

48 And there were in the city nine persons who made mis- 
chief in the land and did not act aright." 49 They said: Swear to one 
another by Allah that we shall attack him and his family by night, 
then we shall say to his heir: We did not witness the destruction of 
his family, and we are surely truthful. 50 And they planned a plan, 
and We planned a plan, while they did not perceive. 51 See, then, 
what was the end of their plan, that We destroyed them and their 
people, all (of them). 52 So those are their houses fallen down 
because they did wrong. Surely there is a sign in this for a people 



language that God was the real force behind all, as she had conveyed to him the 
message of idolatry in the symbolic language of the throne she had sent him as a 
present. The queen mistook the glass for the water which ran beneath; and when 
Solomon drew her attention to it, she at once realized her own error in worship- 
ping outward objects, like the sun, while the real force or the source of life was 
Allah, Whose hand worked in these objects. Perhaps in words, too, he impressed 
on her the great message of Divine Unity. The result was that the queen accepted 
the religion of Solomon — / submit with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the 
worlds. The Quran here contradicts the Bible which holds that Solomon had gone 
over to idol-worship on account of his non-Israelite wives, while the Quran states 
that his wives were converts to his religion and believers in Divine Unity. 

a (48) There is no doubt a reference here to the enemies of the Holy Prophet, 
the chief of them being nine in number, eight of whom were slain at Badr, except 
Abu Lahab who died at Makkah on hearing the news of the defeat at Badr. 

b (49) There seems to be a prophetical reference here to the plot against the 
Holy Prophet, for the same plan was ultimately agreed upon by the Quraish to do 
away with him. One man from every tribe of the Quraish was selected and, taking 
the Prophet unawares, they were to thrust their swords into his body simul- 
taneously so that no particular tribe could be held guilty. This was agreed upon 
immediately before the Prophet's flight to Madinah, and thus the incident as 
relating to Salih is meant as a prophecy.

duty. 

54 And Lot, when he said to his people: Do you commit foul 
deeds, while you see? 55 Will you come to men lustfully rather than 
women? Indeed, you are a people who act ignorantly. 56 But the 
answer of his people was only that they said: Drive out Lot's 
followers from your town; surely they are a people who would 
keep pure! 57 But We delivered him and his followers except his 
wife; We ordained her to be of those who remained behind. 58 And 
We rained on them a rain; and evil was the rain on those who had 
been warned."

c (62) The manifestation of the marvellous power of God in nature, the crea- 
tion of the heavens and the earth, the sending down of rain, the making of rivers 
and mountains — all these wonderful signs of the existence of the Great Creator 
are here followed by another equally wonderful sign of the existence of God, the 
manifestation of His marvellous power in man. But mark the contrast. This mani- 
festation of the existence of God is not to be sought in the greatness and power of 
man as the conqueror of the forces of nature, but in his weakness in his great

67 And those who disbelieve say: When we have become dust

certainly been promised this — we and our fathers before; this is 
nothing but stories of the ancients! 69 Say: Travel in the earth, then 
see what was the end of the guilty! 70 And do not grieve for them, 
nor be distressed because of what they plan. 

71 And they say: When will this promise come to pass, if you 
are truthful? 72 Say: Maybe something of what you seek to hasten 
has drawn near to you. 73 And surely your Lord is full of grace to 
people, but most of them do not give thanks. 74 And surely your 
Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they manifest.

distress when, unable to find help from any source, he throws himself on the 
Divine threshold and seeks help from God. But what is more, this manifestation 
of God's power is beautifully mingled with prophecy — and He will make you 
successors in the earth. The distressed ones here are no other than the Muslims, 
who were being cruelly persecuted and tortured, and they are told that the mani- 
festation of God's power in making them rulers of the earth would be as great as it 
was in His creation of the heavens and the earth. This also shows the purpose 
underlying the narration of the histories of David and Solomon. 

a (66) Human knowledge cannot reach the life after death and God has given 
this knowledge to man through His revelation. But people are in doubt about it; in 
fact, they shut their eyes to it. 



27 : 76 • PASSING AWAY OF OPPOSITION 477 

76 Surely this Quran declares to the Children of Israel most of 
what they differ about. 77 And surely it is a guidance and a mercy 
for the believers. 78 Trulyyour Lord will judge between them by 
His judgment, and He is the Mighty, the Knowing. 79 So rely on 
Allah. Surely you are on the plain truth. 

80 Certainly you cannot make the dead to hear, nor can you 
make the deaf to hear the call, when they turn back retreating. a 
81 Nor can you lead the blind out of their error. 7ou can make none 
to hear except those who believe in Our messages, so they submit. 
82 And when the word comes to pass against them, We shall bring 
forth for them a creature from the earth that will speak to them, 
because people did not believe in Our messages.* 

Section 7: Passing away of Opposition 

83 And the day when We gather from every nation a company 
from among those who rejected Our messages, then they will be 
formed into groups. 84 Until, when they come (before Him), He 
will say: Did you reject My messages without comprehending 
them by knowledge? Or what was it that you did? 85 And the word 
will come to pass against them because they were unjust, so they 
will not speak. 86 Do they not see that We have made the night that 
they may rest in it, and the day to give light? Surely there are 
signs in this for a people who believe. 

87 And the day when the trumpet is blown, then those in the 



a (80) This verse is a clear testimony to what is meant by the Prophet's 
raising the dead; for here we are told that, if the dead turn back retreating, the 
Prophet cannot make them hear. Evidently this verse and the opening words of the 
next speak of the reprobate who shut their eyes and close their ears to all truth. 

b (82) By the creature from the earth that will speak to them are evidently 
meant people who are bent low upon earth. These people are the materialistic 
nations of the West who have lost all sense of the higher values of life. The 
coming forth of this creature, the dabbat al-ard, is one of the signs of the 
approach of the Hour according to the Hadith. But the Hour may mean either the 
day of Judgment or the doom of a people, and this verse gives us an indication 
that the Hour in this case stands for the doom of a nation; because here it is 
spoken of as being a punishment for not believing in the Divine messages.

heavens and those in the earth will be struck with terror, except 
such as Allah please. And all shall come to Him humbled. a 88 And 
you see the mountains, you think them firmly fixed — they shall

Allah, Who has made everything thoroughly. Surely He is Aware 
of what you do. 89 Whoever brings good, he will have better than 
it; and they will be secure from terror that day. 90 And whoever 
brings evil, these will be thrown down on their faces into the Fire.

has made it sacred, and His are all things, and I am commanded to

whoever goes astray — say: I am only a warner. 93 And say: Praise 
be to Allah! He will show you His signs so that you shall recog- 
nize them. Andyour Lord is not heedless of what you do. 



a (87) As a foretaste of what was in store for the rejectors of the Truth, the 
prophecy was also brought to fulfilment in this life. The whole of Arabia recog- 
nized the Holy Prophet as its temporal and spiritual head, and the proud oppo- 
nents were humbled. 

b (88) In the passing away of the mountains there is a clear reference to the 
removal of the mighty men who opposed the Prophet's preaching. This is also 
shown by the concluding words of the verse, which clearly speak of the punish- 
ment of the evil deeds by One Who is Aware of what they do. 

c (91) The statement here that the Prophet is commanded to serve the Lord 
of the city of Makkah contains an allusion that the servant of the Lord will be the 
lord of that city. 

d (93) Note the firmness of the tone in which the showing of signs is 
asserted. 



Chapter 28 
Ai-Qasas The Narrative 

This chapter is chiefly a narrative of the story of Moses. After relating events 
of the life of Moses it announces that a prophet like him had now appeared 
with true revelation like the revelation of Moses, and its opponents will be 
humbled. In the end it says that their great wealth will not make them 
successful and prophesies that the Holy Prophet will return to Makkah in 
triumph. This chapter belongs to the middle period at Makkah, although v. 85 
would appear to have been revealed when the Holy Prophet was fleeing from 
Makkah to Madinah. 



Section 1 : History of Moses — Infancy 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Benignant, Hearing, Knowing God! a 2 These are the verses 
of the Book that makes manifest. 3 We recite to you the story of 
Moses and Pharaoh with truth, for a people who believe. 4 Surely 
Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into 
parties, weakening one party from among them; he slaughtered 
their sons and let their women live. Surely he was one of the 
mischief-makers. 5 And We desired to bestow a favour upon those 
who were considered weak in the land, and to make them the 
leaders, and to make them the heirs, c 6 and to grant them power in 
the land, and to make Pharaoh and Haman and their forces see 
from them what they feared. 



a (1) See 26: 1 footnote, for explanation. 

b (4) The two parties were the Israelites and the Egyptians, the latter being 
made the taskmasters of the former. This refers no doubt to the persecutions of the 
Muslims. The Quraish, the stronger party, wanted to crush the weaker party of the 
Muslims. 

c (5) By making them heirs is not meant that they would be made heirs to 
Pharaoh's possession, but heirs to a kingdom in the promised land of Canaan. 
And this refers also to the establishment of the kingdom of Islam and the defeat of 
its persecutors. 

d (6) Haman seems to have been a minister of Pharaoh. He is spoken of

7 And We revealed to Moses' mother, saying: Suckle him; 
then when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear, 
nor grieve; surely We shall bring him back to you and make him a 
messenger (of Ours). 8 So Pharaoh's people took him up — he 
would be an enemy and a grief for them. Surely Pharaoh and 
Haman and their forces were wrongdoers. 9 And Pharaoh's wife 
said: A joy of the eyes to me and to you — do not kill him; maybe 
he will be useful to us, or we may take him for a son. And they did 
not perceive. 

10 And the heart of Moses' mother was free (from anxiety). a 
She would almost have disclosed it, if We had not strengthened her 
heart, that she might be one of the believers. u And she said to his 
sister: Follow him up. So she watched him from a distance, while 
they did not perceive. 12 And We did not allow him to be suckled 
before, so she said: Shall I point out to you the people of a house 
who will bring him up for you, and they will wish him well? 13 So 
We gave him back to his mother that she might be comforted, and 
not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is 
true. But most of them do not know.* 

Section 2: History of Moses — flees Egypt 

14 And when he attained his maturity and became full-grown, 
We granted him wisdom and knowledge. And thus do We reward 
those who do good (to others). 15 And he went into the city at a 
time of carelessness on the part of its people, so he found in it two 

again in v. 8 and 38, and also in 29:39 and 40:24, 36. Pharaoh and his counsellors 
feared that the Israelites, who were aliens in the land of Egypt, might one day 
become powerful and supreme in the land. Hence they oppressed and persecuted 
them in various ways. Yet the Divine intention was to bring about what Pharaoh 
feared. Such also was the Divine intention with regard to the persecuted Muslims. 

a (10) Her heart became free from anxiety on account of the assurance which 
she had received through Divine revelation; the words that follow show that her 
heart had been strengthened with patience, so it cannot be said to have become 
devoid, or free, of patience. 

b (13) The reference is clearly to the opponents of the Holy Prophet, who did 
not know that the promise of Allah, as given to the faithful, would prove true.

men fighting — one being of his community and the other of his 
enemies; and he who was of his community cried out to him for 
help against him who was of his enemies, so Moses struck him with 
his fist and killed him. He said: This is on account of the devil's 
doing; surely he is an enemy, openly leading astray." 16 He said: 
My Lord, surely I have done harm to myself, so protect me; so 
He protected him. Surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. 
17 He said: My Lord, because You have bestowed a favour on me, 
I shall never be a backer of the guilty. 

18 And (the next day) he was in the city, fearing, awaiting, 
when suddenly, he who had asked his assistance the day before 
was crying out to him for help. Moses said to him: You are surely 
clearly doing wrong. c 19 So when he desired to seize him who was 
an enemy to them both, he said: Moses, do you intend to kill me as 
you killed a person yesterday? Fou only desire to be a tyrant in the 
land, and you do not intend to be of those who act aright. 

20 And a man came running from the remotest part of the city. 
He said: Moses, the chiefs are consulting together to kill you, so 
depart (at once); surely I am one of your well-wishers. 21 So he 
went forth from it, fearing, awaiting. He said: My Lord, deliver 
me from the unjust people. 



a (15) The word "this", in Moses' statement, refers to the punishment which 
he had given to the Egyptian, the meaning being that it was on account of his 
devilish deed that the Egyptian had been so punished. The Rabbinical explanation 
of Exodus 2:12 is that the Egyptian merited death "because he had forced an 
Israelitish woman to commit adultery with him" (Jewish Encyclopedia, vol. ix, p. 
48). The Quran does not name the offence, but there is no doubt that it calls his 
offence a devilish deed. V. 17 shows clearly that Moses did not consider himself 
as one who had done an unjust deed or helped a guilty person. See also 26:14. 

b (16) Moses' prayer is not evidence of his being guilty, for the word zulm 
used here indicates making to suffer harm, loss, detriment or failure, and this is 
the meaning of zulm adopted in 7:160 and 18:33. The meaning here is that he had 
risked his own life in giving help to another. 

c (18) Moses helped the man on the first occasion because he was oppressed, 
but now this very man was oppressing another. Therefore he refused to help him.

Section 3: History of Moses — In Midian 

22 And when he turned his face towards Midian, he said: 
Maybe my Lord will guide me in the right path. 23 And when he 
came to the water of Midian, he found there a group of men 
watering, and he found besides them two women keeping back 
(their flocks). He said: What is the matter with you two? They said: 
We cannot water until the shepherds take away (their sheep) from 
the water; and our father is a very old man. 24 So he watered (their 
sheep) for them, then went back to the shade, and said: My Lord, 
I stand in need of whatever good You may send to me. 

25 Then one of the two women came to him walking bash- 
fully. She said: My father invites you that he may reward you for 
having watered for us." So when he came to him and related to 
him the story, he said: Do not fear, you are secure from the unjust 
people. 26 0ne of them said: Father, employ him; surely the best 
one you can employ is the strong, the faithful one. 27 He said: I desire 
to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you on condition 
that you serve me for eight years; but, if you complete ten, it will 
be of your own free will, and I do not wish to be hard on you. 
If Allah please, you will find me (to be) one of the righteous.* 



a (25) The commentators say this man was Shuaib, and Shuaib is mentioned 
by the name of Jethro in the Bible. 

b (27) In Moses' stay at Midian for ten years, there is a prophetical reference 
to the ten years of the Prophet's life at Madinah. The mention of eight years has 
another underlying significance, for it was after eight years that the Prophet came 
back to Makkah as a conqueror, a clear reference to which is contained further on 
in v. 85: He Who has made the Quran binding on you will surely bring you back 
to the Place of Return. This occurred exactly eight years after his Flight. That such 
is the real significance of relating this narrative is made clear in v. 45, where the 
Prophet is thus addressed: And you were not dwelling among the people of Midian, 
reciting to them Our messages. It is, as it were, to say that it was Moses who lived 
among the people of Midian, but his episode really conveys the news of what will 
happen to you. 

It may be added here that Moses was paid his wages, and the condition of his 
staying in Midian for eight or ten years was as much in his own interest as in the 
interest of Jethro, for as the Bible narrative shows, Pharaoh had died by the time 
that Moses' stay in Midian had come to an end. 



28 : 28 • HISTORY OF MOSES 483 

28 He said: That is (agreed) between me and you; whichever of the 
two terms I fulfil, there will be no injustice to me; and Allah is 
surety over what we say. 

Section 4: History of Moses — Prophethood and Mission 

29 Then when Moses had completed the term, and was travel- 
ling with his family, he perceived a fire on the side of the 
mountain. He said to his family: Wait, I see a fire; maybe I will 
bring you from it some news or a brand of fire, so that you may 
warm yourselves. 30 And when he came to it, he was called from 
the right side of the valley in the blessed spot of the bush: 
O Moses, surely I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds: 31 And throw 
downpour staff. So when he saw it in motion as if it were a snake, 
he turned away retreating, and did not look back. O Moses, come 
forward and do not fear; surely you are secure (here). 32 Insert jour 
hand into your bosom, it will come forth white without harm, and 
remain calm in fear. These two are two arguments from your 
Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. Surely they are a transgressing 
people." 

33 He said: My Lord, I killed one of them, so I fear that they 
may kill me. 34 And my brother, Aaron, he is more eloquent in 
speech than I, so send him with me as a helper to confirm me. 
Surely I fear that they would reject me. 35 He said: We will 
strengthen your arm with your brother, and We will give you both 
an authority, so that they shall not reach you. ' With Our signs, you 
two and those who follow you, will triumph. 

36 So when Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they 
said: This is nothing but fabricated deceit, and we never heard of 
it among our fathers of old! 37 And Moses said: My Lord knows 
best who comes with guidance from Him, and whose shall be the 
good end of the abode. Surely the wrongdoers will not be success- 
ful. 



a (32) See 7:108, 20:20,20:22. 

b (35) The meaning is, so that they will not be able to injure you. 



484 28. THE NARRATIVE • 28 : 38 

38 And Pharaoh said: Chiefs, I know no god for you besides 
myself; so kindle a fire for me, Haman, on (bricks of) clay, then 
prepare for me a tower, so that I may reach the God of Moses, and 
surely I think him a liar." 39 And he was unjustly proud in the land, 
he and his armies, and they thought that they would not be 
brought back to Us. 40 So We caught hold of him and his armies, 
then We cast them into the sea, and see what was the end of the 
wrongdoers. 41 And We made them leaders who call to the Fire, 
and on the day of Resurrection they will not be helped. 42 And We 
made a curse to follow them in this world, and on the day of 
Resurrection they will be hideous. 

Section 5: A Prophet like Moses 

43 And certainly We gave Moses the Book after We had 
destroyed the former generations — clear arguments for people 
and a guidance and a mercy, that they may be mindful. 44 And you 
were not on the western side when We revealed to Moses the 
commandment, nor were you among those present; c 45 but We 
raised up generations, then life became prolonged to them. And 
you were not dwelling among the people of Midian, reciting to 
them Our messages, but We are the Sender (of messengers). 



a (38) Pharaoh mocks at the idea of the Lord of the heavens and the earth, 
and derisively commands one of his ministers to prepare bricks — such being the 
significance of kindling afire on clay — and to erect a tower so that he may look 
into the heavens to discover the Lord of the heavens and the earth. 

b (41) Pharaoh is made a prototype of evil, and the opponents of the Prophet 
are warned that by walking in Pharaoh's footsteps they will meet a similar fate. 

c (44) Moses' prophecy about the advent of the Prophet — of a prophet like 
him from among the Ishmaelites, the brethren of the Israelites — was so clear that 
one would think that the Prophet was there at the side of the mountain and Moses 
saw him with his own eyes. The opening words of the next verse show that a very 
long time had elapsed between these two prophets. The prophecy of Moses of the 
advent of a prophet like him was fulfilled after about two thousand years, and yet 
none of the prophets who followed Moses had ever claimed to be a prophet like 
Moses, not even Jesus Christ, the last of the line of the Israelite prophets. 

rf(45) See v. 27. Moses lived in Midian for ten years, just as the Prophet 
passed ten years of his life at Madinah, yet what a transformation was wrought in 
the course of these ten years! This very fact was a clear proof of his truth. 



28 : 46 • A PROPHET LIKE MOSES 485 

46 And you were not at the side of the mountain when We 
called, but a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to 
whom no warner came before you, that they may be mindful. " 
47 And in case, if a disaster should befall them for what their hands 
have already done, they should say: Our Lord, why did You not 
send to us a messenger so that we might have followed Your 
messages and been from among the believers? 48 But (now) when 
the Truth has come to them from Us, they say: Why is he not given 
the like of what was given to Moses? Did they not disbelieve in 
what was given to Moses before? They say: Two enchantments 
backing up each other! And they say: Surely we are disbelievers 
in both. 49 Say: Then bring some (other) Book from Allah which 
is a better guide than these two, I will follow it — if you are 
truthful. e 50 But if they do not answer you, know that they only 
follow their low desires. And who is more in error than he who 
follows his low desires without any guidance from Allah? Surely 
Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. 

Section 6: The Truth of Revelation 

51 And certainly We have made the Word to have many 



a (46) The meaning of v. AA-A6 is: You were not there, but it was Divine 
mercy that put a prophecy into the mouth of Moses regarding you. This is made 
clear by the words a mercy from your Lord that you may warn.... The people to 
whom no warner had come before were the Arabs. Compare 32:3, 36:6. 

b (48) The disbelievers did not adopt any one firm position against the Holy 
Prophet, and whenever one objection was shown to be erroneous, they took refuge 
in another. At the advent of the Prophet they said that he should have received a 
revelation like the revelation of Moses, but when the likeness was pointed out to 
them, they said that both Moses and Muhammad were deceivers who enchanted 
people by their eloquence, the one helping the other, and therefore they believed 
neither in the one nor in the other. 

c (49) The meaning is that, if you do not admit the truth of either revelation, 
you should show some other revelation existing in the world, which should offer 
better guidance. This statement only draws attention to the fact that the revelation 
granted to Moses and that granted to the Holy Prophet both occupy a higher posi- 
tion than any other revelation. And this is in fact true, for among all the sacred 
books of the world the Bible occupies a position second only to the Quran. 



486 28. THE NARRATIVE • 28 : 52 

connections for their sake, so that they may be mindful." 52 Those 
to whom We gave the Book before it, they are believers in it. 
53 And when it is recited to them they say: We believe in it; surely 
it is the Truth from our Lord; we were indeed, before this, 
submitting ones. 54 These will be granted their reward twice, 
because they are steadfast, and they repel evil with good and 
spend (on good works) out of what We have given them. c 55 And 
when they hear idle talk, they turn aside from it and say: For us 
are our deeds and for you your deeds. Peace be on you! We do not 
desire the ignorant. 

56 Surely you cannot guide whom you love, but Allah guides 
whom He pleases; and He knows best those who walk aright. d 
57 And they say: If we follow the guidance with you, we should be 



a (51) What is implied here is that the word of Allah, as contained in the 
Quran, is made to have many points of connection with previous revelation, so 
that it may be the easier for them to be reminded of its truth. Even if they did not 
believe in previous revelation, the broad points of likeness in the principles of two 
different prophets appearing at such a distance of time from each other, among 
entirely different nations, and under totally different circumstances, and the fulfil- 
ment of the prophecies uttered by one in the other, afforded conclusive evidence 
of the truth of them both. 

b (52) It is not meant that all those who have previously been given the 
Scriptures believe in the Quran. The verse only draws attention to the fact that all 
believe in the truth of revelation from Allah, and they cannot deny the points of 
connection between the two revelations, the truth of the fundamental principles 
and the fulfilment of prophecies. But only those would believe who have sub- 
mitted themselves already to Allah, as the verse that follows shows. 

c (54) The reason for a double reward — which only means a greater reward 
— is given in the words that follow. They had to suffer persecution, and not only 
did they remain steadfast in these great trials, but they repelled the evil of their 
persecutors with good, and in addition to all this made great sacrifices by spend- 
ing in the cause of Truth. For double reward, see also 33:31 and 57:28. 

d (56) It is related that when Abu Talib was on his deathbed, the Holy 
Prophet asked him to believe in Divine Unity. Abu Jahl, being by him at the time, 
dissuaded him from doing so, saying that he should not desert the religion of his 
fathers. Abu Talib died an unbeliever, and the words you cannot guide whom you 
love were a comfort to the Prophet (Bukhari, 65.28:1). But the words are true in a 
general sense as well. The Prophet wished that all people should accept the Truth 
and better their lives. But all this was to be brought about gradually.

carried off from our country. Have We not settled them in a safe, 
sacred territory to which fruits of every kind are drawn? A sus- 
tenance from Us — but most of them do not know. a 58 And how 
many a town have We destroyed which exulted in its means of 
subsistence! So those are their abodes: they have not been dwelt in 
after them except a little. And We are ever the Inheritors. 6 59 And 
your Lord never destroyed the towns, until He had raised in their 
metropolis a messenger, reciting to them Our messages, and We 
never destroyed the towns except when their people were wrong- 
doers. 60 And whatever things you have been given are only a 
provision of this world's life and its adornment, and whatever is 
with Allah is better and more lasting. Do you not then understand? 

Section 7: Opponents shall be brought Low 

61 Is he to whom We have promised a goodly promise, which 
he will meet with, like him whom We have provided with the 
provisions of this world's life, then on the day of Resurrection he 
will be of those brought up (for punishment)? e 62 And the day 
when He will call them and say: Where are those whom you 
asserted to be My partners? 63 Those against whom the word has 
proved true will say: Our Lord, these are they whom we caused to 
deviate — we caused them to deviate as we ourselves deviated. 
We declare our innocence before You. Us they never worship- 
ped. 64 And it will be said: Call your associate-gods. So they will 



a (57) The verse speaks first of the unfounded fears of those who thought 
that the weakness of the Muslims would result in the seizure, death, or expulsion 
of those who accepted the faith of Islam. In reply they are told that the prophecies 
which declare Makkah to be a safe and sacred territory, to which people will flock 
in all ages, must come to fulfilment, and Makkah will ultimately be theirs for 
whose sake these prophecies were uttered. 

b (58) That is, even now the Divine kingdom will be established, and the 
true believers in God will be made masters of the country. 

c (61) There are two parties spoken of here: the Prophet and his followers, 
who have received a goodly promise from Allah, though weak and oppressed at 
the time, and the powerful enemy, who has all the provisions of life in his 
possession, but who will one day be called upon to receive judgment. 

d (63) By those against whom the word has proved true are meant the

the punishment. If only they had followed the right way! 

65 And the day He will call them, then say: What was the 
answer you gave to the messengers? 66 0n that day excuses will 
become obscure to them, so they will not ask each other." But as 
to him who repents and believes and does good, maybe he will be 
among the successful. "And your Lord creates and chooses whom 
He pleases. To choose is not theirs. Glory be to Allah and supremely 
exalted is He above what they set up as partners (with Him)! 
69 Andyour Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they 
proclaim. 70 And He is Allah, there is no God but He! His is the 
praise in this (life) and the Hereafter; and His is the judgment, and

the night and the day, that you may rest in it, and that you may 
seek of His grace (in the day), and that you may give thanks.

forth from among every nation a witness and say: Bring your proof. 
Then shall they know that the Truth is Allah's and what they forged 
will fail them. 



leaders in unbelief. Their saying Us they never worshipped shows that these very 
leaders are spoken of as the gods whom their followers worship. 

a (66) They will not be able to offer an excuse, for the vanity of the false 
excuses, which satisfied them here, would then become manifest to them. Nor 
will they ask each other, for each will know the falsity of the excuses of the 
others. 



28 : 76 • KORAH'S WEALTH LEADS HIM TO RUIN 489 

Section 8: Korah's Wealth leads him to Ruin 

76 Korah was surely from among the people of Moses, but he 
oppressed them, and We gave him treasures, so much so that his 
hoards of wealth would weigh down a body of strong men." 
When his people said to him: Do not exult; surely Allah does not 
love the exultant. 77 And seek the abode of the Hereafter by means 
of what Allah has given you, and do not neglect jour portion of 
the world, and do good (to others) as Allah has done good to you, 
and do not seek to make mischief in the land. Surely Allah does 
not love the mischief-makers. 78 He said: I have been given this 
only on account of the knowledge I have. Did he not know that 
Allah had destroyed before him generations who were mightier in 
strength than he and greater in assemblage? And the guilty are not 
questioned about their sins. 

79 So he went out to his people in his finery. Those who 
desired this world's life said: If only we had the like of what 
Korah is given! Surely he is possessed of mighty good fortune! 
80 But those who were given the knowledge said: Woe to you! 
Allah's reward is better for him who believes and does good, and 
none is made to receive this except the patient. 81 So We made the 
earth to swallow him up c and his abode. He had no army to help 
him against Allah, nor could he defend himself. 82 And those who 
had yearned for his place the day before began to say: Ah! (know) 
that Allah amplifies provision for whom He pleases of His ser- 
vants and restricts (it also); if Allah had not been gracious to us, 



a (76) The story of Korah, or Qarun, his revolt against the leadership of Moses 
and Aaron, and his being swallowed up by the earth, is given in the Bible in the 
book of Numbers, ch. 16. The only addition of any importance to the story as 
given in the Quran is the mention of his wealth, a fact noticed in Rabbinical litera- 
ture. There may be a reference in the mention of Korah's wealth to the modern 
materialistic tendency of making the accumulation of wealth the great object of 
life to the utter neglect of the Truth. The hankering after wealth and the amassing 
of gold leads undoubtedly to ruin, as it is leading the world today. 

b (78) They will not be asked to give any explanation for their sins, as Allah 
is All-Knowing. 

c (81) The meaning conveyed is that he perished. 



490 28. THE NARRATIVE • 28 : 83 

He would have humbled us. Ah! (know) that the ungrateful are 
never successful. 

Section 9: The Prophet will return to Makkah 

83 That abode of the Hereafter, We assign it to those who 
have no desire to exalt themselves in the earth nor to make 
mischief. And the good end is for those who keep their duty. 
84 Whoever brings good, he will have better than it; and whoever 
brings evil, those who do evil will be recompensed only for what 
they did. 

85 He Who has made the Quran binding on you will surely 
bring you back to the Place of Return." Say: My Lord knows best 
him who has brought the guidance and him who is in manifest 
error. 86 And you did not expect that the Book would be inspired to 
you, but it is a mercy from jour Lord, so do not be a backer of the 
disbelievers. 87 And let them not turn you aside from the messages 
of Allah after they have been revealed to you, and call (people) to 
your Lord and do not be of those who set up partners (with Allah). 
88 And do not call with Allah any other god. There is no God but 
He. Everything will perish but He. His is the judgment, and to 
Him you will be brought back. 



a (85) The "Place of Return" (ma 'ad) here has been taken to mean Makkah 
in classical interpretations, because the conquest of it was promised to the Prophet, 
so that it was the place to which he would return. But Makkah is really called the 
Place of Return because the pilgrims return to it. According to some, this verse was 
revealed on the Prophet's departure from Makkah, i.e., on his way to Madinah. It 
contains a clear promise of the Prophet being brought back to the city from which 
he was now being expelled. 



Chapter 29 
Ai-'Ankabat The Spider 

This chapter is entitled The Spider as v. 41 compares false beliefs with a spider's 
web, which shall be swept away by the current of truth. It begins by stating 
that believers must undergo trials and persecutions, even by their parents, before 
truth can triumph. These sufferings purify them. Then it relates histories of 
prophets who underwent suffering. It goes on to refer to the purifying effect 
of the Quran on the believers. Finally, it warns the opponents of their fate and 
comforts the believers by stating that their sufferings will change to a state of 
happiness and their exertions and striving in the cause of truth will be fruitful. 
Chapters 29 to 32 form one group revealed near the close of the early period 
at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Trials purify 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Best Knower." 2 Do people think that they

3 And indeed We tried those before them, so Allah will certainly 
know those who are true and He will know the liars . c 4 Or do they 
who work evil think that they will escape Us? Evil is it what they 
judge! 5 Whoever hopes to meet with Allah, the term of Allah is 
then surely coming. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing. 6 And 
whoever strives hard, strives for himself. Surely Allah is above 
need of (His) creatures.'' 7 And those who believe and do good, 



a (1) See 2:1 footnote, for explanation. 

b (2) By the trials spoken of in these verses are meant the persecutions of the 
believers by the disbelievers. This is made clear in v. 10. 

c (3) The knowing in this case relates to a knowledge of the event when it 
takes place, when reward or punishment is meted out to a person for what he 
does. 

rf(6) As shown under 25:52, the word jihad occurs in Makkan revelation 
frequently, and carries its proper significance of striving hard in Allah's way. The 
suffering of persecutions and tortures at the hands of their enemies for the sake of

if they strive to make you set up partners with Me, of which you 
have no knowledge, do not obey them.* To Me is your return, so I 
will inform you of what you did. 'And those who believe and do 
good, We shall surely make them enter among the righteous. 

10 And among people is he who says: We believe in Allah; 
but when he is persecuted for the sake of Allah, he thinks the per-

comes from jour Lord, they will say: Surely we were with you. Is 
not Allah the Best Knower of what is in the hearts of mankind? 
n And certainly Allah will know those who believe, and He will 
know the hypocrites. 12 And those who disbelieve say to those who 
believe: Follow our path and we will bear your wrongs. And they 
can never bear any of their wrongs at all. Surely they are liars.

besides their own burdens; and they will certainly be questioned on 
the day of Resurrection as to what they forged. 



their faith was no less a jihad for the Muslims at Makkah than their fighting in 
defence of Islam at Madinah. 

a (7) These words may signify either doing away with their afflictions or 
trials, or doing away with their evil deeds. I prefer the first because it is of the 
trials and afflictions of the believers that these verses speak. If the second signifi- 
cance is adopted, it would mean that the evil deeds which the believers did before 
they accepted the Truth would be effaced, because the course of their lives was 
now changed. 

b (8) This verse, while signifying the importance of obedience to parents, 
warns against attaching over-importance even to filial duty. It shows that when an 
important duty clashes with a still higher one, the former is to be sacrificed for the 
latter. 

c (10) The meaning is that those who are weak in faith consider the perse- 
cution by the disbelievers, which was necessary to strengthen and purify their faith, 
as if it were a punishment from Allah for their change of faith. The latter part of 
the verse is a prophecy as to what the weak in faith will say when they see the 
help of Allah coming to the Muslims. 

d (13) The Quran does not anywhere say that the burden of one shall be taken 
away by another. Each one is responsible for what he does. The "other burdens" 



29 : 14 • NOAH AND ABRAHAM 493 

Section 2: Noah and Abraham 

14 And We indeed sent Noah to his people, so he remained 
among them a thousand years save fifty years. " And the deluge 
overtook them, and they were wrongdoers. 15 So We delivered him 
and the inmates of the ark, and made it a sign to the nations. 

16 And (We sent) Abraham, when he said to his people: Serve 
Allah and keep your duty to Him. That is better for you, if you 
know. 17 You only worship idols besides Allah and you invent a 
lie. Surely they whom you serve besides Allah control no sus- 
tenance for you; so seek sustenance from Allah and serve Him and 
be grateful to Him. To Him you will be brought back. 

18 And if you reject, nations before you did indeed reject (the 
Truth). And the duty of the Messenger is only to deliver the 
message clearly. 19 Do they not see how Allah originates the crea- 
tion, then reproduces it? Surely that is easy to Allah. 20 Say: 
Travel in the earth then see how He makes the first creation, then 
Allah creates the latter creation. Surely Allah is Powerful over all 



are really their own burdens in misleading others, and thus the two burdens 
spoken of here are the burden of one's own wrongdoing and the burden of 
misleading others. 

a (14) The Bible gives 950 years to be the age of Noah. It is not improbable 
that the span of man's life may have been greater in his earlier history than at 
present, and Noah may have attained an extraordinary age among his compatriots. 
But there are indications that the reference here is to the abiding for 950 years of 
the law preached by Noah, his place then being taken by Abraham, as the mention 
of Abraham immediately afterwards shows. 

b (19) The law of creation and destruction of things, which is constantly 
working in nature, finds an expression in the lives of nations: a nation is brought 
into existence, then it is swept away and a new nation raised in its place. It is to 
this law that the verse refers as a warning to the idolatrous Makkans that the time 
had now come when their place would be taken by another nation. This is made 
clear in the verses that follow. It should be noted that verses 18-23 are paren- 
thetical, being an address to the opponents of the Holy Prophet. The Quran fre- 
quently adopts this method of warning in the middle of another narration, for its 
object is not to relate a story, but to warn those who opposed the spread of Truth 
as revealed to the Holy Prophet.

things." 21 He punishes whom He pleases and has mercy on whom 
He pleases, and to Him you will be turned back. 22 And you cannot 
escape in the earth nor in the heaven, and you have no protector or 
helper besides Allah. 

Section 3: Abraham and Lot 

23 And those who disbelieve in the messages of Allah and the 
meeting with Him, they despair of My mercy, and for them is a 
painful punishment. 24 But the answer of his people was only that 
they said: Kill him or burn him! But Allah delivered him from the 
fire. Surely there are signs in this for a people who believe. 
25 And he said: You have only taken idols besides Allah by way of 
friendship between you in this world's life, then on the day of 
Resurrection you will deny one another and curse one another; 
and your abode is the Fire, and you will have no helpers. 

26 So Lot believed in him. And he said: I am fleeing to my 
Lord. Surely He is the Mighty, the Wise. c 27 And We granted him 
Isaac and Jacob, and ordained prophethood and the Book among 
his offspring. And We gave him his reward in this world, and in 
the Hereafter he will surely be among the righteous. 

28 And (We sent) Lot, when he said to his people: Surely you 
commit foul deeds which none of the nations has done before you. 



a (20) Elsewhere, the words travel in the earth are always followed by then 
see what was the end of the rejectors, instead of which we have here how He 
makes the first creation, then Allah creates the latter creation. This shows that 
what is meant here is the disappearance of one nation to give place to another. 
(Editor 's Note: There may also be a hint here that by travelling in the earth one 
can find evidence of evolution, as Charles Darwin discovered by his travels.) 

b (24) As in 21:69, so here, it is not stated that Abraham was actually cast 
into the fire. On the other hand, the plan was either to kill or to burn him, and 
therefore the fire may only stand for the opposition which these plans involved. 

c (26) The words / am fleeing to my Lord indicate his flight to another country 
to where he was commanded to flee by his Lord. This is more clearly stated in 
19:48: 'And I withdraw from you," being followed by the statement in 19:49: "So 
when he withdrew from them". This makes it further clear that his deliverance from 
the fire was brought about by his flight to another country. 



29 : 29 • OPPOSITION TO TRUTH EVER A FAILURE 495 

29 Do you come to males and commit robbery on the highway, and 
commit evil deeds in your assemblies?" But the answer of his 
people was only that they said: Bring on us Allah's punishment, if 
you are truthful. 30 He said: My Lord, help me against the mischievous 
people. 

Section 4: Opposition to Truth ever a Failure 

31 And when Our messengers came to Abraham with good 
news, they said: We are going to destroy the people of this town, 
for its people are wrongdoers. 32 He said: Surely in it is Lot. They 
said: We know well who is in it; we shall certainly deliver him 
and his followers, except his wife; she is of those who remain 
behind. 33 And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was grieved 
on account of them, and he lacked strength to protect them. And 
they said: Do not fear, nor grieve; surely we will deliver you and 
your followers, except your wife — she is of those who remain 
behind. 34 Surely We are going to bring down upon the people of 
this town a punishment from heaven, because they transgressed. 
35 And certainly We have left a clear sign of it for a people who 
understand. 

36 And to Midian (We sent) their brother Shuaib, so he said: 
My people, serve Allah and fear the Last Day, and do not act 
corruptly, making mischief, in the land. 37 But they rejected him, 
so a severe earthquake overtook them and they lay prostrate in 
their abodes. 38 And Ad and Thamud! And some of their dwellings 
are indeed apparent to you. And the devil made their deeds seem 
good to them, so he kept them back from the path, and they could 
see clearly. 39 And Korah and Pharaoh and Haman! And certainly 
Moses came to them with clear arguments, but they behaved 



a (29) Three sins are ascribed to Lot's people — homosexuality, highway 
robbery, and openly committing evil deeds in their assemblies. Therefore it is a 
mistake to explain all incidents in connection with Lot's story only with reference 
to homosexuality as the sole evil of which they were guilty. 

b (35) Sodom and Gomorrah, the cities destroyed, are in the neighbourhood 
of the Dead Sea, on the road from Arabia: "And it is on a road that still abides" 
(15:76).

haughtily in the land; and they could not outstrip (Us). 40 So each 
one We punished for his sin. On some of them We sent a violent 
storm, and some of them the rumbling overtook, and some of them 
We caused the earth to swallow, and some of them We drowned." 
And it was not Allah, Who wronged them, but they wronged them- 
selves. 

41 The parable of those who take guardians besides Allah is 
as the parable of the spider that makes for itself a house; and 
surely the frailest of houses is the spider's house — if only they 
knew! 42 Surely Allah knows whatever they call upon besides 
Him. And He is the Mighty, the Wise. 43 And these parables, We 
set them forth for people, and none understand them but the learned. 
44 Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth. Surely there 
is a sign in this for the believers. 

Section 5: The Quran is a Purifier 

45 Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book and keep 

«- up prayer. Surely prayer keeps (one) away from indecency and 

evil; and certainly the remembrance of Allah is the greatest (force). 

And Allah knows what you do. e 46 And do not argue with the 



a (40) For these punishments, in order, see 7:72, 78, 84; 28:81; 2:50; 7:64. 

b (41) A trust in false deities, which stands for all false beliefs, is here com- 
pared with a spider's web to express the nature of its extreme frailty. It may pros- 
per for a time, but no sooner is the light of criticism and research brought to bear 
upon it than it vanishes and leaves no trace behind. This also refers to the plans of 
the Holy Prophet's opponents, which were destined to be brought to naught by 
reason of their inability to withstand the overwhelming advance of Truth. 

c (45) This verse invites the followers of all religions to accept the Quran on 
account of its purifying effect upon life, as the previous scriptures had ceased to 
effect deliverance from the bondage of sin. The verse also lays down the right 
principle for getting rid of the bondage of sin in the words the remembrance of 
Allah is the greatest, i.e., the most powerful and effective restraint upon sin. It is a 
living belief in the Divine power, knowledge, and goodness that restrains people 
from walking in the ways of His displeasure. 

The recitation of the Book, the keeping up of prayer, and the remembrance 
of Allah are really identical; for the Quran is recited in prayers, and the Quran is 
the best means of the remembrance of Allah. The Quran is pre-eminently a Book

29 : 47 • THE QURAN IS A PURIFIER 497 

People of the Book except by what is best," save such of them as 
act unjustly. But say: We believe in what has been revealed to us 
and revealed to you, and our God and your God is One, and to 
Him we submit. 47 And thus have We revealed the Book to you. c 
So those whom We have given the Book believe in it, and some of 
these (also) believe in it; and none deny Our messages except the 
disbelievers. 48 And you did not recite before it any book, nor did 
you transcribe one with your right hand, for then could the liars 
have doubted. 6 49 Rather, it is clear messages in the hearts of those 



that manifests the glory, greatness, grandeur, goodness, love, purity, power, and 
knowledge of the Supreme Being. While, as generally understood, by the rememb- 
rance of Allah is meant His glorification and praise in prayer, it is also here meant 
Allah's remembrance of man or His raising him to a place of eminence. Thus the 
significance would be that through prayer to God, not only is man freed from the 
bondage of sin, but (which is greater than this) he is raised to a place of higher 
eminence. 

a (46-1) The Quran here explains that it is the broad principles of religion 
that should demand paramount consideration. The fundamental principle of reli- 
gion is that God exists and that He reveals Himself to man, and it is common to 
all revealed religions. The only difference is that a Muslim's is a purer mono- 
theism, a conception of the Divine Being which gives the most perfect attributes 
to Him while declaring Him to be free from all imperfections and weaknesses, a 
conception which cannot reasonably be criticized by anyone who admits a belief 
in a Supreme Being. A Muslim's conception of Divine revelation is wider than 
that of the follower of any other religion, recognizing, as it does, that Divine reve- 
lation is granted in all ages and to all nations. A Muslim, therefore, admits the 
truth of all the prophets and revelations, and the follower of any other religion has 
nothing to lose but everything to gain by accepting Islam. 

b (46-2) The words "save such of them as act unjustly" do not mean that 
controversy is to be carried on with these in a different manner, but that the unjust 
would not accept this reasonable interpretation of the principles of religion. This 
is made clear in the verse that follows. 

c (47-1) And thus have We revealed the Book; that is, by confirming the truth 
of all previous revelation. 

d (41-2) The word these refers to Arabs, who possessed no sacred scriptures. 

e (48) The broad principles of religion and the beautiful moral and spiritual 
truths which find expression in the Quran could not have been collected, if such a 
collection by human exertion were possible, except by one who had knowledge of 
all the previous scriptures; but the Holy Prophet had not read even a single book. 
He could neither read nor write, and his inability to do either is thus a confir-

who are granted knowledge. And none deny Our messages except 
the wrongdoers. 

50 And they say: Why are not signs sent down upon him from 
his Lord? Say: Signs are with Allah only, and I am only a plain 
warner. 51 Is it not enough for them that We have revealed to you 
the Book which is recited to them? Surely there is mercy in this 
and a reminder for a people who believe. c 

Section 6: Warning and Consolation 

52 Say: Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you 
— He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. And those who 
believe in falsehood and disbelieve in Allah, these it is that are the 
losers. 53 And they askyou to hasten on the punishment. And if a 
time had not been fixed, the punishment would certainly have 
come to them. And certainly it will come to them all of a sudden, 
while they do not perceive. 54 They ask you to hasten on the punish- 
ment, and surely hell encompasses the disbelievers — 55 The day 



mation of his truth. Leaving aside all the principles and truths, if we consider the 
broad principles that Islam taught with regard to the truth of Divine revelation in 
all ages and to all nations, a truth never taught or recognized before the Holy 
Prophet, it is remarkable that such a broad truth should have been preached by 
one who had never read the scriptures of any religion and who lived in a country 
which was almost cut off from all communication with other countries. See also 
7:157 footnote 1. 

a (49) The Quran contains not only truths which are met with in previous 
scriptures, but also others which are not to be found in any scripture, and which 
are only in the hearts of the learned ones, or those that may ever be conceived by 
the learned ones. 

b (50) The Prophet is a warner, and gives warning in due time that the signs 
are with Allah, Whose power to send these signs they deny. Read also in this 
connection verses 53-55, which uphold the coming of the punishment, leaving no 
doubt as to the meaning of signs being with Allah. 

c (51) This is another reply to those who demanded signs. The Quran is a 
mercy, if they would only accept it. They could see how the believers had bene- 
fited by it; how a wonderful transformation had been wrought in their lives. 
Indeed, this was direct evidence of the truth of the Holy Word, for to effect a pure 
transformation in the lives of those who would follow it was its avowed object, 
while the overthrow of its enemies was only an indirect testimony.

when the punishment will cover them from above them, and from 
beneath their feet!" And He will say: Taste what you did. 

56 O My servants who believe, surely My earth is vast, so 
serve Me only. 57 Every soul must taste of death; then to Us you 
will be returned. 58 And those who believe and do good, We shall 
certainly give them an abode in high places in the Garden in which 
rivers flow, abiding in it. Excellent the reward of the workers, 
59 who are patient, and on their Lord they rely! 60 And how many a 
living creature does not carry its sustenance! Allah sustains it and 
yourselves. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing. c

earth and made the sun and the moon subservient, they would say:

fies provision for whom He pleases of His servants, and restricts 
(it) for him (also). Surely Allah is Knower of all things. 63 And if 
you ask them, Who is it that sends down water from the clouds, 
then gives life with it to the earth after its death, they will say:

stand. '

a (55) The expression used is simply to indicate the all-encompassing nature 
of the punishment, which will not leave them a way to escape. Compare 6:65. 

b (56) This is to comfort the Muslims against the severe persecutions by 
their enemies. If they are persecuted at Makkah, they will find a refuge elsewhere. 

c (60) This is a consolation to the Muslims that the giving up of their con- 
cerns and business at Makkah will not lead to their ruin. (Editor's Note: This 
verse also points out that, as in nature sustenance for all creatures is provided for 
by God, so it is a duty of man to ensure that all creatures continue to receive their 
sustenance for their survival.)

to Him in obedience; but when He brings them safe to the land, 
then they set up partners (with Him), 66 so as to be ungrateful for 
what We have given them, and that they may enjoy. But they shall 
soon know. 67 Do they not see that We have made a sacred terri- 
tory secure, while people are carried off by force from around 
them?" Will they still believe in falsehood and disbelieve in the 
favour of Allah? 

68 And who is more unjust than one who forges a lie about 
Allah, or calls the Truth a lie when it has come to him? Is there 
not an abode in hell for the disbelievers? 69 And those who strive 
hard for Us, We shall certainly guide them in Our ways. And 
Allah is surely with the doers of good. 



a (67) The haram ("sacred territory") includes the city of Makkah and 
several miles of territory around it. War is forbidden within these limits. The 
reference in people are carried off by force is to the great insecurity of life and 
property in Arabia, while no one dared violate the sacredness of Makkah. 



Chapter 30 
Ai-Rum The Romans 

This chapter is named after its prophecy of the victory of the Romans over the 
Persians. Disclosing this news, it also prophesies a great Muslim victory over 
their oppressors. The respective conditions of the two groups will soon be 
reversed, it adds. It goes on to say that the same Divine power which controls 
physical nature will bring about the triumph of Islam, and that as Islam 
appeals to man's inner nature itself it will be accepted universally. Finally, it 
states that a great moral transformation will be brought about in Arabia by 
Islam and the mighty opposition to it will be overthrown. Chapters 29 to 32 
form one group revealed near the close of the early period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : A Great Prophecy 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Best Knower." 2 The Romans are defeated 
3 in a near land, and they, after their defeat, will gain victory 



a (1) See 2:1 footnote, for explanation. 

b (3) The struggle between Persia and the Roman Empire had existed for a 
long time. In 602 C.E., Chosroes II of Persia began war with Rome: "His armies 
plundered Syria and Asia Minor, and in 608 advanced to Chalcedon. In 613 and 
614 Damascus and Jerusalem were taken by the General Shahabaraz, and the 
Holy Cross was carried away in triumph. Soon after, even Egypt was conquered. 
The Romans could offer but little resistance, as they were torn by internal 
dissensions and pressed by the Avars and Slavs" (Encyclopaedia Britannica, Art. 
"Chosroes II"). When the news of this conquest reached Makkah, the Quraish 
were jubilant, as their sympathies were with the fire-worshipping Persians more 
than with the Christians, who, being the followers of the scriptures, were classed 
by them with the Muslims. It was in 615 or 616 C.E. that this revelation came to 
the Prophet, containing two different prophecies, one about the defeat of the 
victorious Persians, who had reached the very gates of Constantinople, by the 
Romans, who were by this time quite exhausted, and the other about the defeat of 
the powerful Makkans by the handful of persecuted Muslims. 

A time limit was also announced along with these two prophecies, during 
which they would be brought to fulfilment. The word bid' occurring in the

4 within nine years. Allah's is the command before and after. And 
on that day the believers will rejoice 5 in Allah's help." He helps 
whom He pleases, and He is the Mighty, the Merciful — 6 (it is) 
Allah's promise! Allah will not fail in His promise, but most 
people do not know. 

7 They know the outward of this world's life, but of the Here- 
after they are heedless. 8 Do they not reflect within themselves? 
Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is 
between them but with truth, and (for) an appointed term. And 
surely most of the people are deniers of the meeting with their 
Lord. 9 Have they not travelled in the earth and seen what was the 
end of those before them? They were stronger than these in prow- 
ess, and dug up the earth, and built on it more than these have 
built. And their messengers came to them with clear arguments. 
So it was not Allah, Who wronged them, but they wronged them- 
selves. 10 Then evil was the end of those who did evil, because they 
rejected the messages of Allah and mocked at them. 



beginning of the next verse means from three to nine years, according to the best 
authorities. It was exactly within nine years, in 624 C.E., that the tables were 
turned against the powerful Persian Empire, the same being the year in which the 
mighty Quraish suffered a defeat at the hands of the helpless Muslims at Badr. "In 
624 he (Heraclius) advanced into northern Media, where he destroyed the great 
fire-temple of Goudzak" (ibid). In the same year, 313 Muslims, many of whom 
were raw, inexperienced youths without any arms, routed a strong force of about a 
thousand of the Quraish warriors, killing all the leaders and dealing a death-blow 
to the power of the enemy. The successes of the Muslim army, on the one hand, 
and of the Romans, on the other, continued until the Quraish were utterly crushed 
by the conquest of Makkah in 630, while "the Persian Empire, from the apparent 
greatness which it had reached ten years ago, sank into hopeless anarchy" (ibid). 

a (5) The help of Allah is the help that was over and over again promised to 
the believers against the idolatrous Makkans. Thus we have here a clear prophecy 
of the victory of the Muslims over the Makkans within nine years from the pro- 
nouncement of the prophecy. It was fulfilled in the battle of Badr. 

b (9) The digging of the earth includes its ploughing for cultivation, its 
digging for minerals and the making of aqueducts, as also the laying of the foun- 
dations of buildings. 



30 : 11 • THE TWO PARTIES 503 

Section 2: The Two Parties 

11 Allah originates the creation, then reproduces it, then to 
Him you will be returned. 12 And the day when the Hour comes, 
the guilty will despair. 13 And they will have no intercessors from 
among their associate-gods, and they will deny their associate- 
gods. 14 And the day when the Hour comes, that day they will be 
separated one from the other. 15 Then as to those who believed and 
did good, they will be made happy in a garden. 16 And as for those 
who disbelieved and rejected Our messages and the meeting of the 
Hereafter, they will be brought to punishment. 

17 So glory be to Allah when you enter the evening and when 
you enter the morning. 18 And to Him be praise in the heavens and 
the earth, and in the afternoon, and when the sun declines. 19 He 
brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead 
from the living, and gives life to the earth after its death. And thus 
will you be brought forth. 6 

Section 3: Manifestations of Divine Power in Nature 

20 And of His signs is this, that He created you from dust, 
then lo! you are mortals who disperse. 21 And of His signs is this, 
that He created mates for you from yourselves that you might find 
quiet of mind in them, and He put between you love and com- 
passion. c Surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect. 



a (18) The five times of prayer are clearly indicated in this and the previous 
verse, the evening prayer comprising both the prayer at sunset and the later eve- 
ning prayer. The five times of prayer were observed at Makkah, and places at 
which the Muslims gathered for prayers are mentioned in reports relating to very 
early days of the Prophet's mission. 

b (19) This clearly points to the rising of a great nation from the Arabs, who 
were spiritually as well as intellectually dead. 

c (21) The close relation between the male and the female (i.e., husband and 
wife) is expressed here. These words do not imply the act of the physical creation 
of the female from the male. The Quran explains itself when it refers to the ties of 
love and compassion, and to the quietness of mind which a married person finds 
in his spouse. The verse gives us the Islamic ideal of marriage which serves the 
purpose not only of the increase of the human race but also that of the spiritual

22 And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and 
the diversity of your tongues and colours. Surely there are signs in 
this for the learned. 23 And of His signs is your sleep by night and 
by day and your seeking of His bounty. Surely there are signs in 
this for a people who would hear. 24 And of His signs is this, that 
He shows you the lightning for fear and for hope, and sends down 
water from the cloud, then gives life with it to the earth after its 
death. Surely there are signs in this for a people who understand. 
25 And of His signs is this, that the heaven and the earth subsist by 
His command. Then when He calls you, from the earth, you come 
forth. 

26 And His is whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. All 
are obedient to Him. 27 And He it is Who originates the creation, 
then reproduces it, and it is very easy to Him. And His is the most 
exalted state in the heavens and the earth; and He is the Mighty, 
the Wise. 

Section 4: Appeal to Human Nature 

28 He sets forth to you a parable about yourselves. Do you 
have, among those whom your right hands possess, partners in 
what We have given you, so that you are equal in it, you fearing 
them as you fear each other?" Thus do We make the messages 
clear for a people who understand. 29 But those who are unjust 
follow their low desires without any knowledge; so who can guide 
him whom Allah leaves in error? And they shall have no helpers. 

30 So set yourself for religion, being upright, the nature made 
by Allah in which He has created mankind. There is no altering 
Allah's creation. That is the right religion — but most people do 
not know — 31 turning to Him; and keep your duty to Him, and 

advancement of both the man and the woman by referring to the quietness of 
mind which they find in each other. 

a (28) The owner and the owned are not equal. So the objects which they 
worshipped from among God's creation cannot be equal to the Creator, Who is 
the Intelligent Cause and Controller of all. 

b (30) Islam according to this verse is the natural religion of mankind, or a 



30 : 32 • APPEAL TO HUMAN NATURE 505 

keep up prayer and do not be of those who set up partners (with 
Allah), 32 of those who split up their religion and become sects; 
each faction rejoicing in what it has. 

33 And when harm afflicts people, they call upon their Lord, 
turning to Him, then when He makes them taste of mercy from 
Him, lo! some of them begin to set up partners with their Lord, 
34 so as to be ungrateful for what We have given them. So enjoy 
yourselves a while — you will soon come to know. 35 0r, have We 
sent to them an authority so that it speaks of what they set up as 
partners with Him? " 36 And when We make people taste of mercy 
they rejoice in it, and if an evil befall them for what their hands 
have already done, lo! they despair. 37 Do they not see that Allah 
amplifies provision for whom He pleases, and restricts (it also)? 
Certainly there are signs in this for a people who believe. 

38 So give to the near of kin his due, and to the needy and the 
traveller. This is best for those who desire Allah's pleasure, and 
these it is who are successful. 39 And whatever you lay out at 
usury, so that it may increase through the property of (other) 
people, it does not increase with Allah; and whatever you give in 
charity, desiring Allah's pleasure — these will get manifold/ 



religion to the truth of which human nature bears testimony. Its fundamental prin- 
ciples, the Unity and all-comprehensive providence of Allah, the universality of 
Divine revelation, and the accountability for all actions in a life after death, are 
recognized by all religions and all nations, and their universal acceptance is a 
clear evidence that it is the very nature of man that bears testimony to their truth. 
Islam removes all limitations upon these three fundamental doctrines of the reli- 
gion of humanity, and gives them as wide a significance as humanity itself. The 
other fundamental principle of the natural religion of man is mentioned in v. 38. 

a (35) No prophet can be shown to have received a revelation setting up 
creatures on an equal or co-operative plane with the Creator. Every such doctrine, 
besides being against the testimony of human nature and reason, stands con- 
demned because of the absence of any revelation in its support. 

b (38) Charity to fellow man is the practical outcome of the doctrine of the 
brotherhood of humanity, which is one of the two principles of the natural religion 
of mankind. 

c (39) This verse lays stress upon the doctrine of charity to one's fellow- 
man. It says that some people seek to increase their wealth by means of getting 



506 30. THE ROMANS • 30 : 40 

40 Allah is He Who created you, then He sustains you, then He 
causes you to die, then brings you to life. Is there any of your 
associate-gods who does any of it? Glory be to Him, and 
supremely exalted is He above what they set up as partners (with 
Him)! 

Section 5: A Transformation 

41 Corruption has appeared in the land and the sea on account 
of what man's hands have earned, that He may make them taste 
(the consequences of) some of what they have done, so that they 
may turn back. a 42 Say: Travel in the earth, then see what was the 
end of those before! Most of them set up partners (with Allah). 
43 Then set yourself to the right religion before the day comes from 
Allah which cannot be averted: on that day they will be separated. 

interest on money, i.e., they seek an increase of their wealth at the expense of 
other people's property; but that a Muslim should seek an increase of his wealth 
by giving it, for the sake of Allah, to help his fellow-man. 

a (41) History bears evidence to the truth of these words. Before the advent 
of the Holy Prophet corruption and darkness prevailed in all countries of the world, 
affecting the beliefs of people as well as their deeds. Religions had long ceased to 
have any healthy effect on the lives of their votaries, and their followers had not 
only ceased to practise virtue, but, worst of all, they had begun to look upon vice 
as virtue, and many of them attributed indecent and immoral practices to their 
sages and their gods. Such widespread corruption had never previously existed in 
the world's history. J.H. Denison writes in Emotion as the Basis of Civilization: 
"In the fifth and sixth centuries, the civilized world stood on the verge of chaos. 
The old emotional cultures that had made civilization possible . . . had broken down, 
and nothing had been found adequate to take their place. ... It seemed then that the 
great civilization which it had taken four thousand years to construct was on the 
verge of disintegration, and that mankind was likely to return to that condition of 
barbarism where every tribe and sect was against the next and law and order were 
unknown.... Civilization like a gigantic tree whose foliage had over-reached the 
world ... stood tottering ... rotting to the core" (pp. 265-268). And then adds, 
speaking of Arabia: "It was among these people that the man was born who was 
to unite the whole known world of the east and south" (p. 269). 

With the light of Islam, and through the torch of knowledge and civilization 
lit in Arabia, a new era dawned not only over Arabia, but also over other coun- 
tries. Europe remained the longest in darkness, and it was only after the torch of 
knowledge had been lighted in Spain by Muslims that both the Renaissance and 
the Reformation came. 



30 : 44 • A TRANSFORMATION 507 

44 Whoever disbelieves will be responsible for his disbelief; and 
whoever does good, such prepare (good) for their own souls, 45 that 
He may reward out of His grace those who believe and do good. 
Surely He does not love the disbelievers. 

46 And of His signs is this, that He sends forth the winds 
bearing good news, and that He may make you taste of His mercy, 
and that the ships may glide by His command, and that you may 
seek of His grace, and that you may be grateful." 47 And certainly 
We sent before you messengers to their people, so they came to 
them with clear arguments, then We punished those who were 
guilty. And to help believers is ever incumbent on Us. 48 Allah is 
He Who sends forth the winds, so they raise a cloud, then He 
spreads it forth in the sky as He pleases, and He breaks it, so that 
you see the rain coming forth from inside it; then when He causes 
it to fall upon whom He pleases of His servants, lo! they rejoice 
— 49 though they were before this, before it was sent down upon 
them, in sure despair. 

50 Look then at the signs of Allah's mercy, how He gives life 
to the earth after its death. Surely He is the Giver of life to the 
dead; and He is Powerful over all things. 51 And if We send a wind 
and they see it yellow, they would after that certainly continue to 
disbelieve. 52 So surely you cannot make the dead to hear, nor can 
you make the deaf to hear the call, when they turn back retreating. 
53 Nor can you guide the blind out of their error. Fou can make 
none to hear but those who believe in Our messages, so they 
submit. 



a (46) The verse calls attention to the change that was already coming over 
the peninsula; this was a clear indication of the mighty transformation that was ulti- 
mately to be brought about. 

b (51) It, in this verse, refers to the seed-produce, which is meant by the 
expression "gives life to the earth" in the previous verse; the meaning is, the seed- 
produce may be rendered yellow or caused to wither away by a blast of the wind. 
The allusion is to the disasters which would strike a blow at the disbelievers' plans. 
It also refers to their persistence in disbelief, in spite of the afflictions which they 
experience.

Section 6: Overthrow of Opposition 

54 Allah is He Who created you from a state of weakness, 
then He gave strength after weakness, then ordained weakness and 
grey hair after strength." He creates what He pleases, and He is the 
Knowing, the Powerful. 55 And the day when the Hour comes, the 
guilty will swear: They did not remain but an hour. Thus are they 
ever turned away (from truth). 56 And those who are given know- 
ledge and faith will say: Certainly you remained according to the 
ordinance of Allah till the day of Resurrection — so this is the day 
of Resurrection — but you did not know. 57 So that day their 
excuse will not benefit those who were unjust, nor will they be 
granted goodwill. 

58 And certainly We have set forth for people in this Quran 
every kind of description. And if you bring them a sign, those who 
disbelieve would certainly say: You are only deceivers. 59 Thus 
does Allah seal the hearts of those who do not know.* 60 So be 
patient; surely the promise of Allah is true; and let not those 
disquiet you who have no certainty. 



a (54) There is a deeper reference here to the law of the rise, growth and 
decay of nations. 

b (59) Allah's sealing the hearts thus really means their own persistence in 
disbelief and wickedness, as the preceding verse shows. 



Chapter 3 1 

Luqman Luqmail 

The name of this chapter is taken from that of the Ethiopian sage, Luqman, to 
whose story it refers. It deals with the following topics: success to be attained 
by the Muslims, wise advice of Luqman to his son, now meant for Muslims, 
greatness of Divine power, and the doom of the mighty opponents of truth. 
Chapters 29 to 32 form one group revealed near the close of the early period 
at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Believers will be Successful 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Best Knower." 2 These are the verses of the 
Book of Wisdom — 3 a guidance and a mercy for the doers of 
good, 4 who keep up prayer and give the due charity and who are 
certain of the Hereafter. 5 These are on a guidance from their Lord, 
and these are they who are successful. 

6 And among people is he who takes, instead, frivolous 
discourse to lead astray from Allah's path without knowledge, and 
to make it a mockery. For such is a humiliating punishment. 
7 And when Our messages are recited to him, he turns back proud- 
ly, as if he had not heard them, as if there were deafness in his 
ears; so announce to him a painful punishment. 8 Those who 
believe and do good, for them are Gardens of bliss, 9 to abide 
therein. A promise of Allah in truth! And He is the Mighty, the 
Wise. 

10 He created the heavens without pillars that you can see, 
and cast mountains on the earth in case it should quake with you, e 



a (1) For explanation, see 2:1 footnote. 

b (6) It is a mistake to think that a particular person is meant here. The state- 
ment is general and applies to all those who take the Quran for a mockery.

510 31.LUQMAN -31:11 

and He spread on it animals of every kind. And We send down 
water from the clouds, then cause to grow in it (vegetation) of 
every noble kind. 11 This is Allah's creation; now show Me what 
those besides Him have created. No, the unjust are in manifest 
error. 

Section 2: Luqman's Advice to his Son 

12 And certainly We gave Luqman wisdom, a saying: Give 
thanks to Allah. And whoever is thankful, is thankful for the good 
of his own soul; and whoever denies, then surely Allah is Self- 
Sufficient, Praised. 13 And when Luqman said to his son, while he 
instructed him: My son, set up no partner with Allah. Surely 
setting up partners (with Him) is a grievous wrong. 14 And We 
have enjoined on man concerning his parents — his mother bears 
him with faintings upon faintings and his weaning takes two years 
— saying: Give thanks to Me and to your parents. To Me is the 
eventual coming. b 15 And if they strive to make you set up partners 
with Me, of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them/ 
and keep kindly company with them in this world, and follow the 
way of him who turns to Me; then to Me is your return, then I 
shall inform you of what you did. 

16 My son, even if it is the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, 
even though it were in a rock, or in the heaven or in the earth, 
Allah will bring it forth. Surely Allah is Knower of subtleties, 
Aware. 17 My son, keep up prayer and enjoin good and forbid evil, 



a (12) From what is stated of him, Luqman seems to have been an Ethiopian. 
It is very probable that the Greek "^sop" is a corruption of "Ethiopian" and is 
identical with Luqman. The Quran accepts many prophets besides those men- 
tioned in the Bible. 

b (14) Verses 14 and 15 are parenthetical, enjoining the duty of obedience to 
parents, because it is a parent who is advising his son. 

c (15) Despite the great stress that the Quran lays on the duty of obedience to 
parents, it also warns against attaching undue importance to that duty when the 
same clashes with a still higher duty, namely, duty to one's Maker. In fact any 
duty, however great, must be sacrificed before a higher duty, and one's duty to 
one's Maker is the highest of all duties. 



31:18' GREATNESS OF DIVINE POWER 5 1 1 

and bear patiently whatever befalls you. Surely this is a matter of 
great resolution. 18 And do not turn your face away from people in 
contempt, nor go about in the land exultingly. Surely Allah does 
not love any self-conceited boaster. 19 And pursue the right course 
in jour going about and lower jour voice. Surely the most hateful 
of voices is braying of donkeys." 

Section 3: Greatness of Divine Power 

20 Do you not see that Allah has made subservient to you 
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and 
granted to you His favours complete outwardly and inwardly? 
And some people dispute about Allah without knowledge or 
guidance or a Book giving light.* 21 And when it is said to them, 
Follow what Allah has revealed, they say: No, we follow that 
(path) upon which we found our fathers. What! Though the devil 
calls them to the punishment of the burning Fire! 

22 And whoever submits himself to Allah and does good (to 
others), he indeed takes hold of the firmest handle. And Allah's is 
the end of (all) matters. 23 And whoever disbelieves, do not let his 
disbelief grieve you. To Us is their return, then We shall inform 
them of what they did. Surely Allah is Knower of what they did. 
Surely Allah is Knower of what is in the hearts. 24 We give them to 
enjoy a little, then We shall drive them to a severe punishment. 
25 And if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they 
will say: Allah. Say: Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not 
know. 26 To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the 
earth. Surely Allah is the Self-Sufficient, the Praised. 

27 And if all the trees in the earth were pens, and the sea with 
seven more seas added to it (were ink), the words of Allah would 



a (19) Humility and meekness were taught by every prophet. An Ethiopian 
too preached the meekness and humility which was preached by Jesus. 

b (20) The words are meant as well for Muslims. So long as they adhered to 
the Book giving light they continued to advance in the world, and they will again 
lead the world when they place the Book giving light in the forefront. 



512 31.LUQMAN -31:28 

not be exhausted. Surely Allah is Mighty, Wise. a 28 Your creation 
or your raising is only like a single soul. Surely Allah is Hearing, 
Seeing. 29 Do you not see that Allah makes the night to pass into 
the day, and He makes the day to pass into the night, and He has 
made the sun and the moon subservient (to you) — each pursues 
its course till an appointed time — and that Allah is Aware of 
what you do? 30 This is because Allah is the Truth, and what they 
call upon besides Him is falsehood, and that Allah is the High, the 
Great. 

Section 4: The Doom comes 

31 Do you not see that the ships glide on the sea by Allah's 
grace, that He may show you of His signs? Surely there are signs 
in this for every patient, grateful one.* 32 And when a wave like 
awnings covers them, they call upon Allah, being sincere to Him 
in obedience. But when He brings them safe to land, some of them 
follow the middle course. And none denies Our signs but every 
perfidious, ungrateful one. 

33 O people, keep your duty to your Lord and dread the day 
when no father can avail his son in the least, nor will the child 
avail his father. Surely the promise of Allah is true, so do not let 
this world's life deceive you, nor let the arch-deceiver deceive you 
about Allah.' 34 Surely Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge 
of the Hour, and He sends down the rain, and He knows what is in 
the wombs. And no one knows what he will earn tomorrow. And 



a (27) It is noteworthy that a man who himself could not use the pen and 
who lived in a country where pen and ink were scarce, expresses such an idea of 
the abundance of pens and ink. While containing a prophetic allusion to the abun- 
dant use of pen and ink in the world, the words are expressive of the unimaginable 
vastness of the Creation of God, for everything created is a word of God in the 
sense that it is created by Divine commandment. 

b (31) The signs for the patient, grateful one no doubt contain a hint to the 
suffering but grateful Muslims, and to their being made a great nation. 

c (33) Gharur, which literally means the great deceiver, stands for the devil. 



31:34- THE DOOM COMES 513 

no one knows in what land he will die." Surely Allah is Knowing, 
Aware. 



a (34) By the Hour is meant the hour of the fulfilment of prophecy and of 
the downfall of the opponents, as well as the Resurrection. The wonderful dis- 
closure of knowledge relating to the future could not be made by a mere mortal, 
who cannot foretell the ordinary events of life happening before his eyes day and 
night. But there may also be a deeper reference to the transformation that was to 
be brought about in Arabia: the sending down of rain signifying the quickening of 
the spiritually dead; those that were in the wombs were ordained to be Muslims; 
the opponents of today would prove the supporters of tomorrow; and those who 
turned the Muslims out of their houses would themselves meet death, when away 
from their habitations, even as they did when they attacked Madinah to crush the 
Muslims. 



Chapter 32 
Aisajdah Adoration 

The name of this chapter is taken from v. 15 where the faithful are spoken of 
as falling down in adoration, or prostrating, when the Divine messages are 
recited to them. The chapter foretells the establishment of Islam, the punish- 
ment for the opponents in this very life and the raising of the dead earth to 
life. Chapters 29 to 32 form one group revealed near the close of the early 
period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Islam will be established 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 1, Allah, am the Best Knower." 2 The revelation of the Book, 
in which there is no doubt, is from the Lord of the worlds. 3 Or do 
they say: He has forged it? No, it is the Truth from your Lord that 
you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you 
that they may walk aright.* 

4 Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and all 
that is between them in six periods, and He is established on the 
Throne of Power. You have not besides Him a guardian or an 
intercessor. Will you not then be mindful? 5 He orders the Affair 
from the heaven to the earth; then it will ascend to Him in a day 
the measure of which is a thousand years as you count. c 6 Such is 



a (1) For explanation, see 2:1 footnote. 

b (3) Makkah had not seen a prophet before the advent of the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad, who was the only Prophet raised among the descendants of Ishmael. 

c (5) Al-Amr or the Affair is the Affair of Islam, and its ordering or regula- 
tion from heaven to earth means that it comes from heaven and will be established 
firmly on earth. Then we are told that it will ascend to God in a day, the measure 
of which is a thousand years according to human reckoning, which means that it 
will receive a set-back for a thousand years. As regards the period of its firmness, 
we are told by the Holy Prophet Muhammad that it will retain its purity for three 
centuries: "The best of the generations is my generation, then those who follow 



514 



32:7* ISLAM WILL BE ESTABLISHED 5 1 5 

the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Mighty, the Merciful, 
7 Who made beautiful everything that He created, and He began 
the creation of man from dust. a "Then He made his progeny of an 
extract, of worthless seeming water. 'Then He made him complete 
and breathed into him of His spirit, and gave you ears and eyes 
and hearts; little thanks you give! 

10 And they say: When we are lost in the earth, shall we then 
be in a new creation? Indeed, they are disbelievers in the meeting 
with their Lord. n Say: The angel of death, who is given charge of 
you, will cause you to die, then to your Lord you will be returned. 

Section 2: Believers and Disbelievers — a Comparison 

12 And if only you could see when the guilty hang their heads 
before their Lord: Our Lord, we have seen and heard, so send us 



them, then those who follow them, then after them will come people who will 
pride themselves in abundance of wealth and love plumpness" (Tirmidhi, 31:39). 
That there is a prophecy here is shown by the next verse, which says, Such is the 
Knower of the unseen and the seen. This prophecy was made known at a time 
when there was not the least indication that Islam would be established in the 
earth. At that time the Prophet was told that Islam would be firmly established at 
first. That the cause would go on advancing for three centuries is made clear by 
the Prophet's saying. After that the cause of Islam would be chequered and it 
would have its set-backs, which would continue for a thousand years. The limita- 
tion of the period of chequering shows clearly that, after that, the advancement of 
Islam will again be unhampered. 

a (7) See 23:12-14, where the various stages through which man passes in 
his creation are spoken of in detail. The wonderful beauty of creation from the 
atom to the most brilliant star in the realm of matter, and from the smallest ant to 
the most developed form of life in man, could not have been known to an 
Arabian of the 7th century who could neither read nor write, yet he sees, as stated 
here, that everything that was created was beautiful. This beauty in creation 
undoubtedly emanated from the same Source, from the Great Creator Who, 
according to the Quran, has the "most beautiful names" (17: 110, 20:8, 59:24). 

b (9) This verse shows that the spirit of God is breathed into every human 
being. This points to a mystical relation between human nature and Divine nature. 
It is due to this spirit Divine that he rules the creation and it is due to the same 
Divine spirit in him that he receives a new life after death — a life in which he 
lives in God and with God — the meeting with God or liqd Allah, as it is called in 
v. 10. 



516 32. THE ADORATION • 32 : 1 3 

back, we will do good; we are (now) certain. 13 And if We had 
pleased, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word 
from Me was just: I will certainly fill hell with jinn and people, all 
together." 14 So taste, because you forgot the meeting of this Day 
of yours; surely We forsake you; and taste the abiding punishment 
for what you did. 

15 Only they believe in Our messages who, when they are 
reminded of them, fall down prostrate and celebrate the praise of 
their Lord, and they are not proud. 16 They forsake (their) beds, 
calling upon their Lord in fear and in hope, and spend (on good 
works) out of what We have given them. 17 So no soul knows 
what joy of the eyes is hidden for them: a reward for what they 
did/' 

18 Is he then, who is a believer, like him who is a trans- 
gressor? They are not equal. 19 As for those who believe and do 
good deeds, for them are Gardens, a refuge — an entertainment 
for what they did. 20 And as for those who transgress, their refuge 
is the Fire. Whenever they desire to go forth from it, they are 



a (13) God's word, as the Quran says so often, is that the right way has been 
pointed out to man but he is given the choice to accept or reject it, and that those 
who rejected that word and did not forsake evil ways would go to hell. The 
reference in if We had pleased is to the fact that man is not compelled to submit to 
the Divine law. His superiority lies in the fact that he has been given a choice. If 
he exercises that choice rightly, he attains to eminence; if he exercises it wrongly, 
he must taste the evil consequences of his deeds. 

b (16) The literal significance of the original words for they forsake is their 
sides draw away from, showing that they are restless in their beds. These are the 
foundations of the culture of Islam, passing part of the night in remembering Allah, 
and passing the day in earning wealth to spend in the way of Allah for the benefit 
of humanity. 

c (17) This is a true description of what the blessings of paradise are: No 
soul knows what joy of the eyes is hidden for them. These blessings are hidden from 
the physical eye of man, and therefore their description in words which convey an 
idea of the blessings of this life is metaphorical. Words cannot reveal to us the 
real nature of those blessings. The Holy Prophet's own comment on these words 
shows this, for he is reported to have said: "Allah says, I have prepared for My 
righteous servants that which no eye has seen and no ear has heard, and which the 
heart of man cannot conceive" (Bukhari, 59:8). 



32:21' DEAD EARTH WILL RECEIVE LIFE 5 1 7 

brought back into it, and it is said to them: Taste the punishment 
of the Fire, which you called a lie. 21 And certainly We will make 
them taste the nearer punishment before the greater punishment, 
that perhaps they may turn." 22 And who is more unjust than he 
who is reminded of the messages of his Lord, then he turns away 
from them? Surely We exact retribution from the guilty. 

Section 3: Dead Earth will receive Life 

23 And We indeed gave Moses the Book — so do not doubt 
the meeting with Him — and We made it a guide for the Children 
of Israel. 24 And We made from among them leaders to guide by 
Our command when they were patient. And they were certain of 
Our messages. 25 Surely your Lord will judge between them on the 
day of Resurrection in that in which they differed. 26 Is it not clear 
to them, how many of the generations, in whose abodes they go 
about, We destroyed before them? Surely there are signs in this. 
Will they not then hear? 27 Do they not see that We drive the water 
to a land having no vegetation, then We bring forth with it seed- 
produce, of which their cattle and they themselves eat. Will they 
not then see? 

28 And they say: When will this victory come, if you are 
truthful? e 29 Say: On the day of victory the faith of those who 



a (21) By the nearer punishment is meant the earthly punishment, which 
might serve as a warning against the greater punishment of the Hereafter. The 
opponents of Truth are thus told that they must taste a punishment in this life, too, 
and the description of it given in the previous verse — whenever they desire to go 
forth from it, they are brought back into it — manifestly applies to modern world 
conditions, when materialism has taken hold of the minds of people. The wars 
raging in the world are the fire of this life, and, however much the warring nations 
may desire to get out of them, they are brought back into them. 

b (23) To bring about the meeting with God — to make humans live in God 
— is the real aim of religion, and here it is pointed out that to make people attain 
this object a Book was given to Moses for the Israelites, as a Book is now given 
for the whole world. This object will be attained despite opposition, which will be 
brought to naught, as made clear in v. 26. 

c (28) The question makes it clear that the above verses speak of the triumph 
of Islam over all opposition, then and now, in metaphorical language; hence they

ask, when will the victory come? The driving of the water to a dead land, a land 
having no vegetation, is a clear hint that the dead earth will receive life. 



Chapter 33 
Ai-Ahzab The Allies 

By the Allies are meant the Quraish, allied with other idolatrous tribes and 
tribes of the Jews, who besieged Madinah in 4 A.H. That battle is known as 
the battle of the Allies, and this chapter deals with it. It begins by referring to 
the spiritual relationship of the Holy Prophet Muhammad with the faithful, and 
then covers the topic of the attack of the Allies on the Muslims. It goes on to 
deal with the Holy Prophet's domestic life and shows that, despite becoming 
a ruler of his people, he and his wives lived in the utmost simplicity and he 
told his wives that to stay with him they would have to give up worldly 
comforts. Then it refutes some objections relating to his domestic life and 
teaches Muslims certain rules of conduct in domestic relations. Finally, it 
denounces those who spread evil reports against innocent persons and teaches 
Muslims to avoid such behaviour. Most of this chapter was revealed in 4 
A.H. while some verses were revealed later, up to 7 A.H. 



Section 1 : Spiritual and Physical Relationship 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O Prophet, keep your duty to Allah and do not obey the 
disbelievers and the hypocrites." Surely Allah is ever Knowing, 
Wise; 2 and follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Surely 
Allah is ever Aware of what you do; 3 and trust in Allah. And Allah 
is enough as having charge (of affairs). 

4 Allah has not made for any man two hearts within him; nor 



a (1) The chapter was revealed at a time when the powerful and combined 
forces of the Arabian tribes threatened Madinah from without and the hypocrites 
and the Jews assisted them from within to crush the Muslims. It was necessary at 
such a critical time that the Muslims, who are really addressed here through the 
Prophet, should not in any way be compliant to their deadly enemies. Or, the 
meaning is that the Holy Prophet should not be troubled by his critics, for their 
object was only to carp, and one course of action was as well calculated to give 
them occasion for carping as another. 

b (4-1) This passage does not relate to what follows but sums up what is said 



519 



520 33. THE ALLIES • 33 : 5 

has He made your wives whom you desert by Zihar, your mothers, 
nor has He made those whom you assert (to be your sons) your 
sons. These are the words of your mouths. And Allah speaks the 
truth and He shows the way." 5 Call them by (the names of) their 
fathers; this is more equitable with Allah; but if you do not know 
their fathers, then they are your brethren in faith and your friends. 
And there is no blame on you in that about which you make a 
mistake, but (you are answerable for) what your hearts intend. 
And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 6 The Prophet is closer to 
the faithful than their own selves, and his wives are (as) their 
mothers.' And the possessors of relationship are closer to one 
another in the ordinance of Allah than (other) believers, and those 
who fled (their homes), except that you do some good to your 
friends. c This is written in the Book. 



in the previous verse. The Prophet is there told not to be compliant to the 
disbelievers and the hypocrites, but to trust in Allah alone, because the same heart 
cannot simultaneously entertain love for Allah and love for His enemies. 

a (4-2) This passage abolishes two ignorant customs of pre-Islamic times. 
The first of these was called zihar which consisted in a man saying to his wife you 
are to me as the back of my mother. No sooner were the words pronounced than 
the relation between husband and wife ended as by a divorce, but the woman was 
not at liberty to leave the husband's house and marry elsewhere. She remained in 
the same house, as a deserted wife. The other custom was that of regarding the 
adopted son as if he were a real son. This passage abolishes both customs on the 
same ground; a wife cannot be a real mother, nor a stranger a real son. The subject 
of zihar is fully discussed in the first section of chapter 58. 

b (6-1) The Prophet was indeed much more than a father to the believers. He 
had raised them to the dignity of manhood from a state of savagery, consequently 
the tie of love which united them to him was stronger than the ordinary ties of 
love and friendship. The statement that his wives are their mothers has reference 
to spiritual relationship, because they were helpful in bringing up the faithful 
spiritually; see v. 33 and 34. 

c (6-2) When the Muslims first came to Madinah, a brotherhood was estab- 
lished between those who fled and the helpers, one of the former becoming a 
brother of one of the latter, and each of the two thus united was entitled to a share 
of inheritance on the death of the other, according to an old Arab custom. The 
passage abolishes this custom, maintaining only the brotherhood of Islam in a 
wider sense, and allowing inheritance only to actual relatives. But a Muslim could 
assist his brother in Islam by a gift or by making a will in his favour. This is the 
significance of the words except that you do some good to your friends. 



33:7* THE ALLIES' ATTACK ON MADINAH 521 

7 And when We took a covenant from the prophets and from 
you, and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus, son of 
Mary, and We took from them a solemn covenant," 8 that He may 
question the truthful of their truth, and He has prepared for the 
disbelievers a painful punishment. 

Section 2: The Allies' Attack on Madinah 

9 O you who believe, call to mind the favour of Allah to you 
when armies came against you,* so We sent against them a strong 
wind and forces that you did not see. e And Allah is ever Seer of 
what you do. 10 When they came upon you from above you and 
from below you, and when the eyes turned dull and the hearts 
rose up to the throats, and you began to think diverse thoughts 
about Allah. 8 11 There were the believers tried and they were 
shaken with a severe shaking. 



a (7) The covenant referred to here may be in relation to the delivery of the 
message with which the prophets are entrusted. But see 3:81, which speaks of a 
covenant with the prophets with regard to the advent of the Holy Prophet. The 
covenant spoken of as having been made with the Holy Prophet evidently refers to 
the Prophet's verifying all previous revelation. Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus 
are specially mentioned by name on account of their importance. 

b (9-1) The events narrated here relate to the siege of Madinah by the com- 
bined forces of the Quraish and their allies, aided by the Jewish tribe of the Bani 
Nadir and the Bani Quraizah, the latter of whom had made a treaty of alliance 
with the Muslims — the entire forces numbering from ten to twenty thousand 
according to different versions, while the Muslims were only about thirteen or 
fourteen hundred. The Prophet decided to remain within the town and a ditch was 
dug as a protective measure against the onrush of the powerful force. The battle 
continued for several days, the enemy eventually taking to flight on a stormy 
night without being able to inflict any loss upon the Muslims. 

c (9-2) A great hurricane caused the enemy to flee. The forces which could 
not be seen were the angelic hosts which disheartened the enemy. The angelic 
assistance is promised in 3:125. 

d (10-1) One allied tribe pitched on the east side of the town, on the higher 
part of the valley, and the Quraish on the west side, on the lower part. 

e (10-2) The description of the eyes and the hearts indicates the natural 
Muslim fear. The diverse thoughts signify the fears of the weak-hearted and the 
hypocrites that Allah's promise would not prove true and that the enemy would 
destroy them. As regards the thoughts of the faithful, see v. 22. 



522 33. THE ALLIES • 33 : 12 

12 And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a 
disease began to say: Allah and His Messenger promised us (victory) 
only to deceive. a 13 And when a group of them said: People of 
Yathrib, you cannot make a stand, so go back. c And a party of 
them asked permission of the Prophet, saying, Our houses are 
exposed. And they were not exposed. They only desired to run 
away. 14 And if an entry were made upon them from the outlying 
parts of it, then they were asked to wage war (against the Muslims), 
they would certainly have done it, and they would not have stayed 
in it but a little while. 15 And they had indeed made a covenant 
with Allah before, (that) they would not turn (their) backs. And a 
covenant with Allah must be answered for. 

16 Say: Running away will not benefit you, if you run away 
from death or slaughter, and then you will not be allowed to enjoy 
yourselves but a little. 17 Say: Who is it that can protect you from 
Allah, if He intends harm for you or He intends to show you 
mercy? And they will not find for themselves a guardian or a 
helper besides Allah. 18 Allah indeed knows those among you who 
hinder others and those who say to their brethren, Come to us. 
And they do not come to the fight but a little, 19 being miserly with 
regard to you. But when fear comes, you will see them looking to 
you, their eyes rolling like one fainting because of death. But when 
fear is gone they strike you with sharp tongues, being greedy for 



a (12) There was an unmistakable promise of victory, but the circumstances 
were decidedly against the fulfilment of that promise, and hence the weak-hearted 
said that the promise of victory was given only to deceive them. 

b (13-1) Yathrib was the name by which Madinah was known before the 
Prophet's flight to that city. On the Prophet's flight there, it received the name of 
Madinat al-Nabi or the City of the Prophet, or simply Madinah. 

c (13-2) That is, go back to idolatry to save your lives, or make a retreat and 
return to your houses. 

d (14) These verses describe the condition of the hypocrites, who advanced 
excuses for not fighting against the opponents of the Muslims. If an enemy had 
entered into the city from another side and invited them to join hands with him to 
fight against the Muslims, they would have been ready to fight. The concluding 
words show that they would have even left Madinah to attack the Muslims and 
would not then have cared for the protection of their houses.

wealth. These have not believed, so Allah makes their deeds 
fruitless. And that is easy for Allah. 20 They think the allies are not 
gone, and if the allies should come (again), they would wish to be 
in the deserts with the dwellers of the desert, asking for news 
about you. And if they were among you, they would not fight but 
a little. 

Section 3: Allies' Flight 

21 Certainly you have in the Messenger of Allah an excellent 
exemplar for him who hopes in Allah and the Last Day, and 
remembers Allah much. a 22 And when the believers saw the allies, 
they said: This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us, and 
Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. And it only added to 
their faith and submission. 23 Among the believers are men who 
are true to the covenant they made with Allah; so some of them 
have accomplished their vow, and some of them yet wait, and they 
have not changed in the least — 24 that Allah may reward the truth- 
ful for their truth, and punish the hypocrites, if He please, or turn 
to them (mercifully). e Surely Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 



a (21) This verse states that the Holy Prophet Muhammad is the best exemp- 
lar and the highest model of virtue for the faithful under all circumstances. He 
was a general, soldier, lawmaker, judge, husband and father. He punished tyrants 
for wrongs they had inflicted on innocent persons, forgave his persecuting enemies 
after overcoming them, and overlooked the faults of his followers. Hence he was 
an excellent exemplar and a perfect model in all walks of life, and he not only gave 
practical rules of guidance, but gave by his life a practical illustration of all those 
rules. 

The occasion on which his being an exemplar for the faithful is pointed out 
is one on which he showed the greatest firmness in utmost danger, confidence in 
Divine assistance, and steadfastness in the hardest trials, and the believers are told 
that they must not lose heart, but follow the example of the Holy Prophet. 

b (22) The reference here is to the Divine promise that a time would come 
when the combined forces of Arabia would be put to flight. This promise was 
given long before, at a time when the Holy Prophet and his few followers were 
being severely persecuted at Makkah. So when the combined forces attacked 
Madinah, the words of the prophecy were in the heart of every true Muslim. They 
rejoiced because they were certain that the combined forces of the enemy would 
be put to flight. It was only the hypocrites who had misgivings. 

c (24) It is clearly stated here, as also in v. 17, that all the hypocrites would 



524 33. THE ALLIES • 33 : 25 

25 And Allah turned back the disbelievers in their rage — 
they gained no advantage. And Allah was sufficient for the 
believers in fighting. And Allah is ever Strong, Mighty. 26 And He 
drove down those of the People of the Book who backed them 
from their fortresses and He cast awe into their hearts; some you 
killed and you took captive some. a 27 And He made you heirs to 
their land and their dwellings and their property, and (to) a land 
which you have not yet trodden. And Allah is ever Powerful over 
all things. 

Section 4: Prophet's Domestic Simplicity 

28 O Prophet, say to your wives: If you desire this world's life 
and its adornment, come, I will give you a provision and allow you 
to depart in a gracious manner. c 29 And if you desire Allah and His 



not be punished, but that Allah would be merciful to them, punishing only such as 
deserved to be punished. Thus it happened that most of them became afterwards 
sincere converts to Islam. 

a (26) The Jewish tribe of Bani Quraizah were in alliance with the Holy 
Prophet, and when the enemy laid siege to Madinah they should have repelled the 
attack. Instead of this they sided with the invading army. When the enemy army 
took to flight and the Quraizah returned to their fortress, it was besieged by the 
Holy Prophet. They surrendered by stipulating the condition that they would sub- 
mit to the judgment of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, formerly their ally. The reference here is 
to the punishment awarded by him, in accordance with the Jewish law in Deutero- 
nomy, 20:12-14. 

b (27) The land which you have not yet trodden refers to the foreign lands 
which are here promised to the Muslims and which they conquered later. 

c (28) Muslims were now growing powerful and wealthier. It was natural, in 
the circumstances, that the wives of the Prophet should desire to be furnished with 
better necessities of life than they had previously enjoyed. But just at this time we 
find a revelation enjoining the strictest simplicity upon them. If the Prophet had 
allowed his wives to share in the general prosperity of the community, there could 
not have been the least objection. But he received a revelation which deprived 
him and those most nearly related to him of those material benefits which others 
could easily acquire. The splendours of this world were not forbidden to any 
Muslim, but such transitory vanities were not to be admitted into the household of 
God's Prophet. As he possessed the means, his wives would be allowed to depart 
with rich and ample gifts, if such was their desire. This passage also shows that 
the object of the Prophet's marriages was not sensual enjoyment, for he would not

Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, then surely Allah has 
prepared for the doers of good among you a mighty reward. 
30 O wives of the Prophet, whoever of you is guilty of manifestly 
improper conduct, the punishment will be doubled for her. And 
this is easy for Allah." 

31 And whoever of you is obedient to Allah and His Messen- 
3- ger and does good, We shall give her a double reward, and We 
k&gt; have prepared for her an honourable sustenance. 32 wives of the 
Prophet, you are not like any other women. If you would keep 
your duty, do not be soft in speech, in case he in whose heart is a 
disease yearn; and speak a word of goodness. e 33 And stay in your 
houses and do not display (your beauty) like the displaying of the 
earlier (days of) ignorance; and keep up prayer, and give the due 
charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah only desires to 
take away uncleanness from you, O people of the household, and 
to purify you a (thorough) purifying. 34 And remember what is 

have been ready to sacrifice the ease and comforts attendant upon mere carnal 
desire, and retain the simplicity enjoined upon his household. 

a (30) Not only are the Prophet's wives denied the comforts of life which 
were available to other Muslim women, but any unseemly conduct on their part 
brought double the ordinary punishment. Could this be the work of an impostor? 
In their case the punishment is increased because, being in the Prophet's house, 
they had a better chance to be guided aright and to pass their lives in the greatest 
purity. It should be noted that there is no actual occurrence of the least indecency 
on the part of any of the Prophet's wives. 

b (31) Double reward means only greater reward, as the words honourable 
sustenance show. The greater reward is due to their having denied themselves the 
ordinary comforts of life by remaining in the Prophet's house. 

c (32) The wives of the Prophet are here told that they were not like other 
women, as they had to come in contact with large numbers of people, who would 
come to them to learn the treasures of wisdom which they received from the 
Prophet. An allusion to this is contained in the words: and speak a word of good- 
ness. As a safeguard against possible inclination of the heart to evil thoughts, they 
are told not to indulge in soft and amorous conversation with the opposite sex. It 
is really a rule of life for all Muslim women, and promotes purity of heart and 
chastity in the relations between the sexes. 

d (33) The means of purification are suggested in the preceding text: to 
observe the utmost simplicity of life, to avoid every indecency, and not to display 
their beauty to others. The uncleanness which Allah will thus take away is the

recited in your houses of the messages of Allah and the Wisdom. " 
Surely Allah is ever Knower of subtleties, Aware. 

Section 5: Prophet's Marriage with Zainab 

35 Surely the men who submit and the women who submit, 
and the believing men and the believing women, and the obeying 
men and the obeying women, and the truthful men and the truthful 
women, and the patient men and the patient women, and the

and the men who guard their (own) chastity and the women who

who remember — Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a 
mighty reward. 

36 And it does not befit a believing man or a believing woman, 
when Allah and His Messenger have decided an affair, to exercise 
a choice in their matter. And whoever disobeys Allah and His 
Messenger, he surely strays off to manifest error. c 37 And when you 

uncleanness of the desire for worldly riches. As the Prophet himself was an 
exemplar to the faithful, so was his household to be an example of simplicity and 
purity to Muslim women; hence they are called mothers of the faithful; see v. 6. 

Not only did the wives of the Prophet retain the utmost simplicity of life in 
his lifetime, but even after his death, when the Muslims grew a very wealthy nation 
and big stipends were paid to the Prophet's wives, they did not allow wealth to 
accumulate in their houses but distributed it to deserving people. Of Aishah 
especially it is related that she was so generous in giving away what came to her 
that she would sometimes be left without the means for an evening meal. 

a (34) The wives of the Prophet were not only to serve as models of virtue to 
the faithful, men as well as women, but they were also required to teach the 
precepts of religion to the faithful. Hence they are told that they must remember 
not only the injunctions of the Quran — the messages of Allah — but also the 
wisdom which the Prophet taught by his practice and word, i.e., the Sunna. 

b (35) This verse repeats ten times that women can attain every good quality 
to which men can have access and settles it conclusively that according to the 
Quran women stand on the same spiritual level as men. 

c (36) This refers to the marriage of Zainab, first cousin of the Holy Prophet 
through his paternal aunt, with Zaid, his freed slave and adopted son. Zainab and 
her relations wished for her marriage to the Holy Prophet. But he insisted that she 
marry Zaid. In deference to his wishes, she accepted marriage with Zaid. 



33 : 38 • PROPHET'S MARRIAGE WITH ZAINAB 527 

said to him (Zaid) to whom Allah had shown favour and to whom 
you had shown a favour: Keep your wife to yourself and keep your 
duty to Allah;" and you concealed in your heart what Allah would 
bring to light, and you feared people, while Allah has a greater 
right that you should fear Him. So when Zaid dissolved her 
marriage -tie, We gave her to you as a wife, so that there should be 
no difficulty for the believers about the wives of their adopted 
sons, when they have dissolved their (wives') marriage-tie. And 
Allah's command is ever performed. 

38 There is no harm for the Prophet in what Allah has ordain- 
ed for him. Such has been the way of Allah with those who have 
gone before. And the command of Allah is a decree that is made 
absolute — 39 those who deliver the messages of Allah and fear 
Him, and fear none but Allah. And Allah is sufficient to take account. 



a (37-1) The marriage was not happy and Zaid expressed a desire to the 
Holy Prophet of divorcing Zainab. The news was grieving for the Prophet, for it 
was he who had insisted upon the marriage, and he therefore advised Zaid not to 
divorce her. According to one interpretation, the subsequent words "and you con- 
cealed in your heart" to "Allah has a greater right that you should fear Him" are a 
continuation of the Holy Prophet's advice to Zaid not to divorce Zainab. (Editor's 
Note: In this interpretation, "you feared people" is also said to refer to Zaid's fear 
that, as the social standing of Zainab was much higher than his own, people would 
think he was not giving Zainab sufficient respect.) 

b (37-2) After Zainab was divorced the Holy Prophet took her in marriage, 
that being the wish of the lady and her relatives before her marriage to Zaid, and 
the Prophet was, now that the marriage arranged by him proved unsuccessful, 
morally bound to accept their wishes. Moreover, the Quran had declared against 
an adopted son being regarded as if he were a real son, and now there was an 
opportunity where the Holy Prophet could deal a death-blow to that custom. This 
reason is plainly given in the second part of the verse: so that there should be no 
difficulty for the believers about the wives of their adopted sons. The Quran does 
not give any other reason for the marriage. 

There is a baseless story that the Prophet, having seen Zainab by chance 
through a half-open door, was fascinated by her beauty, and that Zaid, having 
come to know of this, divorced her, and then she became the Prophet's wife. That 
this story is absurd is shown by the admitted facts that the Holy Prophet knew her 
very well before her marriage to Zaid, that he himself insisted on her marrying 
Zaid despite she and her relatives being desirous of her marriage with the Holy 
Prophet, and that he strongly advised Zaid not to divorce her.

rance, 42 and glorify Him morning and evening. 43 He it is Who 
sends blessings on you, and (so do) His angels, that He may bring 



a (40) The word khatam means a seal or the last part or portion of a thing, 
the latter being the primary significance of the word khatim. The words khatam 
al-qaum always means the last of the people — akhiru-hum. Though the Holy 
Prophet was admittedly the last of the prophets, and even history shows that no 
prophet appeared after him in the world, yet the Quran has adopted the word 
khatam and not khatim, because a deeper significance is carried in the phrase Seal 
of the prophets than mere finality. It indicates finality combined with perfection of 
prophethood, along with a continuance among his followers of certain blessings 
of prophethood. He is the Seal of the prophets because with him the object of 
prophethood, the manifestation of Divine will in Laws which should guide 
humanity, was finally accomplished in the revelation of a perfect law in the Holy 
Quran, and he is also the Seal of the prophets because certain favours bestowed 
on prophets were forever to continue among his followers. The office of the 
prophet was only necessary to guide people, either by giving them a law or by 
removing the imperfections of a previously existing law, or by giving certain new 
directions to meet the requirements of the time or place. Hence prophets were 
constantly raised. But through the Holy Prophet a perfect law was given, suiting 
the requirements of all ages and all countries, and this law was guarded against all 
corruption, and the office of the prophet was therefore no more required. But this 
did not mean that the Divine favours bestowed on His chosen servants were to be 
denied to the chosen ones among the Muslims. The highest of these favours is 
Divine inspiration, and it is recognized by Islam that the Divine Being speaks to 
His chosen ones now as He spoke in the past, but such people are not prophets in 
the real sense of the word. According to a most reliable hadith, the Prophet said 
"there will be in my community", i.e., among the Muslims, "men who will be 
spoken to (by God), though they will not be prophets" (Bukhari, 62:6). According 
to another version of the same hadith, such people are given the name muhaddath. 

There is also a saying of the Holy Prophet: Nothing has remained of pro- 
phethood except mubashsharat, i.e., good news. And being asked what was meant 
by mubashsharat, or good news, he said: "True visions" (Bukhari, 91:5). Accord- 
ing to another hadith: "The vision of the believer is one of the forty-six parts of 
prophethood" (Bukhari, 91:4). Prophethood itself has gone, but one of its bless- 
ings remains, and will exist forever among the followers of the Holy Prophet.

ers the good news that they will have great grace from Allah.

49 O you who believe, when you marry believing women, 
then divorce them before you touch them, you have in their case 
no term which you should reckon. But make provision for them 
and let them go in a gracious manner. 50 O Prophet, We have made 



a (43) This section deals with the marriages of the Holy Prophet and fittingly 
opens with a statement showing how he had made God the greatest force in the 
lives of a people who had never known God. Again it was by means of the trans- 
formation wrought by him that his companions were led out of the darkness of 
ignorance. How could it be that the man who purified others was himself impure? 
Could a sensual man, a slave of his passions, turn a nation of idolatrous and igno- 
rant men into a godly people? This argument is then further expanded. 

b (46) The words imply that one who could give light to others and raise 
them from the depth of vice and immorality to the height of purity and perfection 
could not himself be in the darkness of impurity. The Prophet is here spoken of 
first as one bearing witness to lost humanity, to people who had lost all idea of 
God-consciousness, that there is a God. More than that he was a bearer of good 
news to humanity that God still remembered mankind, and that He had sent His 
Prophet to make this fallen humanity rise to spiritual eminence, but he was also a 
warner, and told them that, if they persisted in their evil ways, they would suffer 
evil consequences; thus he was an Inviter to Allah and the Sun of righteousness. 

c (48) In the mention of annoying talk there is a clear reference to the 
carpings of his petty-minded critics, who try to misrepresent the greatest source of 
righteousness which the world has ever witnessed, as an evil. The Prophet is told 
to disregard this annoying talk, as the time would come when the question would 
be asked: how is it that the Prophet illumined the world and opened the flood- 
gates of light to a benighted world, if it was darkness that reigned supreme in his 
own mind? (Editor's Note: "Disregard their annoying talk" also shows that a 
Muslim must not become inflamed by verbal abuse of his religion, and if his reply 
has no effect on the abuser then he should simply ignore the hurtful comments.)

lawful to you your wives whom you have given their dowries," and 
those whom jour right hand possesses, out of those whom Allah 
has given you as prisoners of war, and the daughters of jour 
paternal uncle and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the 
daughters of your maternal uncle and the daughters of jour 
maternal aunts who migrated with you; and a believing woman, if 
she gives herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet desires to marry 
her. (It is) especially for you, not for the believers * — We know 
what We have ordained for them concerning their wives and those 
whom their right hands possess in order that no blame may attach 
to you. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 51 Fou may put off 
(by divorce) whom you please of them, and take to yourself whom 



a (50-1) This revelation came after 4:3, which limits the number of wives a 
man can take under exceptional circumstances to four. The Prophet was, however, 
told that he should not divorce the excess number for this reason. 

The marriages of the Holy Prophet have furnished his critics with the chief 
implement of attack on him. Therefore we give some details about them below. 

(1) Up to the age of 25, the Holy Prophet lived a celibate life, a life of trans- 
cendent purity among a people who prided themselves on loose sexual relations. 
(2) At the age of 25, he married a widow, Khadijah, who was 40 years old, and 
passed all the years of his youth and manhood with her as his only wife till she 
passed away when he reached the age of 50. Then while still at Makkah he married 
Saudah, a widow of advanced age. He also married Aishah, his only virgin wife, 
while still at Makkah, but her marriage was consummated five years afterwards in 
the 2nd year of the Hijra. (3) From the age of 54 to 60, after the emigration to 
Madinah, he contracted several marriages at the same time. The women he 
married were mostly widows of his followers who had been killed in battle or 
otherwise died. Besides these widows whom it fell to his lot to take under his 
protection, the Prophet took three widows of his enemies in marriage, and in each 
case this step led to the union and pacification of a whole tribe. The marriage with 
Zainab has already been mentioned; she was a divorced woman. (4) The last 
period was when war came to an end; a reference to this is contained in v. 52: "It 
is not allowed to you to take wives after this". Thus it will be seen that all these 
marriages of the Prophet were due either to feelings of compassion for the widows 
of his faithful followers or to put a stop to bloodshed and ensure union with some 
tribe. 

b (50-2) The Prophet was specially allowed to retain all his wives when the 
number allowed was brought down to four in the case of other believers. This was 
the only privilege allowed to the Prophet and it is to this that the words, especially 
for you, refer. 



33 : 52 • THE PROPHET'S MARRIAGES 531 

you please. And whom you desire of those whom you had sepa- 
rated provisionally, no blame attaches to you. This is most proper 
so that they may be comforted and they may not grieve, and that 
they should be pleased, all of them, with what you give them." 
And Allah knows what is in your hearts. And Allah is ever Know- 
ing, Forbearing. 52 It is not allowed to you to take wives after this, 
nor to change them for other wives, though their beauty be 
pleasing to you, except those whom your right hand (already) 
possesses. e And Allah is ever Watchful over all things. 

Section 7: Rules of Conduct in Domestic Relations 

53 O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet 
unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its 
cooking to be finished — but when you are invited, enter, and 
when you have taken food, disperse — not seeking to listen to 
talk. Surely this gives the Prophet trouble, but he forbears from 
you, and Allah does not forbear from the truth. And when you ask 
of them any goods, ask of them from behind a curtain. This is 
purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not fitting for you 



a (51) This verse must be read along with verses 28 and 29, where a choice 
is given to the Prophet's wives to remain with him or to depart. A similar choice 
is given here to the Prophet. And when his wives preferred to lead simple lives 
with him rather than seek worldly goods by leaving him, the Prophet was no less 
considerate for their feelings; for despite the choice given to him to retain such of 
his wives as he liked, he did not exercise this choice to the disadvantage of 
anyone of them, but retained them all, as they had chosen to remain with him. A 
reference is, indeed, contained to verses 28 and 29 in the words that they should 
be pleased, all of them, with what you give them, which indicate that this was 
altogether a new arrangement in which both parties were given free choice and 
both sacrificed all other considerations to the sanctity of the marriage-tie. 

b (52-1) When the Prophet's wives chose to remain with him, the limitation 
was placed upon the Holy Prophet that he should not take any other wife nor 
should he divorce anyone of those who had chosen to remain with him. 

c (52-2) By those whom your right hand possesses are indicated the wives of 
the Prophet whom he had lawfully married. 

d (53-1) Any rule of conduct to be observed in relation to the Holy Prophet 
is really a rule that must be observed in all social relations. The Quran teaches not 
only high morals, but also good manners, for it is meant for everyone. In this 



532 33. THE ALLIES • 33 : 54 

to give trouble to the Messenger of Allah, nor to marry his wives 
after him ever." Surely this is grievous in the sight of Allah. 54 If 
you do a thing openly or do it in secret, then surely Allah is ever 
Knower of all things. 

55 There is no blame on them in respect of their fathers, nor 
their sons, nor their brothers, nor their brothers' sons, nor their 
sisters' sons, nor their own women, nor of what their right hands 
possess — and (O you women) keep your duty to Allah. Surely 
Allah is ever Witness over all things. 56 Surely Allah and His 
angels bless the Prophet. O you who believe, call for blessings on 
him and salute him with a (becoming) salutation. 57 Surely those 
who malign Allah and His Messenger, e Allah has cursed them in 
this world and the Hereafter, and He has prepared for them a 
humiliating punishment. 58 And those who malign believing men 
and believing women undeservedly, they bear the guilt of slander 
and manifest sin. 



verse it disparages the custom of giving trouble to the owner of a house who 
invites his friends to a dinner by coming before the appointed time or staying after 
dinner to indulge in idle talk. This is a rule which the Muslims were desired to 
observe towards one another as well as towards the Holy Prophet. 

a (53-2) The respect due to the Prophet is alone a sufficient reason for the 
injunction, but a little consideration will show that the absence of the injunction 
would have led to difficulties. One of the objects which the Prophet's marriages 
served was the faithful communication of incidents that play an important part in 
the life of a man, but whose knowledge is only limited to a man's family circle. 
The remarriage of any of the Prophet's widows would have surely impaired this 
object to a great degree, as it would have had a possible effect upon the independ- 
ence of opinion of the lady who entered into marital obligations with another man. 

b (56) The invocation of Divine blessings on the Holy Prophet is mentioned 
in connection with the false imputations against him as regards his marital rela- 
tions, the implication being that all such imputations would be brought to naught 
by the blessings which Allah would shower on him, showing that he is pure and 
holds communion with the fountain-head of purity. 

c (57) The word translated as "malign" is from the root adha and it refers 
here to the false imputations of the disbelievers and the hypocrites against the 
Holy Prophet. This sense of the word is made clear in the next verse, where the 
same word is used about the believers, and is explained at the end of the verse as 
indicating a false accusation against them. 



33 : 59 • THOSE WHO SPREAD EVIL REPORTS 533 

Section 8: Those who spread Evil Reports 

59 O Prophet, tell jour wives and your daughters and the 
women of believers to let down upon them their over-garments. 
This is more proper, so that they may be known, and not be given 
trouble. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful." 60 If the hypo- 
crites and those in whose hearts is a disease and the agitators in 
Madinah do not stop, We shall certainly urge you on against them, 
then they shall not be your neighbours in it but for a little while — 
"accursed, wherever they are found they will be seized and killed. 
62 That was the way of Allah concerning those who have gone 
before; and you will find no change in the way of Allah. 

63 People ask you about the Hour. Say: The knowledge of it 
is only with Allah. And what will make you comprehend that the 
Hour may be near? 64 Surely Allah has cursed the disbelievers 
and prepared for them a burning Fire, 65 to abide in it for a long 
time; they will find no protector nor helper. 66 0n the day when 
their leaders are turned back into the Fire, they say: If only we had 
obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger! 67 And they say: Our 
Lord, we only obeyed our leaders and our great men, so they led 
us astray from the path. 68 0ur Lord, give them a double punish- 
ment and curse them with a great curse. 

Section 9: An Exhortation to the Faithful 

69 O you who believe, do not be like those who maligned 
Moses, but Allah cleared him of what they said. And he was 
worthy of regard with Allah. c 70 O you who believe, keep your 



a (59) The injunction to wear an over-garment is here given with the object 
that women may not be annoyed and followed by men inclined to evil, who would 
come to know by this mark of distinction that these were pure and chaste women 
who would not tolerate insult or ill-treatment. 

b (63) By the Hour is meant the hour of their doom, as prophesied in the 
previous verses. 

c (69) For a false imputation against Moses by his own people, and even his 
own sister, see the book of Numbers, ch. 12. As this chapter deals with false impu- 
tations, the case of a false imputation against the prophet in whose likeness the

duty to Allah and speak straight words: 71 He will put your deeds 
into a right state for you, and forgive you your sins. And whoever 
obeys Allah and His Messenger, he indeed achieves a mighty 
success. 

72 Surely We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth 
and the mountains, but they refused to be unfaithful to it and 
feared from it, and man has turned unfaithful to it." Surely he is 
ever unjust, ignorant — 73 that Allah may punish the hypocritical 
men and the hypocritical women, and the men and the women 
who set up partners (with Allah), and Allah will turn (mercifully) 
to the believing men and the believing women. And Allah is ever 
Forgiving, Merciful. 



Holy Prophet came is cited, and attention is drawn to the fate of those who had 
taken part in the accusation. The false accusations against the Holy Prophet are all 
forged by his opponents. 

a (72) The words translated as "unfaithful" to the trust literally mean bear 
the trust. Not bearing the trust signifies paying it back, and bearing the trust 
means being unfaithful to it. The meaning is that nature is true to its laws which 
bring about its evolution, but man is not true to the laws on which depends his 
real happiness. 

(Editor 's Note: "Trust" here may be the spirit or soul breathed into the human 
body by God as stated in 15:29. It is quite different from the animal life which a 
human shares with all animals, along with his physical body. All experiences, 
actions and even thoughts of a human being during his life are imprinted on the 
soul and they make it into an individual personality called nafs by the Quran. This 
nafs is taken away at death, as stated in 39:42, and appears before its Creator 
(50:21) to account for the way the trust placed in him by God was discharged. 
This grave responsibility, if properly discharged, gives it scope wider than the 
earth, higher than the heavens and stronger than the mountains referred to in this 
verse. This is proved by 59:21 as the revelation of the Quran came to the Holy 
Prophet Muhammad without his heart crumbling down.) 



Chapter 34 
Aisaba' Saba 

The title of this chapter is the name of a city (v. 15), Saba, in Yaman 
which was destroyed by a flood. The chapter begins by asserting the truth of 
the judgment, which takes place not only in the life after death but is wit- 
nessed in this life as well. Prosperous nations are destroyed when they fall 
into evil ways, and this judgment will overtake the Quraish as well. It then 
prophesies a victory for the Muslims in an encounter with their enemies, whose 
leaders and followers will blame each other and their deities will be unable to 
help them. In the end it tells us that truth will prosper and falsehood will 
vanish before it. Chapters 34 to 39 form one group, belonging most probably 
to the middle period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Judgment is Certain 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Praise be to Allah, Whose is whatsoever is in the heavens 
and whatsoever is in the earth, and to Him be praise in the Here- 
after! And He is the Wise, the Aware. 2 He knows what goes down 
into the earth and what comes out of it, and what comes down 
from heaven and what goes up to it. And He is the Merciful, the 
Forgiving. 

3 And those who disbelieve say: The Hour will never come to 
us. Say: Indeed, by my Lord, the Knower of the unseen, it will 
certainly come to you! Not an atom's weight escapes Him in the 
heavens or in the earth, nor is there less than that nor greater, but 
(all) is in a clear book, a 4 that He may reward those who believe 
and do good. For them is forgiveness and an honourable sus- 
tenance. 5 And those who strive hard in opposing Our Messages, 
for them is a painful punishment of an evil kind. 



a (3) The verse states the immutable law that every deed is followed by a 
consequence, and nothing should be looked upon as too small to produce an 
effect. The two verses that follow are an illustration of this law; good meets with a 
good reward and evil with an evil punishment.

536 34. SABA • 34 : 6 

6 And those who have been given knowledge see that what is 
revealed to you from jour Lord, is the Truth and it guides into the 
path of the Mighty, the Praised. 7 And those who disbelieve say: 
Shall we show you a man who informs you that, when you are 
scattered the utmost scattering, you will then be in a new creation? 
8 Has he forged a lie against Allah or is there madness in him? No, 
those who do not believe in the Hereafter are in torment and in far 
error. 9 Do they not see what is before them and what is behind 
them of the heaven and the earth? If We please, We can make 
them low in the land or bring down upon them a portion of 
heaven. Surely there is a sign in this for every servant turning (to 
Allah)." 

Section 2: Favours followed by Retribution 

10 And certainly We gave David abundance from Us: O moun- 
tains, repeat praises with him, and the birds, and We made iron 
pliant to him, c n saying: Make ample (coats of mail), and assign a 
time to the making of coats of mail and (O people) do good. 
Surely I am Seer of what you do. 12 And (We made) the wind 



a (9) This is the ever-recurring argument of the Quran. The disbelievers 
deny the last Resurrection, the life after death, the sublime principle of the 
accountability of human actions, which forms the only basis of high morals, and 
they are told that, as a proof of the truth of the Resurrection, they will be brought 
low in this very life for standing in the way of the advancement of Truth. It is 
compared with the coming of a portion from heaven because they would not be 
able to avert it. 

b (10-1) By the mountains repeating praises of Allah, some understand the 
praising of Allah in the sense in which all inanimate objects are spoken of in the 
Quran as glorifying God, while others think that the mountains' echoing of 
David's loud praises is meant. But the mention of birds, the attendants of a vic- 
torious army (see 16:79), and iron along with it shows that the reference is to the 
conquests of David; and the singing of praises by the mountains therefore carries 
the significance of those residing on mountains yielding to David. 

c (10-2) The making of iron pliant to him signifies the extensive use of iron 
by him in his battles, and so do the coats of mail in the next verse. 

rf(ll) David is enjoined to prepare himself and his army for severe battles, 
hence the necessity of coats of mail to save life. Some think that the command- 
ment signifies that David should not take anything from the treasury for his own 



34 : 13 • FAVOURS FOLLOWED BY RETRIBUTION 537 

(subservient) to Solomon; it made a month's journey in the 
morning and a month's journey in the evening;" and We made a 
fountain of molten brass to flow for him. And some of the jinn 
worked before him by the command of his Lord. And whoever 
turned aside from Our command from among them, We made him 
taste of the punishment of burning. e 13 They made for him what he 
pleased, of synagogues and images, and bowls (large) as watering- 
troughs and fixed cooking-pots. d Give thanks, O people of David! 
And very few of My servants are grateful. 14 But when We decreed 
death for him, nothing showed them his death but a creature of the 
earth that ate away his staff. So when it fell down, the jinn saw 
clearly that, if they had known the unseen, they would not have 
remained in humiliating torment. 6 



livelihood, and that he should earn his livelihood by an industry, such as the mak- 
ing of coats of mail. According to one interpretation, assigning a time indicates 
that David is commanded not to employ his whole time in such occupations, for 
the real object is to do good. 

a (12-1) See 21:81. The significance is that Solomon's ships were made to 
traverse a month's journey in a day by favourable winds. For Solomon's navy, see 

1 Kings 9:26. But it should be noted that rih ("wind") means also power or 
dominance or conquest, and therefore the meaning may be that Solomon's king- 
dom was so large that it was a month's journey to the East and a month's journey 
to the West. 

b (12-2) See 2 Chronicles, 4:2. 

c (12-3) These jinn were no other than the strangers whom Solomon sub- 
jected to his rule and forced into service. See 2 Chronicles, 2:2-18. Note that the 
jinn of this verse are the "devils" (shayatin) of 38:37 — "(We subjected to 
Solomon) the devils, every builder and diver" — where the devils are explained 
by the Quran itself to be no others than the builders and divers whom Solomon 
had forced into labour. 

d (13) For the graving of cherubims on the walls, see 2 Chronicles, 3:7; for 
the casting of oxen, 2 Chronicles, 4:3; for the making of lavers, pots, basins, etc., 

2 Chronicles, 4:11, 14. 

e (14) The reference in the creature of the earth that ate away his staff is to 
his son's weak rule, under whom the kingdom of Solomon went to pieces. It 
appears that Solomon's successor, Rehoboam, led a life of luxury and ease, and 
instead of acting on the advice of the older men, he yielded to the pleasure- 
seeking wishes of his companions (1 Kings 12:13), and it is to his luxurious habits 
and easy mode of life that the Quran refers when it calls him a creature of the 
earth. The eating away of his staff signifies the disruption of the kingdom. The 



538 34. SABA -34:15 

15 Certainly there was a sign for Saba in their abode — two 
gardens on the right and the left." Eat of the sustenance of your 
Lord and give thanks to Him. A good land and a Forgiving Lord! 
16 But they turned aside, so We sent upon them a violent torrent, 
and in place of their two gardens We gave them two gardens 
yielding bitter fruit and (growing) tamarisk and a few lote-trees. 
i 7 With this We recompensed them because they were ungrateful; 
and We punish none but the ungrateful. 18 And We made, between 
them and the towns which We had blessed, (other) towns within 
sight, c and We determined the journey between them (to be easy): 
Travel through them nights and days, secure. 19 But (it was as if) 
they said: Our Lord, make longer stages between our journeys."' 
And they wronged themselves; so We made them stories and 
scattered them a total scattering. Surely there are signs in this for 
every patient, grateful one. 

20 And the devil indeed found true his conjecture about them, 
so they follow him, except a group of the believers. 21 And he has 
no authority over them, but that We may know him who believes 
in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt about it. And your Lord 
is the Preserver of all things. 



jinn, as already remarked, mean the rebellious tribes who had been reduced to 
subjection by Solomon, and who remained in subjection to the Israelites for a 
time, until the kingdom was shattered. This instance, as well as the one following, 
contains a warning for the Muslims as to the result of falling into luxury and ease, 
by which, however, they benefited little; the ultimate fate of the respective king- 
doms of the Umayyads and Abbasides was the same as that of Solomon's 
kingdom. See also 38:34. 

a (15) Saba ' was a city in Yaman, about three days' journey from San'a. 
Note that it is usual to speak of two gardens, for large cultivated areas were 
bounded by a garden on each side. 

b (16) The bursting of the dyke of this city and its destruction by a flood are 
historically known facts, and took place in about the first or second century C.E. 

c (18) The cities were so close to each other that one could be seen from the 
other, or they were conspicuous from the road. It is an indication of the great 
prosperity of the country. The blessed towns are the towns of Syria, with which 
they carried on trade. 

d (19) It is not necessary that they should have thus prayed in words. It is a 
description of their actual condition, i.e., they were not grateful for the blessings 
and fell into evil ways, which resulted in punishment overtaking them. 



34 : 22 • A VICTORY FOR THE MUSLIMS 539 

Section 3: A Victory for the Muslims 

22 Say: Call upon those whom you assert (as gods) besides 
Allah; they do not control the weight of an atom in the heavens or 
in the earth, nor have they any partnership in either, nor has He a 
helper among them." 23 And intercession does not avail with Him, 
except of one whom He permits. Until when fear is removed from 
their hearts, they say: What is it that your Lord said? They say: 
The Truth. And He is the Most High, the Great. 24 Say: Who gives 
you sustenance from the heavens and the earth? Say: Allah. And 
surely we or you are on a right way or in manifest error. 25 Say: 
You will not be asked of what we are guilty, nor shall we be asked 
of what you do. 26 Say: Our Lord will gather us together, then He 
will judge between us with truth. And He is the Best Judge, the 
Knower. e 27 Say: Show me those whom you join with Him as part- 
ners. By no means (can you)! Indeed, He is Allah, the Mighty, the 
Wise. 

28 And We have not sent you but as a bearer of good news 
and as a warner to all mankind, but most people do not know. 
29 And they say: When will this promise be (fulfilled), if you are 
truthful? 30 Say: You have the appointment of a day which you 
cannot postpone by an hour, nor bring it forward. 6 



a (22) It refers to the helplessness of the supposed gods to assist their 
votaries when distress overtakes them. 

b (24) The meaning is that as surely as you are in manifest error, so surely 
are we on a right way. 

c (26) This is a prophecy which was fulfilled in the first decisive battle 
which clearly decided the issue between the Muslims and their opponents. The 
question in v. 29 — when will this promise be fulfilled? — makes it quite clear. 

d (28) The Prophet is repeatedly spoken of as having been sent as a messen- 
ger to all people, in the earliest as well as the later revelations. He is called "A 
warner to the nations" (25:1), "A mercy to the nations" (21:107), and so on. In 
one place, his being sent to people is qualified by the word jaml'-an (7:158), 
which means all. Here it is qualified by the word kaffah, which means all without 
an exception. 

e (30) The first encounter between the Muslims and their enemies took place 
in the battle of Badr, after the first year of the Flight had passed away. Elsewhere 
the same question is answered by the words: "Maybe somewhat of what you seek 
to hasten has drawn near to you" (27:72). 



540 34. SABA -34:31 

Section 4: The Leaders of Evil 

31 And those who disbelieve say: We do not believe in this 
Quran, nor in what is before it. And if you could see when the 
wrongdoers are made to stand before their Lord, throwing back 
the blame to one another! Those who were considered weak say to 
those who were proud: If it were not for you, we would have been 
believers. 32 Those who were proud say to those who were con- 
sidered weak: Did we turn you away from the guidance after it 
had come to you? But you (yourselves) were guilty. 33 And those 
who were considered weak say to those who were proud: But (it 
was your) planning by night and day when you told us to dis- 
believe in Allah and to set up likes with Him. And they will 
manifest regret when they see the punishment. And We put chains 
on the necks of those who disbelieve. They will not be recom- 
pensed but for what they did. 

34 And We never sent a warner to a town but those who led 
easy lives in it said: We are disbelievers in that with which you 
are sent. 35 And they say: We have more wealth and children, and 
we cannot be punished. 36 Say: Surely my Lord amplifies provision 
for whom He pleases, and restricts (it also), but most people do 
not know." 

Section 5: Wealth does not stand for Greatness 

37 And it is not your wealth, nor your children, that bring you 
near to Us in rank; but whoever believes and does good, for such 
is a double reward for what they do, and they are secure in the 
highest places. 38 And those who strive in opposing Our messages, 
they will be brought to the punishment. 39 Say: Surely my Lord 
amplifies provision for whom He pleases of His servants, and 



a (36) This expression is always used to signify that Allah will give ample 
means of subsistence to the weaker party and strengthen them against the wealthy 
transgressors. 

b (37) Not only in the highest places in paradise, but also in the highest 
places in this life — a truth which finds abundant illustration in the lives of the 
early Muslims.

restricts (it) for him (also). And whatsoever you spend, He increases 
it in reward," and He is the Best of providers. 

40 And on the day when He will gather them all together, 
then will He say to the angels: Did these worship you? 41 They will 
say: Glory be to You! You are our Protecting Friend, not they; 
rather, they worshipped the jinn; most of them were believers in 
them.* 42 So on that day you will not control benefit nor harm for 
one another. And We will say to those who were wrongdoers: 
Taste the punishment of the Fire, which you called a lie. 

43 And when Our clear messages are recited to them, they 
say: This is only a man who desires to turn you away from what 
your fathers worshipped. And they say: This is nothing but a 
forged lie! And those who disbelieve say of the Truth when it 
comes to them: This is only clear enchantment! 44 And We have 
not given them any Books which they read, nor did We send to 
them before you a warner. c 45 And those before them rejected (the 
truth), and these have not yet attained a tenth of what We gave 
them/ but they rejected My messengers. How (terrible) was then 
My disapproval! 

Section 6: Truth will prosper 

46 Say: I exhort you only to one thing, that you rise up for 
Allah's sake by twos and singly; then ponder! There is no mad- 
ness in your companion. He is only a warner to you before a 
severe punishment. 47 Say: Whatever reward I ask of you, that is 
only for yourselves. My reward is only with Allah, and He is a 



a (39) The words "increases it" (yukhlifu-hu) signify that Allah gives him 
such a great reward as to leave behind what he had spent in His way. 

b (41) Compare this with the last section, and it will be clear that the very 
persons mentioned there as the proud ones are spoken of here as the jinn. 

c (44) That is, no Book was ever given nor any warner ever raised that 
taught the worship of others besides the One God; or the meaning may be that, 
whereas warners appeared all about Arabia, Makkah had not yet seen one. 

d (45) That is, in power or in material prosperity the Quraish could not stand 
comparison with many of the early nations.

Witness over all things. 48 Say: Surely my Lord casts the Truth, the 
great Knower of the unseen. 49 Say: The Truth has come, and false- 
hood neither originates, nor reproduces." 50 Say: If I go astray, only 
to my own loss do I go astray; and if I go aright, it is because of 
what my Lord reveals to me. Surely He is Hearing, Near. 

51 And if only you could see when they become terrified, but 
(then) there will be no escape and they will be seized from a near 
place;* 52 and they will say: We believe in it. And how can they 
attain (to faith) from a distant place? c 53 And they indeed dis- 
believed in it before, and they utter conjectures with regard to the 
unseen from a distant place. d 54 And a barrier is placed between 
them and what they desire, 6 as was done with their partisans before. 
Surely they are in a disquieting doubt. 



a (49) The Truth may stand for Unity and falsehood for polytheism, the 
significance being that idol-worship will never again find access to Makkah. 
Compare 17:81: "Say: The Truth has come and falsehood vanished. Surely false- 
hood is ever bound to vanish". 

b (51) In this world, they were seized upon at Badr and again at Makkah. 

c (52) For death shall then have removed them into the other world. 

rf(53) Their conjectures that the Prophet will not be successful have no 
value, as they have no access to the unseen. 

e (54) Indeed, no punishment is greater than failure to attain what a person 
desires most eagerly. This is the hell of this life. 



Chapter 35 
Ai-Fmir The Originator 

The title of this chapter is taken from the Divine attribute the Originator 
mentioned in the first verse. God, as Originator of the heavens and the earth, 
sweeps away the old order and generates a new one. The chapter begins by 
referring to Divine favours upon mankind and asserts the promise that truth 
will prevail. It then prophesies the rising of a new generation to promote the 
cause of truth and justice in the world. After this, it promises success to the 
believers, and at the end it reiterates the law that punishment is due to evil 
deeds. Chapters 34 to 39 form one group, belonging most probably to the 
middle period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Divine Favours 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Praise be to Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the 
earth," the Maker of the angels, messengers flying on wings, two, 
and three, and four. He increases in creation what He pleases. 



a (1-1) God is here mentioned by his name Fatir, which means one who 
splits, and also who originates or brings a thing into existence for the first time. 
There may be reference to the creation of primeval matter in the original signifi- 
cance of cleaving or splitting. From the same root is the word fitrah, which means 
nature or original quality in which all human beings are said to have been made 
— "the nature made by Allah in which He has created mankind" (30:30). So there 
may be reference to this fitrah in the use of the word Fatir, as the fitrah or nature 
of man has a close relation with the Fatir or the Maker of that fitrah. 

b (1-2) The janah or wing of an angel by no means indicates the fore-limbs 
of a bird, which fit it for flight. It is a symbol of power enabling these immaterial 
beings to execute their functions, and in Arabic the word janah stands for power. 
Angels are here spoken of as having two, three or four wings. There may be a 
reference here to the rak 'ahs of prayer which are two, three or four in number in 
various prayers. In prayer man holds communion with God and is raised to spiri- 
tual eminence; he, as it were, flies to God, is on his wings, and the angels are the 
agents which make him fly to God, their wings thus standing for the rak' ahs of 
prayer. 



543 



544 35. THE ORIGINATOR • 35 : 2 

Surely Allah is Powerful over all things." 2 Whatever Allah grants 
to people of (His) mercy, there is none to withhold it, and what He 
withholds, none can grant thereafter. And He is the Mighty, the 
Wise. 3 people, call to mind the favour of Allah to you. Is there 
any Creator besides Allah who provides for you from the heaven 
and the earth? There is no God but He. How are you then turned 
away (from truth)! 4 And if they reject you — truly messengers 
before you were rejected. And to Allah are all affairs returned. 

5 O people, surely the promise of Allah is true, so do not let 
the life of this world deceive you. And do not let the arch-deceiver 
deceive you about Allah. 'Surely the devil is your enemy, so take 
him for an enemy. He only invites his followers to be companions 
of the burning Fire. 7 Those who disbelieve, for them is a severe 
punishment. And those who believe and do good, for them is 
forgiveness and a great reward. 

Section 2: Truth will prevail 

8 Is he whose evil deed is made attractive to him so that he 
considers it good (able to be guided aright)? Now surely Allah 
leaves in error whom He pleases and guides aright whom He 
pleases, so do not let jour soul waste in grief for them. Surely 
Allah is Knower of what they do. 9 And Allah is He Who sends the 
winds, so they raise a cloud, then We drive it on to a dead land, 
and with it We give life to the earth after its death. Even so is the 
rising. 10 Whoever desires might, then to Allah belongs the might 
wholly. To Him do ascend the goodly words, and the goodly deed 
— He exalts it. And those who plan evil — for them is a severe 
punishment. And their plan will perish. c 



a (1-3) The increase in creation may refer in a general sense to the new 
creation which is going on momentarily in this universe, or there may be a 
reference here to the increase in the number of the elect which was to be brought 
about through the Prophet. Or still again, the meaning may be that the power of 
angels is not limited to two, three or four wings, for there are angels of mighty 
power like Gabriel, who is spoken of as having six hundred wings. 

b (9) This is clearly the rising to spiritual life. 

c (10) Good words ascend to God, i.e., prosper and bear fruit, and good 
deeds are exalted, while the evil plans to destroy Truth perish. 



35:11' A NEW GENERATION WILL BE RAISED 545 

11 And Allah created you from dust, then from the life-germ, 
then He made you pairs. And no female bears, nor gives birth, 
except with His knowledge. And no one living long is granted 
long life, nor is his life shortened at all, but it is in a book. Surely 
this is easy to Allah." 12 And the two seas are not alike: the one 
sweet, very sweet, pleasant to drink; and the other saltish, bitter. 
Yet from both you eat fresh flesh and bring forth ornaments which 
you wear. And you see the ships cleave through it, that you may 
seek of His bounty and that you may give thanks. 13 He makes the 
night to pass into the day, and makes the day to pass into the 
night, and He has made subservient the sun and the moon, each 
one moves to an appointed time. This is Allah, your Lord; His is 
the kingdom. And those whom you call upon besides Him own 
not a straw. 14 If you call on them, they do not hear your call; and 
if they heard, they could not answer you. And on the day of 
Resurrection they will deny your making them partners (of Allah). 
And none can inform you like the All-Aware One. 

Section 3: A New Generation will be raised 

15 people, it is you that have need of Allah, and Allah is the 
Self-Sufficient, the Praised. 16 If He please, He will remove you 
and bring a new creation. 17 And this is not hard to Allah. 18 And no 
bearer of a burden can bear another's burden. And if one weighed 
down by a burden calls another to carry his load, nothing of it will 
be carried, even though he be near of kin. 7ou can only warn those 
who fear their Lord in secret and keep up prayer. And whoever 
purifies himself, purifies himself only for his own good. And to 
Allah is the eventual coming. 

19 And the blind and the seeing are not alike, 20 nor the 
darkness and the light, 21 nor the shade and the heat. 22 Neither are 
the living and the dead alike. Surely Allah makes whom He 
pleases hear, and you cannot make those hear who are in the 



a (11) There is a hint that the seed of truth is sown and generates in a similar 
manner.

graves." 23 7ou are only a warner. 24 Surely We have sent you with 
the Truth as a bearer of good news and a warner. And there is not 
a people but a warner has gone among them. 

25 And if they reject you, those before them also rejected — 
their messengers came to them with clear arguments, and with 
scriptures, and with the illuminating Book. e 26 Then I seized those 
who disbelieved, so how (terrible) was My disapproval! 

Section 4: The Elect 

27 Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the 
clouds, then We bring forth with it fruits of various colours? And 
in the mountains are streaks, white and red, of various colours and 
(others) intensely black. 28 And of mankind and beasts and cattle 
there are various colours likewise. Those of His servants only who 
are possessed of knowledge fear Allah. Surely Allah is Mighty, 
Forgiving. 

29 Surely those who recite the Book of Allah and keep up 
prayer and spend (on good works) out of what We have given 
them, secretly and openly, hope for a gain which does not perish 
— 30 that He may pay them back fully their rewards and give them 
more out of His grace. Surely He is Forgiving, Multiplier of 
reward. 31 And what We have revealed to you of the Book, that is 



a (22) Note how spiritual truths are conveyed in words relating to physical 
life. Those in the graves are the very people who were actively engaged in opposi- 
tion to the Prophet. The seeing are those who have their eyes opened spiritually, 
the light is the spiritual light, the living are those alive in spirit, and so on. 

b (24) This broad doctrine that a prophet was raised among every nation is 
taught repeatedly in the Quran and it is met with in the earlier revelation at 
Makkah as well as the later revelation at Madinah. This great truth, which had 
remained hidden for thousands of years from the wisest men of the world, had 
shone upon the mind of an Arabian who could neither read nor write, who did not 
even know what nations then existed and what scriptures they possessed. This 
broad doctrine alone could form the basis of the universality of a Divine 
message to the whole of mankind. Only he who had the breadth of mind to recog- 
nize truth in all could unite all mankind. 

c (25) See 3:184.

the truth, verifying what is (already) before it.° Surely Allah is 
Aware, Seer of His servants. 32 Then We have given the Book as 
inheritance to those whom We have chosen from among Our 
servants: so some of them do wrong to themselves, and some of 
them take a middle course, and some of them are foremost in 
deeds of goodness by Allah's permission. That is the great grace, 
33 Gardens of perpetuity, which they enter — they are made to 
wear therein bracelets of gold and pearls, and their dress therein is 
silk. e 34 And they say: Praise be to Allah, Who has removed grief 
from us! Surely our Lord is Forgiving, Multiplier of reward, 
35 Who out of His grace has settled us in a house abiding forever; 
therein toil does not touch us nor does fatigue afflict us therein. 6 

36 And those who disbelieve, for them is Fire of hell; it is not 
finished with them so that they should die, nor is its punishment 
lightened to them. Thus do We recompense every ungrateful one. 
37 And in it they cry for help: Our Lord, take us out! we will do 
good deeds, not those which we used to do! Did We not give you 



a (31) Note that as the Quran recognizes that prophets were raised in every 
nation, so it claims that previous revelation contains prophecies which have been 
fulfilled in the advent of the Holy Prophet. This is an early Makkan revelation. 

b (32) After speaking of the revelation of the Quran to the Prophet, we are 
told that the Holy Book was now being given as an inheritance to a chosen 
people, i.e., the Muslim community, who are chosen to carry this great message to 
the whole world. But the chosen people are not all alike. Among them are some 
who wrong themselves — they do not fulfil Divine commandments. There are 
others among them who follow a middle course; they are not wrongdoers but they 
are not very active in the doing of good. There are others still, who are foremost 
in the doing of good, those who have attained to nearness to God. It is thus made 
clear that when a community is spoken of as being a chosen community, all mem- 
bers of it are not alike. It is chosen because of those who are foremost in the doing 
of good, whose example the others should try to follow. 

c (33) The promise refers to this life as well as to the next. See 22:23 footnote. 

d (34) Here is drawn a true picture of paradise: Who has removed grief from 
us. This shows that freedom from grief and anxiety is the real bliss of paradise. 
The repeated promise to the righteous, that they shall have no fear nor shall they 
grieve, expresses the same truth, and shows that paradise begins in this life. 

e (35) Note this further description of a spiritual paradise: where toil and 
fatigue no more afflict a man. It is all peace and satisfaction and the highest bliss.

a life long enough, for him to be mindful who would mind? And 
the warner came to you. So taste; because for the wrongdoers 
there is no helper. 

Section 5: Punishment due to Evil Deeds 

38 Surely Allah is the Knower of the unseen in the heavens 
and the earth. Surely He is Knower of what is in the hearts. 39 He it 
is Who made you successors in the earth. So whoever disbelieves, 
his disbelief is against himself. And their disbelief increases the 
disbelievers with their Lord only in hatred; and their disbelief 
increases the disbelievers in nothing but loss. 

40 Say: Have you seen your associate-gods which you call 
upon besides Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth! 
Or have they any share in the heavens? Or, have We given them a 
Book so that they follow a clear argument from it? No, the wrong- 
doers hold out promises to one another only to deceive. 41 Surely 
Allah upholds the heavens and the earth or they would come to 
naught. And if they come to naught, none can uphold them after 
Him. Surely He is ever Forbearing, Forgiving. 

42 And they swore by Allah, their strongest oaths, that, if a 
warner came to them, they would be better guided than any of the 
nations. But when a warner came to them, it increased them only 
in aversion," 43 behaving proudly in the land and planning evil. 
And the evil plan engulfs none but the authors of it. So they wait 
only for the way of the ancients. But you will find no alteration in 
the course of Allah; and you will find no change in the course of 
Allah. 44 Have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the 
end of those before them — and they were stronger than those in 
power? And Allah is not such that anything in the heavens or the 
earth can escape Him. Surely He is ever Knowing, Powerful. 
45 And if Allah were to punish people for what they earn, He 



a (42) There were Jews and Christians in Arabia who were as corrupt as the 
idolaters of Arabia. The Arabs, therefore, said that, if a prophet came to them as 
prophets came to other people, they would follow him, and set an example of 
goodness.

would not leave on the back of it any creature," but He gives them 
respite till an appointed term; so when their doom comes, then 
surely Allah is ever Seer of His servants. 



a (45) Similar words occur in 16:61: "And if Allah were to destroy people 
for their wrongdoing, He would not leave on it a single creature". Evidently by 
creature here are meant people bent low on earth, people ignorant of the higher or 
spiritual values of life, or the wrongdoers; see 27:82 and 34:14. 



Chapter 36 
Ya Sin 

The title of this chapter is taken from the initial letters Ya Sin which form the 
first verse, meaning O man or O Perfect man, addressing the Holy Prophet. 
The chapter declares the truth of the Quran and begins by saying that its 
revelation will, after initial opposition, give life to a dead humanity. This is 
illustrated by a parable. Signs in nature are pointed to, indicating that the 
same law is working in the spiritual world. It goes on to show that acceptors 
and rejectors of truth will be dealt with distinctly. In the end it draws atten- 
tion to the Resurrection and life after death, an awareness of which makes a 
person feel responsible for his actions. Chapters 34 to 39 form one group, 
belonging most probably to the middle period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Truth of the Quran 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O man," 2 By the Quran, full of wisdom! 3 Surely&gt; , ou are 
one of the messengers, 4 on a right way. 5 A revelation of the 
Mighty, the Merciful, 6 that you may warn a people whose fathers 
were not warned, so they are heedless. 7 The word has indeed 
proved true of most of them, so they do not believe. c 8 Surely We 
have placed on their necks chains reaching up to the chins, so they 
have their heads raised aloft. 9 And We have set a barrier before 



a (1) According to the companion Ibn Abbas Yd Sin means yd insan: 
"O man". There is almost a consensus of opinion that the reference in this 
abbreviation is to the Holy Prophet himself. 

b (6) The first warning of the Prophet was for the Makkans, but he was a 
warner for all nations as well; see 25:1. 

c (7) The word which proved true is that Truth is always opposed first but it 
wins in the end. 

d (8) This is a description of the proud attitude of the disbelievers towards 
the Prophet's preaching. The chains of pride and stubbornness are really the 
things which prevent them from listening to and accepting the message of the 
Prophet. 



550 



36:10' TRUTH OF THE QURAN 551 

them and a barrier behind them, thus We have covered them, so 
that they do not see." 10 And it is the same to them whether you 
warn them or do not warn them — they do not believe. n Fou can 
warn only him who follows the Reminder and fears the Beneficent 
in secret; so give him good news of forgiveness and a generous 
reward. 12 Surely We give life to the dead, and We write down 
what they send on ahead and their footprints, and We record 
everything in a clear writing. 

Section 2: Confirmation of the Truth 

13 And set out to them a parable of the people of the town, 
when messengers came to it. 14 When We sent to them two, they 
rejected them both; then We strengthened (them) with a third, so 
they said: Surely we are sent to you. e 15 They said: You are only 
mortals like ourselves, nor has the Beneficent revealed anything 
— you only lie. 16 They said: Our Lord knows that we are surely 
sent to you. 17 And our duty is only to deliver the message clearly. 
18 They said: Surely we consider you an evil omen. 6 If you do not 



a (9) These were the barriers of their own stubbornness. The barriers before 
them prevented them from looking forward to the eminence to which they could 
rise by following the Truth, and those behind them prevented them from looking 
back to the history of nations destroyed on account of their rejection of the Truth. 

b (12) What they send on ahead are their deeds, and their footprints are the 
marks they leave behind for others to follow. 

c (14) This is called a parable in the previous verse; therefore it is an error to 
name a particular town and three messengers who went together to it. The parable 
is set forth only to point out the truth of the Holy Prophet. The two messengers 
sent before are Moses and Jesus, both of whom clearly prophesied the advent of 
the Holy Prophet, and the third, with whom they are strengthened, is no other than 
the Holy Prophet himself, the fulfilment of prophecy in whose person without 
doubt strengthened the truth of previous revelation. The conversion of Arabia and 
its reclamation from idolatry had been tried both by the followers of Moses and 
Jesus, and both had failed, and a third messenger was now sent. 

d (15) Note that the people here deny all revelation. The Arabs rejected pre- 
vious revelation as well as the revelation of the Holy Prophet. 

e (18) Distress in one form or other always overtakes a people when a 
prophet appears among them. See 6:42. It is to this distress that the rejectors of 
messengers refer. 



552 36. YASIN -36:19 

stop, we will surely stone you, and a painful punishment from us 
will certainly afflict you. 19 They said: Your evil fortune is with 
you. What! If you are reminded! Indeed, you are an extravagant 
people. 

20 And from the remote part of the city a man came running. 

He said: My people, follow the messengers. 21 Follow him who 

* asks of you no reward, and they are on the right course. * 22 And 

2 what reason have I that I should not serve Him Who created me 

£ and to Whom you will be brought back. 23 Shall I take besides Him 

gods whose intercession, if the Beneficent should desire to afflict 

me with harm, will not avail me in the least, nor can they deliver 

me? 24 Then I shall surely be in clear error. 25 Surely I believe in 

your Lord, so hear me. 

26 It was said: Enter the Garden.' He said: If only my people 
knew 27 how my Lord has forgiven me and made me from among 
the honoured ones! 28 And We did not send down upon his people 
after him any army from heaven, nor do We ever send/ 29 It was 
but a single cry, e and lo! they were still. 30 Alas for the servants! 
Never does a messenger come to them but they mock him. 31 Do 
they not see how many generations We destroyed before them, 
that they do not return to them? * 32 And all — surely all — will be 
brought before Us. 



a (19) They are told that distress is not due to the Prophet's advent, but is the 
result of their own evil deeds, and the Prophet does no more than remind them 
and warn them of the consequences of their evil deeds. 

b (20) This man represents the believer in the Truth. Every prophet has 
testimony borne to his truth by one from among the people themselves. Thus the 
Quran speaks of a believer from among the people of Pharaoh (40:28), and Joseph 
of Arimathaea believed in and helped Jesus. The Prophet Muhammad had such a 
follower in Abu Bakr, who was the first to believe, while the others rejected. 

c (26) It is a promise to the believer that he will be successful. 

d (28) Armies are not sent down from above to chastise the wicked, but 
causes are brought into existence on this very earth. 

e (29) The single cry signifies only a sudden punishment. 

/(31) The words may also mean that many generations were destroyed before 
them because they did not turn to the messengers. 



36:33' SIGNS OF THE TRUTH 553 

Section 3: Signs of the Truth 

33 And a sign to them is the dead earth: We give life to it and 
bring forth from it grain so they eat of it." 34 And We make in it 
gardens of date-palms and grapes and We make springs to flow 
forth in it, 35 that they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands 
did not make it. Will they not then give thanks? 36 Glory be to Him 
Who created pairs of all things, of what the earth grows, and of 
their own kind and of what they do not know! 

37 And a sign to them is the night: We draw forth from it the 
(light of) day, then lo! they are in darkness ; c 38 and the sun moves 
on to its destination. That is the ordinance of the Mighty, the 
Knower. 39 And the moon, We have ordained for it stages till it 
becomes again as an old dry palm-branch. 40 Neither is it for the 
sun to overtake the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day. And 
all float on in an orbit. 6 41 And a sign to them is that We carry their 
offspring in the laden ship, 42 and We have created for them (other 
things) the like of it, on which they ride. 43 And if We please, We 



a (33) How dead the earth, and particularly Arabia, was at the advent of the 
Holy Prophet, it is impossible to describe within a footnote. As the physical world 
shows the working of the Divine law that life is restored to the earth after its 
death, the same law would work in the spiritual world. 

b (36) This verse establishes a great scientific truth, that pairs exist in all 
creation, even in the vegetable kingdom and in things which had not yet come to 
the knowledge of man. The Arabs certainly did not know this, but modern research 
corroborates this truth. 

c (37) The night of ignorance must now pass away; for as in the physical 
world night follows day and day follows night, so in the spiritual world light is 
followed by the darkness of ignorance and the latter again gives place to light. 

d (39) Even such is the case of truth, which seems at first to be insignificant, 
but soon shines forth like a full moon. 

e (40) Even truth and falsehood have their courses. As night must disappear 
with the rise of the day, so falsehood must vanish before the light of Truth. The 
flotation of the heavenly bodies in their orbits is a statement beyond the ken of an 
Arabian of the 7th century C.E. The Quran is a book for the spiritual guidance of 
man, but it discloses a large number of scientific truths which were not known to 
man at the time of the revelation of the Book. 

/(42) The ships that bear man on the seas are spoken of in v. 41. These were

may drown them, then there is no help for them, nor can they be 
rescued " — 44 but by mercy from Us and for enjoyment till a time. 

45 And when it is said to them: Guard against what is before 
you and what is behind you, that mercy may be shown to you. 
46 And no message comes to them of the messages of their Lord 
but they turn away from it. 47 And when it is said to them: Spend 
(on good works) out of what Allah has given you, those who 
disbelieve say to those who believe: Shall we feed him whom, if 
Allah please, He could feed? You are in nothing but clear error. c 
48 And they say: When will this promise come to pass, if you are 
truthful? 49 They await but a single cry, which will overtake them 
while they argue. 50 So they will not be able to make a bequest, nor 
will they return to their families. d 

Section 4: Reward and Punishment 

51 And the trumpet is blown, when lo! from their graves they 
will hasten on to their Lord. 52 They will say: O woe to us! Who 
has raised us up from our sleeping-place? e This is what the 



known to man at the time of the revelation of the Quran. But this verse speaks of 
other ships, like them. These are the aeroplanes of today. They are spoken of as 
being created by God, because it is through the knowledge and means that God 
has given man that he is able to acquire mastery of the air and make these ships. 

a (43) This is a warning of the impending punishment. Drowning in the sea 
signifies their destruction, wherever it may take place. The word chosen to des- 
cribe the punishment is one which shows the utter helplessness of the sufferers. 

b (45) What is before you signifies the punishment which must overtake 
them in this life, and what is behind you means the consequences of evil which 
they would witness in the Hereafter. 

c (47) So they turned neither to submission to Allah, nor to sympathy for 
their fellow-beings. 

d (50) This is a prophetical description of the battle of Badr. The Quraish 
attacked Madinah to annihilate Islam but the leaders of evil were themselves fini- 
shed there, and could neither make a bequest, nor did they return to their families. 

e (52) The grave is called a sleeping-place even for the disbelievers, because, 
as compared with the severer punishment of hell, the grave would be to them a 
sleeping-place. It should be noted that the grave signifies the condition after life is 
ended in this world. 



36:53' REWARD AND PUNISHMENT 555 

Beneficent promised and the messengers told the truth. 53 It is 
but a single cry, when lo! they are all brought before Us. 54 So this 
day no soul is wronged in the least and you are only rewarded for 
what you did. 

55 Surely the owners of the Garden are on that day in a happy 
occupation. 56 They and their wives are in shades, reclining on 
raised couches. 57 In it they have fruits and they have whatever 
they desire. 58 Peace! A word from a Merciful Lord." 

59 And withdraw today, O guilty ones! 60 Did I not charge 
you, O children of Adam, not to serve the devil? Surely he is your 
open enemy. 61 And that you serve Me. This is the right way. 
62 And certainly he led astray numerous people from among you. 
Could you not then understand? 63 This is the hell which you were 
promised. 64 Enter it this day because you disbelieved. 65 That day 
We shall seal their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and 
their feet will bear witness as to what they earned. 66 And if We 
pleased, We would put out their eyes, then they would struggle to 
get ahead to (find) the way, but how should they see? ft 67 And if 
We pleased, We would transform them in their place so they 
would be unable to go on or turn back.' 

Section 5: The Resurrection 



68 And whomever We grant long life, We cause him to 
deteriorate in creation. Do they not understand? 69 And We have 
not taught him poetry, 6 nor is it befitting for him. This is nothing 



a (58) Here we have another picture of the Muslim paradise. After describ- 
ing the various blessings, it sums them up in a single word, peace. 

b (66) These are the reprobate. They shut their eyes to the truth with such 
persistence that their eyes become blind; they no longer see, even if they would. 

c (67) The meaning of transforming them in their place is taking away their 
power and rendering them weak and turning them into an evil plight. 

d (68) It is a general law of nature that every living thing must deteriorate; 
the application here is to individuals as well as nations. 

e (69) Its negation as poetry is meant to convey the seriousness of the sub- 
jects that the Quran deals with.

but a Reminder and a plain Quran, 70 to warn him who would have 
life, and (that) the word may prove true against the disbelievers. 

71 Do they not see that We have created cattle for them, out of 
what Our hands have made, so they are their masters? 72 And We 
have subjected them to them, so some of them they ride, and some 
they eat. 73 And in them they have (other) advantages and drinks. 
Will they not then give thanks? 74 And they take gods besides 
Allah that they may be helped. 75 They are not able to help them, 
and they will be a group brought up (for judgment) before them." 
76 So do not let their speech grieve you. Surely We know what they 
do in secret and what they do openly. 

77 Does not man see that We have created him from the small 
life -germ? Then lo! he is an open contender. 78 And he strikes out a 
likeness for Us and forgets his own creation. Says he: Who will 
give life to the bones, when they are rotten? 79 Say: He will give 
life to them, Who brought them into existence at first, and He is 
Knower of all creation, 80 Who produced fire for you out of the 
green tree, so that with it you kindle. c 81 Is not He Who created the 
heavens and the earth Able to create the like of them? Yes! And 
He is the Creator (of all), the Knower. 



a (75) The guilty leaders will be brought up for punishment before their 
followers and they will not be able to help them. Or, the worshippers of false 
deities will be brought up for punishment in the presence of those deities and they 
will not be able to help them. 

b (78) Striking out of a likeness signifies the setting up of gods with Allah. 

c (80) Editor's Note: This may refer to the process of photosynthesis. The 
green substance in tree leaves, chlorophyll, absorbs sunlight to produce carbo- 
hydrates and oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. This process is the basis of 
supporting physical life on earth. Similarly, light from the sun of Truth, the Holy 
Prophet (called Yd Sin), produces a higher life in those who follow him. 

d (81) The personal pronoun them refers to people, not to heaven and earth. 
In the Resurrection, people will be the like of what they are here, not the same 
earthly bodies. The body may become dust; but what a person does of good or 
evil is preserved, and it is according to this good or evil that he receives a new 
body. The idea of Resurrection is carried to perfection in Islam, and the Resurrec- 
tion is meant to give a new life to all. Ultimately the spirit of man is returned to 
the Spirit Divine, and that is again and again called the meeting with God. 



36 : 82 • REWARD AND PUNISHMENT 557 

82 His command, when He intends anything, is only to say to 
it, Be, and it is. 83 So glory be to Him in Whose hand is the 
kingdom of all things, and to Him you will be returned. 



Chapter 37 
Ai-saffat Those Ranging in Ranks 

The title of this chapter is taken from its opening words which give a descrip- 
tion of the faithful. It begins by announcing a clear prophecy of the ultimate 
victory of the doctrine of Oneness of God and then establishes the truth of the 
judgment. After this, the preachings of a number of prophets are mentioned, 
the last of these being Jonah. The chapter concludes with a prediction of the 
triumph of the Holy Prophet. Chapters 34 to 39 form one group, belonging 
most probably to the middle period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Unity will prevail 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By those ranging in ranks," 2 and those who restrain holding 
in restraint, 3 and those who recite the Reminder, 4 surely your God 



a (1) The waw, which means and, is in such places rendered as by, and signi- 
fies an oath. In such cases the oath simply draws attention to a certain testimony. 
The real object in taking an oath is to make an assertion more convincing, but in 
the Quran, when such a form is adopted, the conviction is produced not by mere 
allegation, but by some clear argument. Sometimes attention is called in these 
oaths to obvious laws of nature to infer spiritual laws from them, and on other 
occasions the oath reveals a kind of prophecy, whose fulfilment makes the truth of 
the preaching of the Prophet to be obvious. The latter is the case here. 

The description given in verses 1-3 applies to the believers. V.l shows them 
as ranging themselves in ranks, or praying to God standing in ranks, which Mus- 
lims do five times daily in their prayers in congregation, and may prophetically 
refer to their subsequent ranging themselves in ranks in the field of battle against 
their enemies. V. 2 describes them as holding in restraint their passions, so that a 
people who were ruled by their passions or their sensual desires were so entirely 
changed that they became complete masters of their passions. The words may also 
contain a prophecy to their holding in restraint a powerful enemy bent upon their 
extirpation. V. 3 makes it clear that only Muslims are described here: those who 
recite the Reminder. It is a special characteristic of the Muslims that they recite 
the Quran in their prayers, so much so that even their armies in the field of battle 
are regular in their prayers, in which they recite the Quran. And the great Truth 
that is thus established is Divine Unity — surely your God is One.

37:5« UNITY WILL PREVAIL 559 

is One. 5 The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is 
between them, and the Lord of the eastern lands. a 6 Surely We 
have adorned the lower heaven with an adornment, the stars, 7 and 
(there is) a safeguard against every rebellious devil. 8 They 
cannot listen to the exalted assembly and they are reproached from 
every side, c 'driven off; and for them is a perpetual punishment, 
10 except him who snatches away but once, then there follows him 
a brightly shining flame. 6 n So ask them whether they are stronger 



a (5) The reference to the eastern lands is a prophecy of the early spread of 
Islam in the East, while Islam's conquests in the West seem to have been reserved 
for a later age. 

b (7) The Prophet's preaching was confronted by a twofold opposition 
among the Arabs — the secular classes and the priestly class, i.e., the diviners and 
the soothsayers, the class known as Kahin. It is these soothsayers who are called 
the rebellious devils, because they thought that they could invoke spirits and 
answer questions put to them relating to the future. This phase of opposition was 
equally swept away by the forceful tide of Islamic truth, and the profession of the 
Kahin disappeared from Arabia as Islam advanced. The mention of heaven and 
stars in the previous verse refers to the popular superstition that the diviners and 
soothsayers obtained their knowledge of the future from the stars. The safeguard 
against every rebellious devil indicates that they have no access to Divine secrets; 
see further 52:38 and 72:8. 

c (8) The reference here is to the conjectures of the soothsayers regarding the 
future, by which they maintained their ascendancy over the masses. It is pointed 
out that they have no access whatever to the source of prophecy. The exalted 
assembly signifies those angels to whom Divine revelation is first made known. 
Or, the reference may be to the secular opponents of the Prophet, who, it is here 
foretold, would be thrown at from every side, so that success could not attend any 
of their efforts. 

d (9) This verse and those preceding it describe the state of the soothsayers 
at the advent of the Prophet. Before the advent of the Holy Prophet, the sooth- 
sayers may have been able to mislead the people to a certain extent by their guesses 
regarding future events, but after his advent they were reproached on every side, 
and ultimately the profession of the kahin disappeared from Arabia, as shown in 
the footnote to v. 7. Or, the reference may be to the overthrow of ordinary 
opposition. 

e (10) The meaning is that, if a soothsayer gets but one opportunity, there 
soon follows a flame that pierces through the darkness; in other words, dispels the 
darkness to which the soothsayer leads people.

in creation or those (others) whom We have created. Surely We 
created them of firm clay." 

12 But you wonder, while they mock, 13 and when they are 
reminded, they are not mindful, 14 and when they see a sign, they 
seek to scoff, 15 and say: This is nothing but clear enchantment. 
16 When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we 
then be raised, 17 or our forefathers? 18 Say: Yes indeed, and you 
will be humiliated. 19 So it will be but one cry, when lo! they will 
see. 20 And they will say: O woe to us! This is the day of Recom- 
pense. 21 This is the day of Judgment, which you called a lie. 

Section 2: The Judgment 

22 Gather together those who did wrong and their associates, 
and what they worshipped c 23 besides Allah, then lead them to the 
way to hell. 24 And stop them, for they shall be questioned: 25 What 
is the matter with you that you do not help one another? 26 But on 
that day they will be submissive. 27 And they will turn to one 
another, mutually questioning — 28 saying: Surely you used to 
come to us from the right side. 29 They will say: No, you (your- 
selves) were not believers. 30 And we had no authority over you, 
but you were an inordinate people. 31 So the word of our Lord has 
proved true against us: we shall surely taste. 32 We led you astray, 
for we ourselves were in error. 33 So, that day they will be sharers 
in the punishment. 34 Thus do We deal with the guilty. 

35 They indeed were arrogant, when it was said to them: 



a (11) Those created of firm clay are the spiritually perfect men, the Prophet 
and his followers. The verse points to the opposition of the soothsayers to the 
Prophet, and warns the former that the Prophet will be triumphant, because he is 
made perfect by Allah's hand. 

b (18) That is, you will not only be raised after death to taste of your evil 
deeds, but even here you will be brought low. This is again a prophecy of the defeat 
of the enemy in this very life. 

c (22) Though the description of the helplessness of the wrongdoers given in 
this and the following verses applies to life after death, it equally describes their 
condition in this life. 



37 : 36 • THE JUDGMENT 561 

There is no god but Allah; 36 and said: Shall we give up our gods 
for a mad poet? 37 No, he has brought the Truth and verifies the 
messengers. 38 Surely you will taste the painful punishment. 39 And 
you are recompensed only for what you did — 40 except the 
servants of Allah, the purified ones. 41 For them is a known 
sustenance:" 42 fruits. And they are honoured, 43 in Gardens of 
delight, 44 on thrones, facing each other. 45 Round about them is 
made to go a bowl of running water, 46 white, delicious to those 
who drink. 47 It does not deprive of reason, nor are they exhausted 
by it.* 48 And with them are those modest in gaze, having beautiful 
eyes, 49 as if they were eggs, carefully protected. c 

50 Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning. 
51 A speaker from among them will say: Surely I had a comrade, 
52 who said: Are you indeed one of those who accept? 53 When we 
are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then be 
brought to judgment? 54 He will say: Will you look? 55 Then he 
looked down and saw him in the midst of hell. S6 He will say: 



a (41) The word malum ("known") shows that the sustenance mentioned in 
the verses that follow is one that is already known to those servants of Allah who 
are purified from every pollution. This description of the blessings of paradise 
shows that all those blessings were spiritually tasted by the righteous in this life. 
In fact, their brief but important description as fruits in the next verse clearly 
shows those blessings to be the fruits of their good deeds. 

b (47) The drinks of this life, though a source of pleasure, bring evil in their 
train. The drinks of the next life cause neither loss of reason, nor exhaustion. The 
name is common, but the nature of the two is different. 

c (49) The description of women given here calls attention to the prominent 
feature of the character of a good woman. Attention is first called to the fact that 
the most valuable virtue of woman is that rare chastity which is described here as 
modest in gaze or freedom of the eye from lust. Then the beauty of their eyes is 
praised, the suggestion clearly being that the real beauty of the eye consists in its 
purity. Secondly, they are described as being eggs carefully protected, which 
alludes to their pure and unsoiled character. It should, however, be noted that 
what is apparently a description of women is really a description of the fruits of 
deeds done in this life, the words adopted being applicable to both (see the word 
hur in 52:20), and these are in fact spiritual blessings manifested physically. The 
blessings which it promises, whatever they may be, are as much meant for men as 
for women; the only thing certain about them is that their nature is different from 
the nature of the physical blessings of this life. See also 38:52. 



562 37. THOSE RANGING IN RANKS "37:57 

By Allah! you had almost caused me to perish; 57 and if it were not 
for the favour of my Lord, I should have been among those brought 
up (for punishment). 58 Are we not to die, 59 except our previous 
death? And are we not to be punished? 60 Surely this is the mighty 
achievement. 61 For the like of this, then, let the workers work. 

62 Is this the better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum? a 
63 Surely We have made it a trial for the wrongdoers. 64 It is a tree 
that grows in the bottom of hell — 65 its produce is as it were the 
heads of serpents. 66 Then truly they will eat of it and fill (their) 
bellies with it. 67 Then surely they shall have after it a drink of 
boiling water. 68 Then their return is surely to the flaming Fire. 
69 They indeed found their fathers astray, 70 so in their footsteps 
they are hastening on. 71 And most of the ancients surely went 
astray before them, 72 and indeed We sent among them warners. 
73 Then see what was the end of those warned — 74 except the 
servants of Allah, the purified ones. 

Section 3: Noah and Abraham 

75 And Noah certainly called upon Us, and excellent 
Answerer of prayers are We! 76 And We delivered him and his 
people from the great distress; 77 and made his offspring the 
survivors, 78 and granted him among the later generations (the 
salutation) : 79 peace be on Noah among the nations! 80 Thus do We 
reward the doers of good. 81 Surely he was one of Our believing 
servants. 82 Then We drowned the others. 

83 And surely of his party was Abraham. 84 When he came to 
his Lord with a secure heart. 85 When he said to his sire and his 



a (62) Zaqqum is "a dust-coloured tree, having small round leaves without 
thorns. It has a pungent odour and is bitter, and has knots in its stems ... the heads 
of its leaves are very foul" and it also means any deadly food (Lane's Lexicon). 
See also 17:60 and 44:43. 

b (68) The words, then their return is surely to the flaming Fire, axe very 
significant, as if the food and drink described above were to be given to them 
before they went to hell. This is the reason that it is called an entertainment (v. 
62). It is in fact a description of their evil plight in this life as well as in the 
Hereafter.

people: What is it that you worship? 86 A lie — gods besides Allah 
do you desire? 87 What is then your idea about the Lord of the 
worlds? 88 Then he glanced a glance at the stars, 89 and said: Surely 
I am sick (of your deities)." 90 So they turned their backs on him, 
going away. 

91 Then he turned to their gods and said: Do you not eat? 
92 What is the matter with you that you do not speak? 93 So he 
turned upon them, striking with the right hand. 94 Then they came 
to him, hurrying. 95 He said: Do you worship that which you carve 
out? 96 And Allah has created you and what you make. 97 They said: 
Build for him a building, then cast him into the flaming fire. 98 And 
they designed a plan against him, but We brought them low. 

99 And he said: Surely I flee to my Lord — He will guide me. 
100 My Lord, grant me a doer of good deeds. 101 So We gave him 
the good news of a forbearing son. 102 But when he became of age 
to work with him, he said: My son, I have seen in a dream that I 
should sacrifice you: so consider what you think. He said: My 
father, do as you are commanded; if Allah please, you will find me 
patient. 103 So when they both submitted and he had thrown him 
down upon his forehead, 104 and We called out to him saying, 
O Abraham, 105 you have indeed fulfilled the vision. e Thus do We 



a (89) The people with whom Abraham contended were not only wor- 
shippers of idols, but also worshippers of stars. Hence Abraham cast a glance at 
the stars and declared that he could not bear their worshipping others than God. 
The words here may also be translated as / bear spite to your false gods. 

b (102) That the child spoken of here was Ishmael and not Isaac is made 
clear by v. 1 12, which states that it was after this incident that Abraham received 
the news of the birth of Isaac. This, no doubt, contradicts the Bible statement, but 
the fact that Ishmael' s descendants kept a memorial of this sacrifice in the annual 
pilgrimage to Makkah shows clearly that Ishmael, and not Isaac, was the son 
whom Abraham was commanded to sacrifice. Moreover, the Bible contradicts 
itself when it speaks of Isaac as "your only son" (Genesis, 22:2). Only Ishmael 
could be spoken of as "only son" before the birth of Isaac. 

c (105) The words, you have indeed fulfilled the vision, show that the act of 
slaughtering was not needed for the fulfilment of the vision; the preparedness to 
do it amounted to its fulfilment. According to the Bible, Abraham cast out his son 
Ishmael and his mother Hagar in some wilderness when Ishmael was fourteen

reward the doers of good. 106 Surely this is a manifest trial. 107 And 
We ransomed him with a great sacrifice." 

108 And We granted him among the later generations (the 
salutation): 109 Peace be on Abraham! no Thus do We reward the 
doers of good. m Surely he was one of Our believing servants. 
n2 And We gave him the good news of Isaac, a prophet, a right- 
eous one. 113 And We blessed him and Isaac' And among their 
offspring some are doers of good, but some are clearly unjust to 
themselves. 

Section 4: Moses, Aaron, Elias and Lot 

114 And certainly We conferred a favour on Moses and Aaron. 
115 And We delivered them and their people from the mighty distress. 
116 And We helped them, so they were triumphant. 117 And We gave 
them both the clear Book. m And We guided them on the right 
way. 119 And We granted them among the later generations (the 
salutation): 120 Peace be on Moses and Aaron! 121 Thus do We 
reward the doers of good. 122 Surely they were both from among 
Our believing servants. 

123 And Elias was surely one of the messengers. 124 When he 
said to his people: Will you not guard against evil? 125 Do you call 



years of age (Genesis, 21:9-21). The Quran is silent on this point, but, according 
to Bukhari, the incident occurred when Ishmael was yet a suckling, and it was not 
in accordance with the wishes of Sarah but according to a Divine commandment 
that Abraham left Hagar and Ishmael in the wilderness near the Sacred House, 
and it was here, when Ishmael was in distress, that the water at Zamzam was dis- 
covered (Bukhari, 60:9). The reference in the words you have indeed fulfilled the 
vision may be to this incident, Abraham being told that the dream had already 
been fulfilled by casting out Ishmael and leaving him at Makkah. 

a (107) To commemorate Ishmael's sacrifice, a great sacrifice was ordered. 
This was not only the sacrifice of a ram on this particular occasion, but the great 
institution of sacrifice now connected with the pilgrimage to Makkah. Perhaps 
there is also a reference here to the abolition of human sacrifice, which was pre- 
valent among most ancient nations, and the significance is that the place of human 
sacrifice was now forever being taken by the sacrifice of a ram. 

b (113) Abraham and Isaac are spoken of distinctly to show that by blessing 
Abraham is here meant blessing his descendants through Ishmael.

so they shall be brought up (for punishment), 128 but not the servants

generations (the salutation): 130 Peace be on Elias! 131 Thus do We 
reward the doers of good. 132 Surely he was one of Our believing 
servants. 

133 And Lot was surely one of the messengers. 134 When We 
delivered him and his people, all — 135 except an old woman among 
those who remained behind. 136 Then We destroyed the others. 
137 And surely you pass by them in the morning, 138 and at night. Do 
you not then understand? 

Section 5: Jonah and Holy Prophet's Triumph 

139 And Jonah was surely one of the messengers. 140 When he 
fled to the laden ship, e 141 so he drew lots and was of those cast 
away. 142 So the fish took him into its mouth while he was blame- 
able. 143 But if he had not been of those who glorify (Us), 144 he 
would have remained in its belly till the day when they are raised. 6 
145 Then We cast him on the naked shore, while he was sick. 
146 And We caused a gourd plant to grow up for him. 147 And We 



a (125) Ba'l stands for the sun, or the sun-god. 

b (130) IlyasTn, the word used here, is only another form of the name of Ilyas 
or Elias. Elias is mentioned as being one of the prophets in 6:85 and is the same as 
the Elijah of the Bible. 

c (140) It is meaningless to say that Jonah fled from God. He was a prophet 
and knew that no one could flee from God, for God's kingdom is unlimited. Nor 
does the Quran say that he fled from God. It would appear that he fled from his 
people or from the king; see also 21:87 and footnotes. 

d (142) According to Jonah 1:17, Jonah was devoured by a fish. The word 
used in the Quran is iltaqama, which does not necessarily signify the act of 
devouring and means he took into his mouth. According to one explanation, his 
heel only was drawn by the fish into its mouth. 

e (144) The meaning is that the fish would have eaten him, and he would have 
died. By the day when they are raised is not meant the actual day of Resurrection, 
because the fish could not live to the day of Resurrection. A person's death is 
generally called the day of his resurrection in a certain sense.

believed, so We gave them provision till a time. 

149 Now ask them whether your Lord has daughters and they 
have sons? 150 Or did We create the angels females, while they wit- 
nessed? 151 Now surely it is of their own lie that they say: 152 Allah 
has offspring. And truly they are liars. 153 Has He preferred daugh- 
ters to sons? 154 What is the matter with you? How do you judge! 
155 Will you not then be mindful? 156 0r do you have a clear autho- 
rity? 157 Then bring your Book, if you are truthful. 

158 And they assert a relationship between Him and the jinn. 
And certainly the jinn know that they will be brought up (for judg- 
ment) — 159 Glory be to Allah from what they describe! — 160 But 
not so the servants of Allah, the purified ones. e 161 So surely you 
and what you serve, 162 you cannot mislead (anyone) about Him, 
163 except him who will burn in the flaming Fire. 164 And there is 
none of us but has an assigned place, 165 and most surely we are 
ranged in ranks, 166 and we truly glorify (Him). 

167 And surely they used to say: 168 If we had a reminder from 
the ancients, 169 we would have been sincere servants of Allah. 
170 But (now) they disbelieve in it, so they will come to know. 
171 And certainly Our word has already gone forth to Our servants, 
the messengers, 172 that they, surely they, will be helped, 173 and 



a (147) According to the Bible, the gourd gave shelter to Jonah, but the next 
day a worm damaged the plant so that it withered, and Jonah grieved for it. The 
lesson drawn from this incident is stated thus: "But the Lord said, You have had 
pity on the plant for which you have not laboured, nor made it grow, which came 
up in a night and perished in a night. And should I not pity Nineveh, that great 
city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who 
cannot discern between their right hand and their left" (Jonah 4:10-11). These 
were the hundred thousand or more persons to which Jonah was sent. 

b (158) They said that they considered the angels to be daughters of God and 
worshipped them. In the Quran, however, it is stated that it was really the jinn — 
their own leaders in evil — that they worshipped, not the angels; see 34:40^41. 

c (160) It is the evildoers that will be brought up for judgment (v. 158), not 
the servants of Allah. 

d (164) These words are put into the mouth of the believers.

turn away from them till a time, 179 and watch, for they too will

Chapter 38 

Sad 

• 

The title of this chapter is taken from its initial letter Sad which stands for 
Sadiq, meaning here Truthful God. It describes the sufferings of prophets at 
the hands of their enemies but the Truthful God foretold the discomfiture of 
the enemy and the final triumph of truth. It relates the accounts of David and 
Solomon, who faced enmity despite being mighty kings, and then describes 
the tribulations of Job and his deliverance from them. The chapter ends with 
a mention of the typical opposition of the devil to the prophet-man. Chapters 
34 to 39 form one group, belonging most probably to the middle period at 
Makkah. 



Section 1: The Enemy's Discomfiture 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Truthful God! By the Quran, possessing eminence!" 2 But 
those who disbelieve are in self-exaltation and opposition. 3 How 
many a generation We destroyed before them, then they cried when 
there was no longer time for escape! 4 And they wonder that a 
warner from among themselves has come to them, and the 
disbelievers say: This is an enchanter, a liar. 5 Does he make the 
gods a single God? Surely this is a strange thing. 6 And the chiefs 
among them say: Go and steadily adhere to your gods; surely this 
is a thing intended. c 'We never heard of this in the former faith, 
this is nothing but a forgery. 8 Has the Reminder been revealed to 



a (1) Dhikr means eminence here, as in 2:152. The calling to witness of the 
Quran possessing eminence indicates that the truth of the Quran will become 
manifest by the eminence to which it will raise those who follow it. 

b (3) That is, they did not heed the warning, but cried for help when 
punishment actually overtook them, and there was no escape from it. 

c (6) By a thing intended is meant that it is a thing which the Prophet intends 
to bring about but which he cannot, or that the appearance of the Prophet is one of 
the disasters decreed by fate.

him from among us? Indeed, they are in doubt as to My Reminder. 
Indeed, they have not yet tasted My punishment. 

9 Or, do they have the treasures of the mercy of jour Lord, 
the Mighty, the Great Giver? 10 Or is the kingdom of the heavens 
and the earth and all that is between them theirs? Then let them 
rise higher in means. a n What an army of the allies is here put to 
flight! 4 12 The people of Noah, and Ad, and Pharaoh, the lord of 
armies, rejected (prophets) before them, 13 and Thamud and the 
people of Lot and the dwellers of the grove. These were the 
parties (opposing Truth). 14 Each one rejected the messengers, so 
just was My retribution. 

Section 2: David's Enemies 

15 And these wait but for one cry, in which there is no delay. 
16 And they say: Our Lord, hasten on for us our portion (of 
punishment) before the day of Reckoning. 17 Bear patiently what 
they say, and remember Our servant David, the possessor of 
power. He ever turned (to Allah). 18 Truly We made the mountains 
subject to him, glorifying (Allah) at nightfall and sunrise, 19 and 
the birds gathered together. All were obedient to him. 20 And We 
strengthened his kingdom and We gave him wisdom and a clear 
judgment. 



a (10) Their rising higher or ascending in means stands for having recourse 
to all the means they can think of. As they were powerful in the land and masters 
of it, they should find the best means to retain their power, and prove the warning 
of the Prophet to be false. They would not be able to do so. 

b (11) This is a prophecy relating to the discomfiture and overthrow of the 
opponents of Islam when they combine all possible forces against it. The Prophet 
is thus not only enjoined patience under his present sufferings, but he is further 
told that the opposition against him will assume yet more formidable proportions. 
He is comforted at the same time with the knowledge that the combined forces of 
opposition will be utterly routed and overthrown. This happened in the battle 
known as the battle oftheAhzab, or the battle of the Allies; see 33:22. 

c (16) It is clearly a demand on the part of disbelievers for punishment in 
this life; they were again and again told that their doom was coming, and they 
wanted it to come immediately. 

rf(18) See 34:10 footnote 1.

21 And has the story of the adversaries come to you? When 
they made an entry into the private chamber by climbing the wall 
— 22 when they came upon David so he was afraid of them. They 
said: Do not fear; (we are) two litigants, one of whom has 
wronged the other, so decide between us with justice, and do not 
act unjustly, and guide us to the right way. 23 This is my brother. 
He has ninety-nine ewes and I have a single ewe. Then he said, 
Make it over to me, and he has prevailed against me in dispute. 
24 He said: Surely he has wronged you in demanding your ewe (to 
add) to his own ewes. And surely many partners wrong one another 
except those who believe and do good, and very few are they! 
And David knew that We had tried him, so he asked his Lord for 
protection, and he fell down bowing and turned (to God). a 25 So 
We gave him this protection, and surely he had a nearness to Us 
and an excellent destination. 

26 O David, surely We have made you a ruler in the land; so 
judge between people justly, and do not follow desire that it should 
lead you astray from the path of Allah. Those who go astray from 
the path of Allah, for them is surely a severe punishment because 
they forgot the day of Reckoning. 

Section 3: Solomon and his Enemies 

27 And We did not create the heaven and the earth and all that 
is between them in vain. That is the opinion of those who disbelieve. 



a (24) The men who thus attacked David by climbing over the wall were his 
enemies, as the Quran plainly states. They had thought of taking David unawares 
and putting him to death. But David, though terrified, was ready to meet them, 
and the two men, finding their plan thus frustrated, made an excuse for coming to 
him in such an unusual manner. The story of David committing adultery and two 
angels having come to him thus to remind him of the sin is a puerile falsehood, 
wherever it may be found. The word "protection" in this verse and the next by no 
means indicates that David had committed a sin, as the original word (istighfar, 
ghafr) really signifies the seeking of protection from sin. David sought Divine 
protection when he saw that his enemies had grown so bold against him. {Editor 's 
Note: This dispute is also illustrative of the desire of large and powerful organiza- 
tions to bring small ones under their sway. The Quran here supports the judgment 
given in favour of the rights of ownership of the weak against the strong.) 



38 : 28 • SOLOMON 571 

So woe to those who disbelieve on account of the Fire!" 28 Shall 
We treat those who believe and do good like the mischief-makers 
in the earth? Or shall We make the dutiful like the wicked? 29 (This 
is) a Book that We have revealed to you abounding in good, that 
they may ponder over its verses, and that those who have under- 
standing may be mindful. 

30 And We gave to David Solomon. Most excellent the 
servant! Surely he ever turned (to Allah). 31 When well-bred, swift 
(horses) were brought to him at evening — 32 so he said: I love the 
good things on account of the remembrance of my Lord — until 
they were hidden behind the veil. 33 (He said): Bring them back to 
me. So he began to stroke (their) legs and necks. 

34 And certainly We tried Solomon, and We put on his throne 
a (mere) body, so he turned (to Allah). 35 He said: My Lord, for- 
give me and grant me a kingdom which is not fit for anyone after 
me; e surely You are the Great Giver. 36 So We made the wind sub- 
servient to him, running gently by His command wherever he 
desired, 37 and the devils, every builder and diver, 38 and others 



a (27) The believer is guided by the principle of the accountability of human 
actions and of a significance underlying everything that exists in heaven or earth. 
The disbeliever, on the other hand, makes mischief, as he believes that he will not 
be any the worse for it, and thus ignores the law of cause and effect, which pre- 
vails in the universe. 

b (34) By the mere body that was put on his throne is meant either his son 
Rehoboam, who lost the allegiance of all except a single tribe of Israel (1 Kings 
12:17), or Jeroboam, who led the revolt against the house of David, and, on 
becoming king of ten tribes, set up image-worship in Dan and Beth-el, the two 
calves being supposed to be images of Jehovah (1 Kings 12:28), and also began 
the worship of molten images (1 Kings 14:9). Thus both Rehoboam and Jeroboam 
answer the description of a body (without real life) thrown on Solomon's throne. 
See also 34:14 footnote. 

c (35) The previous verse speaks of the imbecile heir-apparent to Solomon's 
throne. Hence we find Solomon praying here for a spiritual kingdom, for that is 
the only kingdom which is not in danger of being spoiled by an heir. The glory of 
Solomon's temporal kingdom was not maintained after his death; nor has a king 
like Solomon appeared in Israel. By anyone after me is meant anyone in Israel, 
not the whole world.

fettered in chains." 39 This is Our free gift, so give freely or with- 
hold, without reckoning. 40 And surely he had a nearness to Us and 
an excellent destination. 

Section 4: Job — Triumph of the Righteous 

41 And remember Our servant Job. When he cried to his Lord: 
The devil has afflicted me with toil and torment. 42 Urge with 
jour foot; here is a cool washing-place and a drink. c 43 And We 
gave him (back) his people and more like them with them/ a 



a (38) The description given here of the devils shows clearly that the desig- 
nation applies to men of foreign tribes subjected to Solomon's rule, because it was 
the latter who were forced into labour by Solomon. The words every builder and 
diver and others fettered in chains make it clear that the jinn and devils who are 
related to have been subjected to Solomon were only human beings. See also 
34:12 footnote 3. 

b (41) The story of Job is given here as well as in the 21st chapter, being 
more brief there than here. All that the Quran states about him is that he was a 
righteous person who suffered some kind of distress, remained patient under 
trials, and was ultimately delivered from affliction. The toil and torment of which 
Job complains seem to relate to some journey of his in a desert, where he finds 
himself in an evil plight, on account of the fatigue of the journey and the thirst 
which afflicts him. There are many circumstances which point to this conclusion: 
the use of the word nusb, signifying toil or fatigue; his being led to a place where 
he finds a cool washing-place and a drink; and the mention of the devil (shaitdn) 
in connection with his trouble, for shaitdn al-fala, lit., the devil of the desert, sig- 
nifies thirst. The mention of this distressing journey of Job contains, no doubt, a 
hint to the Prophet's long journey from Makkah to Madinah, which was to be 
undertaken under particularly distressing circumstances. This journey of Job was 
undoubtedly undertaken in connection with the delivery of the message with 
which he was entrusted, just as in the case of the Holy Prophet's emigration. 

c (42) The meaning is urge your horse to go further, and the result is that 
there he finds a place where he is able to refresh himself both with drink and 
washing. He thought that he was in a waterless desert, and in reply to his prayer 
he is told to urge his horse or the beast he rode upon to trot further on, where he 
will find rest. It is a lesson not to despair under difficulties. 

d (43) The giving of his people or his family to him means that he met them 
again. The more like them with them are his followers. As I have already stated, 
there is a prophetical reference to the Prophet's Flight in Job's journey, and the 
Prophet again met not only his followers who fled from Makkah, but found also 
more like them at Madinah, i.e., the Ansar ('helpers') of Madinah.

44 And take in your hand few worldly goods and earn goodness 
therewith and do not incline to falsehood. Surely We found him 
patient; most excellent the servant! Surely he (ever) turned (to 

Us). 

45 And remember Our servants Abraham and Isaac and 
Jacob, possessors of power and insight. 46 We indeed purified them 
by a pure quality, the keeping in mind of the (final) abode. 47 And 
surely they were with Us, among the elect, the best. 48 And remem- 
ber Ishmael and Elisha and Dhu-1-Kifl; and they were all of the 
best. 

49 This is a reminder. And surely there is an excellent desti-

opened for them. ' 51 Reclining therein, calling therein for many 
fruits and drink. 52 And with them are those modest in gaze, equals 
in age.^ 53 This is what you are promised for the day of Reckoning. 
54 Surely this is Our sustenance; it will never come to an end — 
55 This (is for the good)! And surely there is an evil destination for 
the inordinate — 56 hell. They will enter it. And evil is the resting- 
place. 57 This — so let them taste it, boiling and intensely cold 
(drink), 58 and other similar (punishment), of various sorts. 59 This 



a (44) Usually these words are translated thus: "Take in your hand a branch 
and strike with it and do not break the oath". To explain these words, a story is 
added about his wife's impatience and Job's oath in that connection, but this story 
has no basis. The word dighth means not only a handful of twigs or shrubs but 
also a handful of worldly goods. The word darb (strike) carries a number of signi- 
ficances. Job was a rich man and hence he is here told not to be inclined too much 
to the attainment of worldly riches. They are only needed to the extent of enabling 
a man to earn goodness thereby. 

b (50) That is, the doors of these gardens are opened for them in this very 
life; or, they are always open to them. 

c (52) For the modest in gaze, see 37:49 footnote. Here, in addition, they are 
called equals in age, as showing that their growth begins with the growth of spiri- 
tual life in a human being, thus showing that they are the fruits of good deeds, 
whether done by males or females, who would all have these fruits equally. 

d (57) They will be made to consume intensely hot and intensely cold drink, 
because they went to the two extremes and did not follow the mean.

Surely they will burn in fire. 60 They say: Rather (it is) you — no 
welcome to you! You prepared it for us. And evil is the resting- 
place. 61 They say: Our Lord, whoever prepared it for us, give him 
more, a double, punishment in the Fire. 62 And they say: What is 
the matter with us? — we do not see men whom we used to count 
among the wicked. 63 Did we (only) take them in scorn, or do our 
eyes miss them? 64 That surely is the truth — the contending among 
themselves of the inmates of the Fire. 

Section 5: Opposition to Prophets 

65 Say: I am only a warner; and there is no god but Allah, the 
One, the Subduer (of all) — 66 the Lord of the heavens and the 
earth and all that is between them, the Mighty, the Forgiving. 
67 Say: It is a message of importance/ 68 from which you turn away. 
69 I have no knowledge of the exalted chiefs when they contend. 
70 Only this is revealed to me that I am a plain warner. 

71 When your Lord said to the angels: Surely I am going to 
create a mortal from dust." 72 So when I have made him complete 
and breathed into him of My spirit, fall down submitting to him. 
73 And the angels submitted, all of them, 74 but not IblTs.^He was 



a (59) This is the army of blind followers of falsehood. 

b (60) The speakers here are the blind followers, those addressed being the 
ringleaders. 

c (67) The message of importance is the Prophet's message to the whole of 
humanity, the message which discloses the vast spiritual realm hidden to the ordi- 
nary human eye. That those who turn away from it are doomed to perdition is the 
necessary consequence, and hence the doom of the opponents forms part of this 
message. 

d (69) The exalted chiefs are the heavenly beings who come first to know of 
the Divine decree relating to the punishment of the opponents of Truth, referred to 
in v. 68. It is these opponents that are spoken of here as contending; they carried 
on a contention against Truth. 

e (71) The creation of Adam and the submission of the angels typifies the 
raising of a prophet and the submission to him of the good and the righteous.

prevented you from submitting to him whom I created with both 
My hands? Are you proud or are you one of the exalted ones? 76 He 
said: I am better than he; You have created me of fire, and him 
You did create of dust." 77 He said: Go forth from here! surely you 
are driven away: 78 and surely My curse is on you to the day of 
Judgment. 

79 He said: My Lord, grant me respite till the day when they 
are raised. 80 He said: Surely you are granted respite, 81 till the day 
of the time made known. 82 He said: Then, by Your Might! I will 
surely lead them all astray, 83 except Your servants from among them, 
the purified ones. 84 He said: The Truth is — and the truth I speak 
— 85 that I shall fill hell with you and with all those among them 
who follow you. 

86 Say: I ask you no reward for it; nor am I one of the 
impostors. 87 It is nothing but a Reminder for the nations. And 
certainly you will come to know about it after a time. 



a (76) The creation from fire is an indication of rebelliousness, of a fiery 
temper, and the creation from dust signifies submissiveness and meekness; see 
7:12.

Chapter 39 
Ai-zumar The Companies 

The title of this chapter refers to two classes, the believers and the disbelie- 
vers (v. 71, 73). It begins by emphasizing sincere obedience to Allah and 
refers to those who obey and those who refuse to obey. Then it shows that the 
Quran is a perfect guidance whose rejectors will meet with punishment. 
Although this will not be averted from those who persist in rejection, yet the 
door of Divine mercy will remain open for even the greatest sinners who 
need not despair. At the end the chapter speaks of the coming of the judgment 
when each of the two companies is made to taste what it deserves. Chapters 
34 to 39 form one group, belonging most probably to the middle period at 
Makkah. 



Section 1 : Obedience to Allah 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the 
Wise. 2 Surely We have revealed to you the Book with truth, so 
serve Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience. 3 Now surely 
sincere obedience is due to Allah (alone). And those who choose 
protectors besides Him (say): We serve them only that they may 
bring us nearer to Allah." Surely Allah will judge between them in 
that in which they differ. Surely Allah does not guide him who is a 
liar, ungrateful. 4 If Allah desired to take a son to Himself, He 
could have chosen those He pleased out of those whom He has 



a (3) All worshippers of false deities claim that such deities are worshipped 
only to get nearer to God, as if God Himself were unapproachable. The idol- 
worshippers say that the idols are only symbols for concentration on God, while 
the Christians, plainly spoken of in the next verse, hold that without the Son they 
can have no access to God. But undue reverence of created things is a step leading 
to degradation of human nature. Hence it is that Islam requires sincere obedience 
to, or worship of, God alone. 



576 



39:5« OBEDIENCE TO ALLAH 577 

created — Glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Subduer (of 
all)." 

5 He has created the heavens and the earth with truth; He 
makes the night cover the day and makes the day overtake the 
night, and He has made the sun and the moon subservient; each 
one moves on to an assigned term. Now surely He is the Mighty, 
the Forgiver. 6 He created you from a single being, then made its 
mate of the same (kind). And He sent down for you eight of the 
cattle in pairs. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers — 
creation after creation — in triple darkness. That is Allah, your 
Lord; His is the kingdom. There is no God but He. How are you 
then turned away (from truth)? 

7 If you are ungrateful, then surely Allah is above need of you. 
And He does not like ungratefulness in His servants. And if you 
are grateful, He likes it for you. And no bearer of a burden will 
bear another's burden. Then to your Lord is your return, then will 
He inform you of what you did. Surely He is Knower of what is in 
the hearts. 8 And when distress afflicts a man he calls upon his 
Lord, turning to Him; then when He grants him a favour from Him, 
he forgets that for which he called upon Him before, and sets up 
rivals to Allah that he may cause (others) to stray from His path. 
Say: Enjoy your ungratefulness for a little, surely you are among 
the companions of the Fire. 9 Is he who is obedient during hours of 



a (4) We find the Christian doctrine referred to and refuted in very early 
Makkan revelations, such as the 19th chapter. The Quran refers to the error of 
attributing a son to the Divine Being almost as frequently as to the setting up of 
idols. It is pointed out here that no one holds a relation of sonship to Allah, but 
that it is His chosen servants that are metaphorically called His sons, because in 
being manifestations of the Divine attributes they stand to Allah in the same rela- 
tion as a son stands to a father, being images of His attributes as a son is the 
image of a father. 

b (6) The word anzala is not only applied to the actual sending down of a 
thing, but also to making it accessible to people, just as iron (57:25) and clothing 
(7:26) are spoken of as having been "sent down". It is in this sense that the cattle 
are spoken of here as being sent down for people. The eight of the cattle are the 
four pairs spoken of in 6:143-144. The four animals are mentioned particularly as 
being most useful for man.

Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord (like one who is 
ungrateful) — ? Say: Are those who know and those who do not 
know alike? Only those who have understanding are mindful. 

Section 2: Believers and Disbelievers 

10 Say: O My servants who believe, keep your duty to your 
Lord. For those who do good in this world is good, and Allah's 
earth is spacious." Truly the steadfast will be paid their reward 
without measure. n Say: I am commanded to serve Allah, being 
sincere to Him in obedience, 12 and I am commanded to be the first 
of those who submit. 13 Say: I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the 
punishment of a grievous day. 14 Say: Allah I serve, being sincere 
to Him in my obedience. 15 Serve then what you will besides Him. 
Say: The losers surely are those who lose themselves and their 
people on the day of Resurrection. Now surely that is the manifest 
loss! 16 They shall have coverings of fire above them and coverings 
beneath them. With that Allah makes His servants to fear; so keep 
your duty to Me, O My servants. 

17 And those who shun the worship of the idols and turn to 
Allah, for them is good news. So give good news to My servants, 
18 who listen to the Word, then follow the best of it. Such are they 
whom Allah has guided, and such are they who have under- 
standing. 19 He against whom the sentence of punishment is due — 
can you save him who is in the Fire? 20 But those who keep their 
duty to their Lord, for them are high places, above which are yet 
higher places, built (for them), in which rivers flow. (It is) the 
promise of Allah. Allah does not fail in (His) promise. 

21 Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the clouds, 



a (10) The words are a comfort to the Muslims, who were subjected to 
sufferings in their own land, and give them the assurance that, if suppressed in 
one land, Islam will prosper in other lands. 

b (20) This shows that in the Hereafter, and in this life as well, there is an 
unceasing progress, for the high places to which the righteous attain have places 
still higher above them.

then makes it go down into the earth in springs, then brings forth 
with it vegetation of various colours; then it withers so that you see 
it turn yellow, then He makes it chaff?" Surely there is a reminder 
in this for those who have understanding. 

Section 3: A Perfect Guidance 

22 Is he whose heart Allah has opened to Islam so that he 
follows a light from his Lord (like the hard-hearted) — ? So woe to 
those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of 
Allah! Such are in clear error. 23 Allah has revealed the best 
announcement, a Book consistent, repeating (its injunctions), at 
which do shudder the skins of those who fear their Lord, then their 
skins and their hearts soften to Allah's remembrance. This is 
Allah's guidance — He guides with it whom He pleases. And he 
whom Allah leaves in error, there is no guide for him. 

24 Is then he who has to guard himself with his own person 
against the evil punishment of the day of Resurrection (like the 
righteous) — ? And it will be said to the wrongdoers: Taste what 
you earned. 25 Those before them denied, so the punishment came 
to them from where they did not perceive. 26 So Allah made them 
taste disgrace in this world's life; and certainly the punishment of 
the Hereafter is greater, if only they knew! 



a (21) The allusion is to the fate of nations; they are brought into existence, 
made to rise, then decay and are swept out of existence. Even Muslim nations are 
subject to the same law, but Islam itself, being a law of life, is not subject to 
decay. The place of one nation that decays is taken by another. Moreover, nations 
that decay because of their transgressions may again be raised to life by turning to 
righteousness. 

b (23) The Quran was revealed by portions during a period of twenty-three 
years, and during this period the circumstances under which the Holy Prophet 
lived were of such a varied nature that the history of no other man offers a similar 
combination of varying circumstances. Yet, through all these vicissitudes, the 
Quran shows a strict uniformity. The consistency of its various parts, however, 
signifies more than a mere uniformity; it signifies that some parts explain other 
parts. It is also called repeating here because it repeats over and over again the 
most important subjects, especially the Unity of the Divine Being and the accoun- 
tability of human actions. See also 3:7.

27 And certainly We have set forth for people in this Quran 
examples of every sort that they may be mindful. a 28 An Arabic 
Quran without any crookedness, that they may guard against evil. 
29 Allah sets forth a parable: A man belonging to partners differing 
with one another, and a man (devoted) wholly to one man. Are the 
two alike in condition? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do 
not know. 30 Surely you will die and they (too) will die; 31 then 
surely on the day of Resurrection you will contend with one another 
before your Lord.

and accepts the truth — such are the dutiful. 34 They shall have 
with their Lord what they please. Such is the reward of the doers 
of good — 35 that Allah may ward off from them the worst of what 
they did, and give them their reward for the best of what they did. 

36 Is not Allah sufficient for His servant? And they seek to 
frighten you with those (whom they worship) besides Him. e And 
whomsoever Allah leaves in error, there is no guide for him.

Is not Allah Mighty, the Lord of retribution? 38 And if you ask 
them, Who created the heavens and the earth, they will say: Allah. 
Say: Do you then see that those you call upon besides Allah, 
would they, if Allah desire to afflict me with harm, remove His 



a (27) The Quran repeatedly claims to be a complete collection of the best 
teachings for the moral and spiritual welfare of mankind. Here it claims to be a 
perfect book, as not only containing all the necessary teachings, but also answer- 
ing all the objections of its opponents; see 17:89 and 25:33. 

b (35) The Quran brought about an unprecedented revolution in the world. 
People who took pride in doing evil deeds now aspired to deeds of righteousness. 
They were thus turned away from the worst deeds to the best. This verse propheti- 
cally refers to this great change. 

c (36) The superstitious Arabs no doubt believed that their idols could do 
harm to people who did not admit their authority. 



39:39* PUNISHMENT CANNOT BE AVERTED 581 

harm? Or if He desire to show me mercy, could they withhold His 
mercy? Say: Allah is sufficient for me. On Him do the reliant rely. 
39 Say: My people, work in your place. Surely I am a worker, so 
you will soon come to know, 40 who it is to whom a punishment 
comes, disgracing him, and on whom falls a lasting punishment." 

41 Surely We have revealed to you the Book with truth for 
(the good of) people. So whoever goes aright, it is for his own 
soul, and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to its detriment. 
And you are not in charge of them. 

Section 5: Punishment cannot be averted 

42 Allah takes souls (of human beings) at the time of their 
death, and of those that do not die (He takes) during their sleep. 
Then He withholds those on whom He has passed the decree of 
death and sends the others back till an appointed time.' Surely 
there are signs in this for a people who reflect. 43 0r, do they take 
intercessors besides Allah? Say: What! Even though they control 
nothing, nor do they understand. 44 Say: Allah's is the intercession 
altogether. His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Then 
to Him you will be returned. 

45 And when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who 
do not believe in the Hereafter shrink, and when those besides 
Him are mentioned, lo! they are joyful. c 46 Say: O Allah, Originator 
of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, 



a (40) Two kinds of punishment are plainly spoken of, viz., the punishment 
that will bring disgrace, which is clearly the punishment of this life, and the last- 
ing punishment that the wicked receive in the life after death. The first of these 
demonstrates the truth of the other. 

b (42) It is clear that it is not the animal soul that is taken away in sleep; it is 
the soul that stands for human consciousness. In death both are taken away. The 
statement further makes it clear that the word tawaffa is applied to the taking of 
the soul and not to the removal of the body from one place to another. See also 
21:95 and 23 TOO. 

c (45) Elsewhere the Quran says: "And most of them do not believe in Allah 
without setting up partners (with Him)" (12:106).

You will judge between Your servants in that in which they differ. 
47 And if those who do wrong had all that is in the earth and as 
much as it again, they would certainly offer it as ransom from the 
evil of the punishment on the day of Resurrection. And what they 
never thought of shall become plain to them from Allah." 48 And 
the evil (consequences) of what they earned will become plain to 
them, and what they mocked at will beset them. 

49 So when harm afflicts man he calls upon Us; then, when 
We grant him a favour from Us, he says: I have been given it only 
by means of (my) knowledge. No, it is a trial, but most of them do 
not know. 50 Those before them did say it indeed, but what they 
earned did not avail them. 51 So the evil which they had earned 
befell them. And those who do wrong from among these, the evil 
which they earn shall befall them (also), and they shall not escape/ 
52 Do they not know that Allah amplifies provision for whom He 
pleases, and restricts (it also); surely there are signs in this for a 
people who believe. 

Section 6: Divine Mercy 

53 Say: O My servants who have been reckless against their 
own souls, do not despair of the mercy of Allah; surely Allah 
forgives sins altogether. He is indeed the Forgiving, the Merciful.^ 
54 And turn to your Lord and submit to Him before punishment 



a (47) What they never thought of signifies the overthrow of their power in 
this life and the manifestation of the evil results of their deeds in the Hereafter. 

b (48) The fact that the heaven and hell of the next life are only manifes- 
tations of the spiritual realities of this life is stated here in clear language. The evil 
consequences of what they do are hidden from the eye in this life, but they shall 
become plain in the next life. 

c (51) Wonderful indeed is the certainty of the tone in which these pro- 
phecies are worded, when all around there was not a single ray of hope for Islam, 
and its enemies were in the ascendant. 

d (53) Stress is laid on the mercy and love of Allah in all religions, but these 
great Divine attributes find their true and final expression in Islam. This verse 
discloses the all-comprehensive mercy of Allah, before which the sins of people 
become quite insignificant.

comes to you, then you will not be helped. 55 And follow the best 
that has been revealed to you from your Lord" before punishment 
comes to you all of a sudden, while you do not perceive — 56 that a 
soul should say: O woe is me! that I fell short of my duty to Allah, 
and surely I was one of those who scoffed; 57 or it should say: If 
Allah had guided me, I should have been dutiful, 58 or it should 
say, when it sees the punishment: If I had another chance I should 
be a doer of good. 59 Yes, My messages did come to you, but you 
rejected them, and were proud and were among the disbelievers. 

60 And on the day of Resurrection you will see those who lied 
against Allah, their faces will be darkened. Is there not in hell an 
abode for the proud? 61 And Allah delivers those who keep their 
duty with their achievement — harm does not touch them, nor do 
they grieve. 62 AUah is the Creator of all things and He has charge 
over everything. 63 His are the treasures of the heavens and the 
earth. And those who disbelieve in the messages of Allah, such 
are the losers. 

Section 7: The Final Judgment 

64 Say: Do you tell me to serve others than Allah, you igno- 
rant ones? 65 And certainly it has been revealed to you and to those 
before you: If you set up partners (with Allah), your work would 
surely come to nothing and you would be a loser. 66 No, serve 
Allah alone and be one of the thankful. 

67 And they do not honour Allah with the honour due to Him; 
and the whole earth will be in His grip on the day of Resurrection 
and the heavens rolled up in His right hand. Glory be to Him, and 
supremely exalted is He above what they set up as partners (with 
Him)! 68 And the trumpet is blown, so all those in the heavens and 
all those in the earth will swoon, except such as Allah please. 
Then it will be blown again, when lo! they stand up, awaiting. 



a (55) Best stands for the revelation of the Quran. God has ever been reveal- 
ing His will to mankind, but the Quran, being the final expression of His will, is 
the best revelation that has been sent to people. 

b (68) See 6:73 footnote 2. Here it is stated that the trumpet is blown twice: 



584 39. THE COMPANIES • 39 : 69 

69 And the earth beams with the light of its Lord, and the Book is 
laid down, and the prophets and the witnesses are brought up, and 
judgment is given between them with justice, and they are not 
wronged." 70 And every soul is paid back fully for what it did, and 
He knows best what they do. 

Section 8: Each Group meets with its Desert 

71 And those who disbelieve are driven to hell in companies; 
until, when they come to it, its doors are opened, and its keepers 
say to them: Did not messengers come to you from among you 
reciting to you the messages of your Lord and warning you of the 
meeting of this day of yours? They say: Yes indeed. But the word 
of punishment proved true against the disbelievers. 72 It is said: 
Enter the gates of hell to abide in it; and evil is the abode of the 
proud. 

73 And those who keep their duty to their Lord are conveyed 
to the Garden in companies until, when they come to it, its doors 
are opened and its keepers say to them: Peace be on you, you led 
pure lives; so enter it to abide. 74 And they say: Praise be to Allah! 
Who has made good to us His promise, and He has made us 
inherit the land; we abide in the Garden where we please. How 
excellent is the reward of the workers! 75 And you see the angels 

at the first blowing all swoon, and at the second blowing they all stand up, awaiting 
to receive the judgment. A general destruction is thus followed by a resurrection. 
In the case of the spiritual resurrection, the destruction signifies the destruction of 
the old order. 

a (69) The beaming of the earth with the light of its Lord in the Resurrection 
is in reference to the clear manifestation of the consequences of the deeds which 
remain generally hidden in this life. The laying down of the Book refers to the 
passing of the judgment on the good and the evil according to their deserts. The 
prophets and the witnesses are brought up, these being the people who sow the 
seeds of virtue and turn people's minds to God. Prophets were sent to every nation, 
and the followers of the Prophet Muhammad, who take the place of the previous 
prophets in turning people's minds to God, are the witnesses spoken of here; they 
are specially mentioned by this name in 2:143. A deeper reference to the spiritual 
resurrection is evident throughout.

circumstances. The day must come, we are here told, when the believers will 
praise God for making them inherit the land. Within fifteen years of this prophecy 
they were made masters of Arabia, and within another five they were made to 
inherit the Holy Land. Note, further, how the prophecies of triumph in this life are 
combined with the Resurrection in which the righteous are to receive the mighty 
spiritual blessings in full manifestation. 



Chapter 40 
Ai-Mu'min The Belie ver 

The title of this chapter is taken from the mention of a believer in Moses from 
among Pharaoh's people (v. 28) who pleaded for Moses when Pharaoh wanted 
to kill him. Chapters 40 to 46 form a group all beginning with the letters Ha 
Mini, and belong to the middle period at Makkah when persecution of Muslims 
had begun. These chapters offer solace to Muslims, warn their persecutors 
and foretell the triumph of truth over opposition. This chapter begins with the 
mention of the Divine plan for the protection of the faithful and goes on to 
speak of the eventual failure of the opponents. This warning is illustrated from 
the history of Moses. The chapter then reiterates that prophets of God and 
believers in them are always helped against their opponents, it mentions that 
nothing is impossible before the power of Allah and warns the disbelievers 
that their opposition to the truth will end in failure. 



Section 1 : Protection of the Faithful 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Beneficent God! a 2 The revelation of the Book is from Allah, 
the Mighty, the Knowing, 3 Forgiver of sin and Acceptor of repen- 
tance, Severe to punish, Lord of bounty.* There is no God but He; 
to Him is the eventual coming. 

4 None dispute concerning the messages of Allah but those 
who disbelieve, so do not let their control in the land deceive you. 
5 Before them the people of Noah and the parties after them rejec- 
ted (prophets), and every nation purposed against its messenger to 
destroy him, and disputed by means of falsehood to refute thereby 



a (1) This verse consists of the two letters ha and mini. These may stand for 
the Divine name Al-Rahman, i.e. the Beneficent. They may also be abbreviations 
for Hamid (Praised) and Majid (Glorious), or for Hayy (the Living) and Qayyum 
(the Self-subsisting), or for Rahman (Beneficent) and Rahim (Merciful). 

b (3) Of the four attributes, the first two and the last refer to Divine forgive- 
ness, mercy and bounty, while only one refers to punishment of evil, and thus the 
attribute of mercy preponderates even when punishment is spoken of.

the truth, so I seized them; how (terrible) was then My retribution! 
6 And thus did the word of jour Lord prove true against those who 
disbelieve, that they are the companions of the Fire. 

7 Those who bear the Throne of Power and those around it 
celebrate the praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask pro- 
tection for those who believe:" Our Lord, You embrace all things 
in mercy and knowledge, ' so protect those who turn (to You) and 
follow Your way, and save them from the punishment of hell. 
8 Our Lord, make them enter the Gardens of perpetuity, which You 
have promised them and such of their fathers and their wives and 
their offspring as are good. e Surely You are the Mighty, the Wise; 
'and guard them from evil, and whom You guard from evil this 
day, You have indeed mercy on him. And that is the mighty 
achievement. 

Section 2: Failure of Opponents 

10 Those who disbelieve are told: Certainly Allah's hatred (of 
you), when you were called upon to the faith and you rejected, 
was much greater than your hatred (now) of yourselves.'' n They 
say: Our Lord, twice have You made us die, and twice have You 
given us life; 6 so we confess our sins. Is there then a way of escape? 



a (7-1) Those who bear the 'arsh or the Throne of Power are not the bearers 
of any material thing; see 7:54 footnote 2, for 'arsh. Generally the words are ex- 
plained as meaning angels, but may refer to bearers of Divine messages, i.e., the 
prophets, while those around it are the faithful who, walking in the footsteps of 
the prophets, carry the Divine message to the world. See also 69:17 footnote. 

b (7-2) Here we are told that Divine mercy is as comprehensive as Divine 
knowledge, and they both extend over all things. 

c (8) The wives and offspring of the faithful, those of them who do good, are 
here mentioned as entering paradise along with them. 

d (10) The violent hatred referred to is the hatred of the evildoers for them- 
selves, when the evil consequences of their evil deeds become manifest to them. 
How much greater must have been the hatred of Allah, the Fountain-head of 
purity, for them when they committed those deeds ! How Forbearing and Merciful 
was He not to visit them with immediate punishment! 

e (11) The first state of death is the state of nothingness from which man is 
brought into existence, the second life being the life after death.

12 That is because when Allah alone was called upon, you dis- 
believed, and when partners were set up with Him, you believed. 
So judgment belongs to Allah, the High, the Great. 

13 He it is Who shows you His signs and sends down for you 
sustenance from heaven," and none is mindful but he who turns (to 
Him). 14 So call upon Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience, 
though the disbelievers are averse — 15 Exalter of degrees, Lord of 
the Throne of Power, He casts the spirit by His command upon 
whom He pleases of His servants, that he may warn (people) of 
the day of Meeting — 16 the day when they come forth. Nothing 
concerning them remains hidden from Allah. c To whom belongs 
the kingdom this day? To Allah, the One, the Subduer (of all). 
17 This day every soul is rewarded for what it has earned. No 
injustice this day! Surely Allah is Swift in Reckoning. 

18 And warn them of the day that draws near, when hearts, 
grieving inwardly, rise up to the throats. The wrongdoers will 
have no friend, nor any intercessor who should be obeyed. 19 He 
knows the dishonesty of eyes and what the hearts conceal. 20 And 
Allah judges with truth. And those whom they call upon besides 
Him judge not at all! Surely Allah is the Hearing, the Seeing. 

Section 3: A Warning in Moses' History 

21 Have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the 
end of those who were before them? Mightier than these were 



a (13) The meaning is simply that God provides the means of sustenance; or, 
the sustenance from heaven means the spiritual sustenance. 

b (15) The riih (spirit) is here spoken of as being granted only to the elect, 
and the object is to warn people; hence riih means Divine revelation, not the soul 
which is given to every human being. By the day of Meeting is meant the day of 
meeting with God. 

c (16) It is implied that the hidden consequences of deeds will be made 
manifest on that day, for from Allah nothing is hidden. 

d (18) In the day that draws near, the nearer punishment of this life is 
spoken of. The verse depicts the state of the hearts of the disbelievers on the day 
of their vanquishment. 



40:22' A WARNING IN MOSES' HISTORY 589 

they in strength and in fortifications in the land, but Allah des- 
troyed them for their sins. And they had none to protect them from 
Allah. 22 That was because their messengers had come to them 
with clear arguments, but they disbelieved, so Allah destroyed 
them. Surely He is Strong, Severe in retribution. 

23 And certainly We sent Moses with Our messages and clear 
authority, 24 to Pharaoh and Haman and Korah," but they said: A 
lying enchanter! 25 So when he brought to them the Truth from Us, 
they said: Kill the sons of those who believe with him and keep 
their women alive. And the plot of the disbelievers is bound to 
fail. 26 And Pharaoh said: Leave me to kill Moses and let him call 
upon his Lord. Surely I fear that he will change your religion or 
that he will make mischief to appear in the land. 27 And Moses 
said: Truly I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every 
proud one who does not believe in the day of Reckoning. 

Section 4: A Believer of Pharaoh's People 

28 And a believing man of Pharaoh's people, who hid his 
faith, said: Will you kill a man because he says, My Lord is Allah, 
and indeed he has brought you clear arguments from your Lord? 
And if he is a liar, on him will be his lie, but if he is truthful, some 
of what he threatens you with will afflict you. c Surely Allah does 
not guide one who exceeds all bounds, a liar. 29 My people, yours 
is the kingdom this day, being masters in the land, but who will 
help us against the punishment of Allah, if it comes to us? Pharaoh 
said: I only show you what I see and I guide you only to the right 
way. 



a (24) The words do not indicate that the message to Pharaoh and Haman 
and Korah was given at one and the same time. All that is meant is that these three 
were the chief men who did not accept his message and they were destroyed. 

b (25) A perusal of the verses that follow will show that the speaker here is 
only Pharaoh, as advised by his chiefs, both he and Haman being mentioned by 
name, the latter in v. 36, while no mention is made of Korah. 

c (28) Some of what they are threatened with, will afflict them, because the 
mercy of Allah wards off some of the deserved punishment. 



590 40. THE BELIEVER • 40 : 30 

30 And he who believed said: My people, surely I fear for you 
the like of what befell the parties, 31 the like of what befell the 
people of Noah and Ad and Thamud and those after them. a And 
Allah wishes no injustice for (His) servants. 32 And, my people, I 
fear for you the day of Calling out — 33 the day on which you 
will turn back retreating, having none to save you from Allah; and 
whomsoever Allah leaves in error there is no guide for him. 34 And 
Joseph indeed came to you before with clear arguments, but you 
ever remained in doubt as to what he brought you; until, when he 
died, you said: Allah will never raise a messenger after him. Thus 
does Allah leave him in error who exceeds all bounds, a doubter 
— 35 those who dispute concerning the messages of Allah without 
any authority that has come to them. Greatly hated is it by Allah 
and by those who believe. Thus does Allah seal every heart, of a 
proud, insolent one. 

36 And Pharaoh said: Haman, build for me a tower that I may 
attain the means of access — 37 the means of access to the heavens, 
then reach the God of Moses, and I surely think him to be liar. e 
And thus the evil of his deed was made to seem good to Pharaoh, 
and he was turned aside from the way. And the plot of Pharaoh 
ended only in ruin. 

Section 5: The End of Pharaoh's People 

38 And he who believed said: My people, follow me, I will 
guide you to the right way. 39 My people, this life of the world is 
but a (passing) enjoyment, and the Hereafter, that is the abode to 
settle. 40 Whoever does evil, he is recompensed only with its like; 
and whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, 



a (31) There is nothing extraordinary in an Egyptian knowing how certain 
people on the borders of Arabia perished. 

b (32) The day of calling out to one another is the day of distress on which 
one will call out to the other for help, none being able to help himself or another. 
Every day of distress is the day of calling out, and the description need not be 
limited to the day of Judgment. 

c (37) As Moses spoke of the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Pharaoh 
mocked at the idea by suggesting that he would build a tower to find Moses' God. 



40 : 41 • THE END OF PHARAOH'S PEOPLE 591 

these shall enter the Garden, to be given sustenance in it without 
measure. 41 And my people, how is it that I call you to salvation 
and you call me to the Fire? 42 You call me to disbelieve in Allah 
and to set up with Him partners of which I have no knowledge, 
and I call you to the Mighty, the Forgiving. 43 Without doubt, what 
you call me to has no claim to being invoked in this world, or in 
the Hereafter, and our return is to Allah, and those who exceed all 
bounds are companions of the Fire. 44 So you will remember what I 
say to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah. Surely Allah is Seer of 
the servants. 

45 So Allah protected him from the evil that they planned; 
and evil punishment befell Pharaoh's people — 46 the Fire. They 
are brought before it (every) morning and evening, and on the day 
when the Hour comes to pass: Make Pharaoh's people enter the 
most severe punishment. 

47 And when they contend with one another in the Fire, the 
weak saying to those who were proud: Surely we were your follo- 
wers; will you then avert from us a portion of the Fire? 48 Those 
who were proud say: Now we are all in it, Allah has indeed judged 
between the servants. 49 And those in the Fire will say to the keepers 
of hell: Pray to your Lord to lighten our punishment for a day. 
50 They will say: Did not your messengers come to you with clear 
arguments? They will say: Yes, indeed. They will say: Then pray. 
And the prayer of the disbelievers only goes astray. 

Section 6: Messengers receive Divine Help 

51 We certainly help Our messengers, and those who believe, 
in this world's life and on the day when the witnesses arise a — 
52 the day on which their excuse will not benefit the unjust, and for 
them is a curse and for them is the evil abode. 

53 And We indeed gave Moses the guidance, and We made 



a (51) The emphatic promise that the Prophet will be helped in this life, too, 
was made at a time when he was being persecuted, and there was not the least 
indication that his powerful opponents would be vanquished.

reminder for those who have understanding. 55 So be patient; sure- 
ly the promise of Allah is true; and ask protection for your sin" 
and celebrate the praise of your Lord in the evening and the 
morning. 

56 Those who dispute about the messages of Allah without 
any authority having come to them, there is nothing in their hearts 
but (a desire) to become great, which they will never attain. So 
seek refuge in Allah. Surely He is the Hearing, the Seeing. 
57 Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater 
than the creation of mankind; but most people do not know. 
58 And the blind and the seeing are not alike, nor those who believe 
and do good and the evildoers. Little mindful are you! 59 The Hour 
is surely coming — there is no doubt in it — but most people do 
not believe. 60 And your Lord says: Pray to Me, I will answer you. 
Those who disdain My service will surely enter hell, humiliated. 

Section 7: The Power of Allah 

61 Allah is He Who made for you the night for resting in and 
the day for seeing. Surely Allah is full of grace to mankind, but 



a (55) These words, occurring here and in 47:19, do not negative the claim 
made repeatedly that the Prophet was sinless. Five times the Holy Prophet is des- 
cribed in the Quran as being one who purified others from sin (2:129, 2:151, 
3:164, 9:103, 62:2). How could a sinful man purify others from sins? Again, he is 
repeatedly spoken of as walking in the way of perfect righteousness and entire 
submission to Allah. In fact, the Quran does not allow us to attribute sin to any 
prophet: "They do not speak before He speaks, and according to His command 
they act" (21:27). 

The words used here (istighfar and dhanb) not only signify asking for for- 
giveness of sins, but also asking for covering of sin, which is really the seeking of 
protection against sin. What the Prophet is asked to seek is a protection from the 
imperfections of human nature, which make a person liable to sin unless he is 
protected by Allah. (Editor 's Note: It may be the reader of the Quran who is pri- 
marily addressed in the words of this verse.) 

b (57) Man is insignificant as compared with the vast creation of the heavens 
and the earth, yet he considers himself so great that he would not bow his head 
before the great Creator of this vast creation. 



40 : 62 • THE POWER OF ALLAH 593 

most people do not give thanks. 62 That is Allah, your Lord, the 
Creator of all things. There is no God but He. How are you then 
turned away (from truth)! 63 Thus are turned away those who deny 
the messages of Allah. 

64 Allah is He Who made the earth a resting-place for you 
and the heaven a structure, and He formed you, then made goodly 
your forms, and He provided you with good things. That is Allah, 
your Lord — so blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds. 65 He is 
the Living, there is no God but He; so call on Him, being sincere 
to Him in obedience. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds! 

66 Say: I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon 
besides Allah, when clear arguments have come to me from my 
Lord; and I am commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds. 
67 He it is Who created you from dust, then from a small life -germ, 
then from a clot, then He brings you forth as a child, then that you 
may attain your maturity, then that you may be old; and of you are 
some who die before and that you may reach an appointed term, 
and that you may understand. 68 He it is Who gives life and causes 
death, so when He decrees an affair, He only says to it, Be, and it 
is. 

Section 8: The End of Opposition 

69 Do you not see those who dispute concerning the messages 
of Allah? How are they turned away (from truth)! — 70 those who 
reject the Book and that with which We have sent Our messen- 
gers. But they shall soon know. 71 When the fetters are on their 
necks and the chains. They are dragged 72 into hot water; then in 
the Fire they are burned. 73 Then it is said to them: Where are those 
that you used to set up (as gods) 74 besides Allah? They will say: 
They have failed us; rather, we did not call upon anything before. 
Thus does Allah make the disbelievers perplexed. 

75 That is because you exulted in the land unjustly and 
because you behaved insolently. 76 Enter the gates of hell to abide

of what We promise them, or cause you to die (before it), to Us

shall they be returned." 78 And certainly We sent messengers before 
you — among them are those We have mentioned to you and 
among them are those We have not mentioned to you. Nor was it 
possible for a messenger to bring a sign except with Allah's 
permission; so when Allah's command comes, judgment is given 
with truth, and those who treat (it) as a lie are lost. 

Section 9: The End of Opposition 

79 Allah is He Who made the cattle for you that you may ride 
on some of them, and some of them you eat. 80 And there are 
advantages in them for you, and that you may attain through them 
(many) a need which is in your hearts, and on them and on ships 
you are borne. 81 And He shows you His signs; which then of 
Allah's signs will you deny? 

82 Do they not travel in the land and see what was the end of 
those before them? They were more numerous than these and 
greater in strength and in fortifications in the land, but what they 
earned did not avail them. 83 Then when their messengers came to 
them with clear arguments, they exulted in whatever knowledge 
they (already) had, and what they used to deride befell them. 84 So 
when they saw Our punishment, they said: We believe in Allah 
alone, and we deny what we used to set up as partners with Him. 
85 But their faith could not benefit them when they saw Our 
punishment. Such is Allah's law, which ever takes its course in 
the matter of His servants; and there the disbelievers are lost. 



a (77) This only emphasizes that they must suffer the evil consequences of 
their deeds, whether the Prophet lives to see their punishment or dies before it. 

b (80) That is, they are of use to you in carrying your burdens and yourselves 
from one place to another, and serve other needs. 



Chapter 41 

Ha Mint 

• 

This chapter bears the name of its initial letters Ha MTm and is also known as 
Ha MTm Sajdah. It is also called Fussilat, meaning something made plain, 
from the occurrence of this word in v. 3. Chapters 40 to 46 form one group; 
see the introductory note to chapter 40. This chapter opens with an invitation 
to the truth, followed by a warning against its rejection and a mention of the 
evidence of man's own faculties against the rejection of truth. Then it shows 
that believers are strengthened by inspiration and that revelation gives life to 
those who are spiritually dead. Finally, it is stated that if warnings and 
arguments are not heeded, the doom is inevitable and the truth will spread 
gradually. 



Section 1 : Invitation to the Truth 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Beneficent God! 2 A revelation from the Beneficent, the 
Merciful. 3 A Book of which the verses are made plain, an Arabic 
Quran for a people who know — 4 good news and a warning. But 
most of them turn away, so they do not hear. 5 And they say: Our 
hearts are under coverings from that to which you call us, and 
there is a deafness in our ears, and there is a veil between us and 
you" so act, we too are acting. 

6 Say: I am only a mortal like you. It is revealed to me that 
your God is one God, so keep in the straight path to Him, and ask 
His protection. And woe to those who set up partners (with Allah), 
7 who do not give the due charity, and who are disbelievers in the 
Hereafter! "Those who believe and do good, for them is surely a 
reward never to be cut off. 



a (5) The coverings of the hearts, the deafness of the ears and the hanging of 
the veils are used simply to indicate their own determined rejection of the Truth. 
They resolved neither to open their hearts, in case the Truth should enter them, 
nor to lend their ears so that they might even hear the preaching of the Prophet.

Section 2: The Warning 

9 Say: Do you indeed disbelieve in Him Who created the 
earth in two periods, and do you set up equals with Him? That is 
the Lord of the worlds. 10 And He made in it mountains above its 
surface, and He placed blessings in it and ordained in it its foods, 
in four periods;" alike for (all) seekers. n Then He directed Him- 
self to the heaven and it was a vapour, so He said to it and to the 
earth: Come both, willingly or unwillingly. They both said: We 
come willingly. e 12 So He ordained them seven heavens in two 
periods, and revealed in every heaven its affair. And We adorned 
the lower heaven with lights, and (made it) to guard. 6 That is the 
decree of the Mighty, the Knowing. 

13 But if they turn away, then say: I warn you of a scourge 
like the scourge of Ad and Thamud. 14 When messengers came to 



a (10-1) For the creation of the heavens and the earth in six periods of time, 
see 7:54; the word yaum (period) here does not mean a day of 24 hours but in fact 
stands for a stage in growth. The making of the earth in two periods and the making 
on it of the mountains, rivers and of plant and animal life in four periods is really 
one continuous process, of six stages in all: (1) the throwing off of the cosmic 
matter called the earth; (2) the cooling of its surface; (3) the making of the moun- 
tains; (4) blessing it by waters and making in it rivers; (5-6) the ordaining of foods, 
being, in the first place, the growth of plant life and, in the second, the growth of 
animal life, culminating in the creation of man. Even the earlier commentators 
note that the creation in six yaum does not refer to six days as the time actually 
taken in making the heavens and the earth, which is still going on. 

b (10-2) The meaning is that the foods which are made in the earth are 
equally accessible to all seekers (human beings as well as animals of all kinds). 

c (11) Heaven is here plainly spoken of as being originally dukhan, meaning 
smoke, vapour or gaseous matter. The command to creation to come willingly or 
unwillingly is a reference to the Divine laws working in nature. Everything crea- 
ted, whether in the heavens or the earth, is subject to law. The existence of one 
law throughout the universe is clear evidence of the existence of One God, the 
Maker of that law. 

d (12-1) As in the case of the earth, we are told that the heavenly bodies, too, 
were created in two stages. The creation of heavenly bodies is thus subject to the 
same law. For the seven heavens, see 2:29. The words, and revealed in every 
heaven its affair, show that everything created in nature serves a purpose. 

e (12-2) See 37:7.

them from before them and behind them," saying, Serve nothing 
but Allah, they said: If our Lord had pleased, He would have sent 
down angels. So we are disbelievers in that with which you are 
sent. 15 Then as to Ad, they were unjustly proud in the land, and 
said: Who is mightier in power than we? Do they not see that 
Allah Who created them is mightier in power than they? And they 
denied Our messages. 16 So We sent on them a furious wind in 
unlucky days that We might make them taste the punishment of 
disgrace in this world's life. And the punishment of the Hereafter 
is truly more disgracing, and they will not be helped. 17 And as for 
Thamud, We showed them the right way, but they preferred blind- 
ness to guidance, so the scourge of a humiliating punishment 
overtook them for what they had earned. 18 And We delivered 
those who believed and kept their duty. 

Section 3: Man's Evidence against Himself 

19 And the day when the enemies of Allah are gathered to the 
Fire, they will be formed into groups. 20 Until, when they come to 
it, their ears and their eyes and their skins will bear witness 
against them as to what they did. ' 21 And they will say to their 
skins: Why do you bear witness against us? They will say: Allah 
Who makes everything speak has made us speak, and He created 
you at first, and to Him you are returned. 22 And you did not cover 
yourselves that your ears and your eyes and your skins should not 
bear witness against you, but you thought that Allah did not know 
much of what you did. 23 And that, your (evil) thought which you 
entertained about your Lord, ruined you, so have you become 
losers. 



a (14) The coming of the prophets from before and behind signifies their 
impressing the truth of their message upon their people in every possible way. 
Some understand the coming of the prophets from near and from far. 

b (20) The bearing of witness by the ears and the eyes and the skin shows the 
truth of the law that the consequences of evil deeds will become manifest. 
(Editor 's Note: Modern science has shown that, in this very life, parts of a 
person's body and samples taken from it can disclose information about, or bear 
witness against, the deeds that he committed.)

24 Then if they are patient, the Fire is their abode. And if they 
ask for goodwill, they are not among those who are granted 
goodwill. a 25 And We have appointed for them comrades, so they 
make seem good to them what is before them and what is behind 
them, and the word proved true against them among the nations of 
jinn and people that have passed away before them: they are 
surely losers. 

Section 4: Believers strengthened 

26 And those who disbelieve say: Do not listen to this Quran 
but make noise therein, perhaps you may overcome. 27 So We shall 
certainly make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment, 
and We shall certainly recompense them for the worst of what 
they did. 28 That is the reward of Allah's enemies — the Fire. They 
shall have in it the home to abide — a recompense for their deny- 
ing Our messages. 29 And those who disbelieve will say: Our Lord, 
show us those who led us astray from among jinn and people that 
we may trample them under our feet, so that they may be among 
the lowest. 

30 Those who say, Our Lord is Allah, then continue in the 
right way, the angels descend upon them saying: Do not fear, nor 
grieve, and receive good news of the Garden which you were 
promised. 31 We are your friends in this world's life and in the 
Hereafter, and you have in it what your souls desire and you have 
in it what you ask for. c 32 A welcome gift from the Forgiving, the 
Merciful. 



a (24) God's goodwill can be gained in this life, and for those who waste 
that opportunity here the only way to that goodwill is to go through the ordeal of 
Fire. 

b (25) These comrades are wicked companions. 

c (31) Verses 30 and 31 show that it is in this life that the angels descend 
upon the faithful, giving them the joyful news that they should not have any fear. 
In fact, it is here, when the faithful are persecuted and oppressed, and when the 
powers of evil seem to have the upper hand, that such assurances are most needed, 
and it is here that the angels give them comfort and strength to bear hardships, and 
thus they ultimately overcome the forces of evil. 



41 : 33 • EFFECT OF THE REVELATION 599 

Section 5 : Effect of the Revelation 

33 And who is better in speech than one who calls to Allah 
and does good, and says: I am surely one of those who submit? 
34 And not alike are the good and the evil. Repel (evil) with what is 
best, when lo! he between whom and you is enmity would be as if 
he were a warm friend." 35 And none is granted it but those who 
are patient, and none is granted it but the owner of a mighty good 
fortune. 36 And if a false imputation from the devil afflict you, seek 
refuge in Allah. Surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing. 

37 And of His signs are the night and the day and the sun and 
the moon. Do not adore the sun nor the moon, but adore Allah 
Who created them, if He it is that you serve. 38 But if they are 
proud, yet those with your Lord glorify Him night and day, and 
they do not tire. 39 And of His signs is this, that you see the earth 
still, but when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells. He 
Who gives it life is surely the Giver of life to the dead. e Surely He 
is Powerful over all things. 

40 Those who distort Our messages are not hidden from Us. 
Is he then who is cast into the Fire better or he who comes safe on 
the day of Resurrection? Do what you like, surely He is Seer of 
what you do. 41 Those who disbelieve in the Reminder when it 
comes to them, and surely it is an Invincible Book: 42 falsehood 



a (34) Editor's Note: Verses 33-35 show that Muslims should preach Islam 
by means of speech and not force, by setting an example themselves of doing 
good deeds, and by responding to evil with good. This approach requires patience 
and is a great good fortune (v. 35). Thus do you win over your enemy. 

b (36) The previous verses teach the repelling of evil with good. This verse 
suggests another remedy for evil. The Prophet is here told that, if his work is 
interfered with by evildoers or if false imputations are made against him, he 
should seek refuge in Allah, and Divine help, which always comes to the right- 
eous, will make truth triumphant. 

c (39) The still earth signifies land dried up and without vegetation; its 
stirring indicates its moving with life and its swelling the producing of vegetation. 
This is entirely metaphorical, indicating that when Divine revelation comes it gives 
a new life to people. The effect of rain upon earth is likened to the effect of the 
Quran upon the hearts of people. Dead here are the spiritually dead. 



600 41.HAMIM '41:43 

cannot come at it from before or behind it — a revelation from the 
Wise, the Praised One. 43 Nothing is said to you but what was said 
to messengers before you. Surely your Lord is the Lord of forgive- 
ness and the Lord of painful retribution. 

44 And if We had made it a Quran in a foreign tongue, they 
would have said: Why have not its messages been made clear? 
What! a foreign (tongue) and an Arab! a Say: It is to those who 
believe a guidance and a healing, and those who do not believe, 
there is a deafness in their ears and it is obscure to them. These are 
called to from a place afar. 

Section 6: Gradual Spread of Truth 

45 And indeed We gave Moses the Book, but differences 
arose concerning it. And if a word had not already gone forth from 
your Lord, judgment would have been given between them. And 
surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it. 46 Whoever does 
good, it is for the good of his own soul; and whoever does evil, it 
is to its detriment. And your Lord is not in the least unjust to the 
servants. 



£P 47 To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. And no 

«■ fruit comes forth from its coverings, nor does a female bear or 

v&gt; give birth but with His knowledge. And on the day when He calls 

out to them: Where are My partners, they will say: We declare to 

You, not one of us can bear witness. 48 And those whom they 



a (44-1) There seems to be a reference here to the prophecies which spoke of 
the coming of an Ishmaelite or an Arab prophet. The reference to Moses in the 
next verse confirms this, because Moses spoke plainly of a prophet like himself 
appearing from among the brethren of the Israelites, who are the Ishmaelites. 

b (44-2) The Quran is here called a healing because it was a remedy for the 
spiritual diseases which prevailed in the world. It is the book which found a 
nation affected with the worst possible spiritual and moral diseases, and within 
less than a quarter of a century cleansed a whole country and a whole nation of all 
those diseases. Its healing effect, however, has not been limited to Arabia, and 
today there is no people on earth that does not bear witness to the great healing 
power of the Quran, which is so far-reaching in its effect that non-Muslims have 
benefited by it equally with Muslims. 



41:49* GRADUAL SPREAD OF TRUTH 601 

called upon before will fail them, and they will know that they 
cannot escape. 

49 Man does not tire of praying for good, but, if evil touches 
him, he is despairing, hopeless. 50 And if We make him taste mercy 
from Us after distress has touched him, he says: This is due to 
me," and I do not think that the Hour will ever come; and if I am 
sent back to my Lord, I shall have sure good with Him. So We 
shall certainly inform those who disbelieve of what they do, and 
We shall make them taste of hard punishment. 51 And when We 
show favour to man, he turns away and withdraws himself; but 
when evil touches him, he is full of lengthy supplications. 

52 Say: Do you see, if it is from Allah, then you disbelieve in 
it, who is in greater error than he who is in opposition far away? 
53 We will soon show them Our signs in farthest regions and 
among their own people, until it is quite clear to them that it is 
the Truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is a Witness over all 
things? 54 Now surely they are in doubt as to the meeting with their 
Lord. Now surely He encompasses all things. 



a (50) The words indicate man's ungratefulness for Divine blessings. He 
does not recognize Divine goodness in those gifts, but says "this is due to me", 
i.e., I have obtained it by my own exertion and I deserve it. And then he denies 
the Judgment. 

b (53) The word afaq means borders or extremeties of the earth, or its remote 
sides, and the great message conveyed here is that Islam will spread to the most 
distant regions of the earth, the words their own people denoting the Arabs. What 
is stated here is that Islam will quickly spread, not only in Arabia but in the remote 
regions of the earth, and this prophecy is contained in a chapter revealed early at 
Makkah, when Muslims were being severely persecuted and the message of Islam 
had apparently little hope of finding acceptance anywhere. If the prophecy is so 
clear, its fulfilment is clearer still. Within twenty years of its birth, Islam spread 
through the whole of Arabia, and within a hundred years, it reached the farthest 
regions of the earth, both in the East and the West. Both the prophecy and its 
fulfilment are thus two of the most amazing facts of history. 



Chapter 42 

Al-Shura Counsel 

This chapter is known as Counsel, from the command in v. 38 to Muslims to 
decide their affairs by counsel among themselves. Chapters 40 to 46 form one 
group; see the introductory note to chapter 40. The subjects discussed in this 
chapter, in sequence, are that Divine mercy is predominant over all the other 
attributes of God, so that His warning is an act of mercy, Divine judgment 
comes to settle differences, God's dealing with people is always just and no 
nation is destroyed unjustly, so that even the unjust are given respite, and 
finally that the Quran, being a revelation, guides to the right way. 



Section 1 : Divine Mercy in giving Warning 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Beneficent God! 2 Knowing, Hearing, Powerful God! a 
3 Thus does Allah, the Mighty, the Wise, reveal to you, and (He 
revealed) to those before you. 4 To Him belongs whatever is in the 
heavens and whatever is in the earth; and He is the High, the 
Great. 5 The heavens may almost be torn apart above them, while 
the angels celebrate the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness 
for those on earth. Now surely Allah is the Forgiving, the Mer- 
ciful. 

6 And those who take protectors besides Him — Allah watches 



a (2) Verse 1 is the same as 40:1; see the footnote there. Verse 2 consists of 
three letters: 'Ain, standing for 'AlTm or Knowing, Sin for Sami' or Hearing, and 
Qaf for Qadir or Powerful. 

b (5) The significance is that the wickedness of man calls for immediate 
punishment, but the mercy of Allah withholds it. The splitting apart of the heaven 
is elsewhere used to signify Divine displeasure at the Christian doctrine of the 
divinity of Jesus (19:90-91). The Divine displeasure at the wickedness of man is 
very great, but His mercy supercedes all. The angels' prayer for forgiveness for 
man shows that Allah Himself desires to forgive man. People's deeds do not merit 
forgiveness, but forgiveness is the attribute of the Divine Being, and that Divine 
attribute is exercised through the solicitude of the angels.

over them; and you are not in charge of them. 7 And thus have We 
revealed to you an Arabic Quran, that you may warn the mother- 
town and those around it," and give warning of the day of 
Gathering, in which there is no doubt. A group will be in the 
Garden and (another) group in the burning Fire. 8 And if Allah had 
pleased, He would surely have made them a single nation, but He 
admits whom He pleases to His mercy. And the wrongdoers have 
no protector nor helper. 9 Or have they taken protectors besides 
Him? But Allah is the Protector, and He gives life to the dead, and 
He is Powerful over all things. 

Section 2: Judgment is given 

10 And in whatever you differ, its judgment is with Allah. 
That is Allah, my Lord; on Him I rely, and to Him I turn. n The 
Originator of the heavens and the earth, He has made for you pairs 
from among yourselves, and pairs of the cattle, too, multiplying 
you thereby. Nothing is like Him; and He is the Hearing, the 
Seeing. 12 His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth — He 
amplifies provision for whom He pleases, and restricts (it also). 
Surely He is Knower of all things. 

13 He has made plain to you the religion which He enjoined 
upon Noah and which We have revealed to you, and which We 
enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus — to establish religion 
and not to be divided in (regard to) it. e Hard it is for those who set 
up partners (with Allah), what you invite them to. Allah chooses 



a (7) Umm al-Qura or the mother of the towns is Makkah, which is so called 
because it was destined to be the spiritual centre of the whole world; see 6:92. 

b (11) So transcendent is the Divine Being, and so far above all material 
conceptions, that a likeness of Him cannot be conceived, even metaphorically. 
The words translated like Him literally mean like a likeness of Him. He is not only 
above all material limitations, but even above the limitation of metaphor. 

c (13) Even so early did the Quran announce that the religion preached by the 
Prophet was not a new religion, but, so far as its basic principles were concerned, 
it was the same religion as was preached by Noah and Abraham and Moses and 
Jesus. The basic principle of Islam — entire submission to One God only — is, in 
fact, the basic principle of the common religion of humanity.

for Himself whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who 
turn (to Him). 14 And they were not divided until after knowledge 
had come to them, out of envy among themselves. And if a word 
had not gone forth from your Lord for an appointed term, judg- 
ment would surely have been given between them. And those who 
were made to inherit the Book after them are surely in disquieting 
doubt about it." 

15 To this then go on inviting, and be steadfast as you are 
commanded, and do not follow their low desires, and say: I 
believe in what Allah has revealed of the Book, and I am com- 
manded to do justice between you. Allah is our Lord and your 
Lord. For us are our deeds, and for you your deeds. There is no 
contention between us and you. Allah will gather us together, and 
to Him is the eventual coming.' 16 And those who dispute about 
Allah after obedience has been rendered to Him, their plea is null 
with their Lord, and upon them is wrath, and for them is severe 
punishment^ 



a (14) The pronoun them in those who were made to inherit the Book after 
them refers to the prophets. The people who were made to inherit the Book after 
the prophets, rejected the very message with which these prophets came. But they 
are told that their punishment is postponed till an appointed term. Such was the 
Divine law — a word gone forth from your Lord — that the struggle against 
Truth gathers strength at first and seems to have the upper hand for a time, but it 
ultimately comes to naught, thus showing that an unseen hand works in support of 
the Truth. 

b (15) The argument was so simple and sound. The Prophet told the followers 
of earlier revelation that he was a believer in what Allah had revealed of the Book, 
in all revelation that came before him, and the basic principles of his revelation 
were the same as those of the earlier revelation. The whole thing was so clear that 
there could not be any dispute. There is a clear ray of hope in the concluding 
verses — Allah will gather us — that they will ultimately accept the Truth. 
(Editor 's Note: Muslims are here commanded to do justice and follow principles 
instead of prejudices in judging others. It is added that Allah will judge everyone, 
Muslim or otherwise, by their deeds, and not claims and labels.) 

c (16) The reference in those who dispute about Allah after obedience has 
been rendered to Him may be to the followers of earlier revelation, because their 
books required obedience to a Prophet who should appear after them. Or, the 
meaning may be, after people have begun to enter Islam, and Islam has been estab- 
lished in the land despite the severest opposition. 



42 : 17 • ALLAH'S DEALING IS JUST 605 

17 Allah is He Who revealed the Book with truth, and (He 
revealed) the measure;" and what will make &gt;&gt;ou know that perhaps 
the Hour is near. 18 Those who do not believe in it would hasten it 
on, and those who believe are in fear from it, and they know that it 
is the Truth. Now surely those who dispute concerning the Hour 
are far astray. 19 AUah is Benignant to His servants, He gives suste- 
nance to whom He pleases, and He is the Strong, the Mighty. 

Section 3: Allah's Dealing is Just 

20 Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We give him 
increase in his harvest; and whoever desires the harvest of this 
world, We give him of it, and he has no portion in the Hereafter. 
21 0r do they have partners (of Allah) who have prescribed for 
them any religion that Allah does not sanction? And if it were not 
for the word of judgment (of respite), the matter would certainly 
have been decided between them. And surely for the wrongdoers 
is a painful punishment. 22 7ou see the wrongdoers fearing on 
account of what they have earned, and it must befall them. And 
those who believe and do good are in the meadows of the Gardens 
— they have what they please with their Lord. That is the great 
grace. 23 This is what Allah gives the good news of, to His servants 
who believe and do good. Say: I ask of you nothing in return for it 



a (17) For the meaning of mizan ('measure' or 'balance') in the Quran, see 
55:7 footnote. Elsewhere it is said: "Certainly We sent Our messengers with clear 
arguments, and sent down with them the Book and the measure (mizan), that people 
may conduct themselves with equity" (57:25). Thus, the purpose of revealing the 
balance or measure is that people may conduct themselves with equity; in other 
words that they may be able to carry out the ordinances contained in the Book 
justly. This is what the Prophet shows by his example. The ordinances of the 
Book are given in words, and the Prophet translates them into deeds, so that it is 
by following his example that people are led aright. The Prophet' s example is thus 
a balance or measure which is as essential for the right guidance of people as the 
Book. According to some, the mizan here means the Law by which the rights and 
obligations of people are weighed. 

b (21) The word of judgment indicates a judgment already pronounced, that 
a respite will be given to the wrongdoers so that they may have an opportunity to 
reform themselves.

but love for relatives." And whoever earns good, We give him 
more of good in it. Surely Allah is Forgiving, Grateful. 24 0r do 
they say: He has forged a lie against Allah? So, if Allah please, He 
would seal your heart (against them). And Allah blots out the 
falsehood and confirms the Truth with His words. Surely He is 
Knower of what is in the hearts. 

25 And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants 
and pardons evil deeds, and He knows what you do; 26 and He 
answers those who believe and do good deeds, and gives them 
more out of His grace. And for the disbelievers is a severe punish- 
ment. 27 And if Allah were to amplify the provision for His 
servants, they would rebel in the earth; but He sends (it) down by 
measure, as He pleases. Surely He is Aware, Seer of His servants. 
28 And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, 
and He unfolds His mercy. And He is the Friend, the Praised One. 
29 And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and 
all the living beings He has spread forth in both of them. And He 
is All-powerful to gather them together, when He will.

30 And whatever misfortune befalls you, it is on account of

cannot escape in the earth, and besides Allah you have no protec- 
tor nor helper. 32 And of His signs are the ships, like mountains on 



a (23) The statement that the Prophet did not ask for any reward at all is 
made very often in the Quran. The Arabs, closely related as they were to each other, 
were in a state of constant warfare. They are told to give up mutual warfare and to 
love one another. A similar statement is made elsewhere: "I ask of you no reward 
for it except that whoever wishes may take a way to his Lord" (25:57). In both 
cases what the Prophet wanted was not a reward for himself, but it was a good for 
the people themselves, being, in the second case, that they walk in the ways of 
God or lead godly lives and, in the first, that they love one another. 

b (24) The sealing of the Prophet's heart signifies making it secure against 
the abuse of his opponents, who called him an impostor. By blotting out the false- 
hood and confirming the Truth, the abuses would be stopped, and thus his heart 
would be made secure against them. The "words" here imply the prophecies whose 
fulfilment would firmly establish the Truth.

on its back. Surely there are signs in this for every patient, grateful 
one, 34 or He causes them to perish for what they have earned, and 
He pardons much;" 35 and (that) those who dispute about Our 
messages may know. There is no refuge for them. 

36 So whatever you are given is but a provision of this 
world's life, and what Allah has is better and more lasting for 
those who believe and rely on their Lord; 37 and those who shun 
the great sins and indecencies, and whenever they are angry they 
forgive; 38 and those who respond to their Lord and keep up prayer, 
and whose affairs are (decided) by counsel among themselves, and 
who spend (on good works) out of what We have given them; 6 
39 and those who, when great wrong afflicts them, defend them- 
selves. 40 And the recompense of evil is punishment like it; but 
whoever forgives and brings about reform, his reward is with Allah. 
Surely He does not love the wrongdoers/ 41 And whoever defends 



a (34) The ship in these two verses is the ship of the affairs of the disbelie- 
vers, which was ultimately to be wrecked, yet Allah dealt with them mercifully by 
pardoning most of the wicked things they did. The next verse makes the signifi- 
cance clear by drawing attention to the fact that the statement is a warning to 
those who dispute about the messages of Allah, that they will find no refuge when 
their ship is wrecked. 

b (38) Muslims are here enjoined as usual to observe prayer and to spend out 
of what Allah has given them, yet between these two injunctions, which always 
go together in the Quran, is placed a third: whose affairs are decided by counsel 
among themselves. At the early period when this verse was revealed, the Muslims 
had no important matters to decide for which they might have stood in need of 
counsel. The injunction is clearly meant to prepare them for transacting the 
momentous affairs of State and all matters connected with national weal or woe. 
All affairs of the Islamic state must be transacted by counsel. In this Islam has laid 
the basis of Government by parliaments, and the idea found a clear practical 
expression in the early days of the Caliphate, when the Khalifa had to refer every 
important affair to counsel. 

c (40) Punishment must be proportionate to the evil committed, a very just 
and necessary restriction. Forgiveness here is not neglected, nor preached in such 
a manner as to make it impracticable. There is in Islam neither the one extreme of 
an eye for an eye nor the opposite one of turning the other cheek. It teaches the 
golden and beautiful mean that forgiveness may be exercised, if forgiveness will 
mend the matter and do good to the wrongdoer himself. The object to be kept in

himself after his being oppressed, these it is against whom there is 
no way (of blame). 42 The way (of blame) is only against those 
who oppress people and revolt in the earth unjustly. For such there 
is a painful punishment. 43 And whoever is patient and forgives — 
that surely is an affair of great resolution. 

Section 5: Revelation guides Aright 

44 And he whom Allah leaves in error, has no friend after Him. 
And you will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, 
saying: Is there any way of return? 45 And you will see them 
brought before it, humbling themselves because of disgrace, look- 
ing with a faint glance. And those who believe will say: Surely the 
losers are they who lose themselves and their followers on the day 
of Resurrection. Now surely the wrongdoers are in lasting punish- 
ment. 46 And they will have no friends to help them besides Allah. 
And he whom Allah leaves in error cannot find a way. 

47 Respond to your Lord before the day comes from Allah 
which cannot be averted. You will have no refuge on that day, nor 
will it be yours to make a denial. 48 But if they turn away, We have 
not sent you as a watcher over them. Four duty is only to deliver 
the message. And surely when We make man taste mercy from 
Us, he rejoices at it; and if an evil afflicts them on account of what 
their hands have already done, then surely man is ungrateful. 
49 Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates 
what He pleases. He grants females to whom He pleases and 
grants males to whom He pleases, 50 or He grants them both males 
and females, and He makes whom He pleases barren. Surely He is 
Knower, Powerful." 

51 And it is not granted to a mortal that Allah should speak to 



view is to bring about reform, whether it is attained by giving proportionate 
punishment or by exercising forgiveness. 

a (50) The birth of a daughter was looked upon by the Arabs as a calamity 
(see 16:58-59), this being due to the low position which women held in society. 
The wonderful change brought about by Islam in the status of woman is clearly 
foreshadowed in this early revelation, where the daughter has the precedence over 
the son. 



42 : 52 • REVELATION GUIDES ARIGHT 609 

him, except by revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending a 
messenger and revealing by His permission what He pleases. " 
Surely He is High, Wise. 52 And thus did We reveal to you an 
inspired Book by Our command.* Fou did not know what the 
Book was, nor (what) Faith (was), but We made it a light, guiding 
with it whom We please of Our servants. And surely you guide to 
the right path — 53 the path of Allah, to Whom belongs whatsoever 
is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Now surely to 
Allah do all affairs eventually come. 



a (51) According to this verse Allah speaks to a person in three ways: (1) by 
wahy, meaning the inspired word which enters the hearts of the prophets and of 
the righteous. It is in this sense that a revelation is spoken of as being granted to 
the mother of Moses (28:7), and to the disciples of Jesus who were not prophets 
(5:111). (2) "from behind a veil" — a scene is shown as in a vision carrying a 
deeper significance, or words are heard by the person spoken to as from behind a 
veil. (3) The third form of revelation is that in which a messenger — an angel — 
is chosen by the Almighty to deliver His message to the person to whom He 
wishes to speak. This is the highest form of revelation, and such is the revelation 
of the Quran as granted to the Holy Prophet, being recited by the angel Gabriel. 
This revelation is granted only to prophets, while the other two may also be gran- 
ted to the righteous who are not prophets. It should, however, be borne in mind 
that in all these cases the recipient of the revelation is granted certain other senses. 
He sees what others do not see and he hears words which others do not hear. It is, 
therefore, with what may be called the spiritual senses that he hears and sees and 
feels things which others do not hear, see, or feel. 

b (52) The words "and thus" refer to the last mode of granting revelation, 
because the Quran is spoken of as having been brought by the Angel Gabriel 
(2:97) or the Faithful Spirit (26:193). The word translated as "inspired Book" here 
is ruh, usually meaning spirit. Its use as meaning inspiration, and not the soul, is 
conclusive here. The Quran may be called the ruh or the spirit because it gave life 
to a dead world. It is dead again, and again will life be breathed into it by the 
Quran. 



Chapter 43 

Zukhruf Gold 

This chapter is named Gold from its mention in v. 35, where it is stated that it 
is not gold and silver and the like but righteous deeds that are acceptable to 
God. Chapters 40 to 46 form one group; see the introductory note to chapter 
40. The chapter opens by declaring that the revelation of the Quran has come 
as a favour from the Merciful God, despite people's wrongdoing. Then, after 
condemning polytheism, it answers the objection as to why an influential or 
wealthy man was not chosen as God's messenger instead of the Prophet 
Muhammad. It goes on to state that those who deny the revelation will, in the 
end, regret their deeds, and even the powerful Pharaoh was destroyed when 
he refused to listen to Moses. Then the objection of the idolaters is answered 
as to why Muslims accept Jesus when he is also taken as god by his followers. 
Lastly, the chapter contrasts the fate of the believers and the disbelievers. 



Section 1 : Revelation is a Divine Favour 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Beneficent God! 2 By the Book that makes manifest! 3 Surely 
We have made it an Arabic Quran that you may understand. 4 And 
it is in the Original of the Book with Us, fl truly elevated, full of 
wisdom. 5 Shall We then turn away the Reminder from you 
altogether because you are a people committing excesses? 6 And 
how many a prophet did We send among the ancients! 7 And no 



a (4) The term Umm al-Kitab literally signifies mother or original of the Book, 
and the opening chapter of the Quran is also known by this name, because, in its 
essence, it contains the whole of the Quran. But here it signifies the original 
source — the knowledge of God — from which the Quran comes, and the 
meaning is that the Quran cannot be destroyed because it exists in Divine Know- 
ledge. The words, in fact, contain a prophecy, uttered at a time when the Prophet 
was alone and helpless, that the Quran will be exalted in the world, for that is its 
position in Divine Knowledge. The same term Umm al-Kitab in 3:7 and 13:39 
signifies the basis of the book. 

b (5) Allah would not refrain from admonishing a people who commit 
excesses.

prophet came to them but they mocked him. "Then We destroyed 
those stronger than these in prowess, and the example of the 
ancients has gone before. 

9 And if you ask them, Who created the heavens and the earth, 
they would say: The Mighty, the Knowing One, has created them, 
10 Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and made in it ways 
for you that you might go aright. u And Who sends down water 
from the cloud according to a measure, then We raise to life by it 
a dead land; even so will you be brought forth." 12 And Who 
created pairs of all things, and made for you ships and cattle on 
which you ride, 13 that you may sit firmly on their backs, then 
remember the favour of your Lord, when you are firmly seated on 
them, and say: Glory be to Him Who made this subservient to us 
and we were not able to do it, 14 and surely to our Lord we must 
return. 15 And they assign to Him some of His servants (as His 
offspring). Man, to be sure, is clearly ungrateful. 

Section 2: Polytheism condemned 

16 Or has He taken daughters to Himself of what He creates 
and chosen you to have sons? e 17 And when one of them is given 
news (of the birth) of that the like of which he ascribes to the 
Beneficent, his face becomes black and he is full of rage. 18 Is one 
decked with ornaments and unable to make plain speech in disputes 
(a partner with God)? 19 And they consider the angels, who are 



a (11) As rain descending from heaven quickens a dead earth, so Divine 
revelation would regenerate or raise to life people who, sunk in ignorance and 
superstitions, were spiritually, morally, and intellectually a dead people. 

b (15) This refers to the Christian doctrine of assigning a son to God, and in 
the next verse to the idolatrous doctrine of ascribing daughters to God. 

c(16) This subject is also dealt with in 16:57-58 and 37:149-153. In the 
latter place there is clear mention of their calling the angels daughters of God. 
Similar words occur in v. 19. The next verse shows how untrue they were to 
themselves, as they ascribed daughters to God but disliked daughters for them- 
selves. 

d (18) The reference in this verse is to the idols which were bedecked with 
ornaments. The inability of the idols to speak is adduced by Abraham as an

the servants of the Beneficent, to be females. Did they witness 
their creation? Their evidence will be recorded and they will be 
questioned. 

20 And they say: If the Beneficent had pleased, we would not 
have worshipped them. They have no knowledge of this; they only 
lie. 21 Or have We given them a Book before it so that they hold 
fast to it? 22 Rather, they say: We found our fathers on a course, 
and surely we are guided by their footsteps. 23 And thus, We did 
not send before you a warner in a town, but its wealthy ones said: 
Surely we found our fathers following a religion, and we follow 
their footsteps. 24 (The warner) said: And even if I bring to you a 
better guide than that which you found your fathers following? 
They said: We surely disbelieve in what you are sent with. 25 So 
We exacted retribution from them, then see what was the end of 
the rejectors! 

Section 3: Allah's Choice of a Prophet 

26 And when Abraham said to his sire and his people: I am 
clear of what you worship, 27 except Him Who created me, for 
surely He will guide me. 28 And he made it a word to continue in 
his posterity that they might return (to it). a 29 But I let these and 
their fathers enjoy till the Truth came to them and a Messenger 
making manifest. 30 And when the Truth came to them they said: 
This is enchantment, and surely we are disbelievers in it. 

31 And they say: Why was not this Quran revealed to a man 
of importance in the two towns? 32 Do they apportion the mercy 

argument against their divinity (21:63), and the same inability of the idols to 
answer the prayers of their devotees is advanced as an argument against the 
divinity of the golden calf (20:89). It should be borne in mind that the two doc- 
trines, taking the angels as daughters of God and worship of female divinities, 
were connected with each other in the Arab mind. 

a (28) This shows that the Arabs possessed enduring traditions that their 
great ancestor Abraham was a preacher of Unity. 

b (31) The two towns referred to are Makkah and Ta'if. They would not 
follow any but an important man of the world, a man possessing much wealth or 
high rank. Moral greatness possessed no value in their eyes. 



43 : 33 • OPPOSITION TO TRUTH IS PUNISHED 613 

of jour Lord? We portion out among them their livelihood in the 
life of this world, and We exalt some of them above others in 
rank, that some of them may take others in service. And the mercy 
of your Lord is better than what they amass. a 33 And if it were not 
that all people would become one (disbelieving) community, We 
would provide for those who disbelieve in the Beneficent, roofs of 
silver for their houses and stairs (of silver) by which they ascend, 
34 and (of silver) the doors of their houses and the couches on 
which they recline, 35 and of gold. And all this is only a provision 
of this world's life; and the Hereafter is, with your Lord, only for 
the dutiful. 

Section 4: Opposition to Truth is punished 

36 And whoever turns himself away from the remembrance of 
the Beneficent, We appoint for him a devil, so he is his associated 
37 And surely they hinder them from the (right) path, and they 
think that they are guided aright. 38 Until when he comes to Us, he 
says: If only between me and you there were the distance of the 
East and the West! And evil is the associate! 39 And as you did 
wrong, it will not benefit you at all this day that you are sharers in 
the punishment. 

40 Can you then make the deaf to hear or guide the blind and 



a (32) Human society is based on differences in rank. It is only through this 
difference that society can be organized and developed into a State, whether it be 
under modern socialism or capitalism. From these differences in the external 
conditions of people, the conclusion is drawn that differences must exist in the 
spiritual sphere too, and some people are chosen to guide others. Allah's choice 
for prophethood does not, however, depend on wealth, but on internal worth. 

b (35) Gold and silver have no value in the sight of Allah, and He would 
grant these things to disbelievers to any extent they desire, if it were not that most 
people would be misled by these worldly temptations. The verse undoubtedly 
draws a picture of the modern condition of the world, where man's whole energy 
is devoted to the acquisition of material gains and more material gains, and people 
are shutting their eyes altogether to the moral values of life, with the result that 
the world today stands on the brink of an abyss of utter destruction. 

c (36) As v. 37 shows, the devil here is the evil companion who leads man to 
evil.

him who is in clear error? 41 So if We takejou away, still We shall 
exact retribution from them, 42 or We shall show you what We 
promise them — surely We are Powerful over them." 43 So hold 
fast to what has been revealed to you; surely you are on the right 
path. 44 And surely it is a reminder for you and jour people, and 
you will be questioned. 45 And ask those of Our messengers whom 
We sent before you: Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped 
besides the Beneficent? 

Section 5: Pharaoh's Opposition to Moses 

46 And truly We sent Moses with Our messages to Pharaoh 
and his chiefs, so he said: I am the messenger of the Lord of the 
worlds. 47 But when he brought them Our signs, lo! they laughed at 
them. 48 And We did not show them a sign but it was greater than 
its fellow, and We seized them with punishment that they might 
turn. 49 And they said: O enchanter, call on jour Lord for us, as He 
has made the covenant with you; we shall surely follow guidance/ 
50 But when We removed from them the punishment, lo! they 
broke the pledge. 

51 And Pharaoh proclaimed amongst his people, saying: My 
people, is not the kingdom of Egypt mine and these rivers flowing 
beneath me? Do you not see? 52 Rather I am better than this 
(fellow) who is contemptible, and can hardly express himself 
clearly. 53 Why, then, have bracelets of gold not been bestowed on 
him, or angels come along with him in procession? 54 So he 
incited his people to levity and they obeyed him. Surely they were 



a (42) V. 41 describes the general law of the punishment of the wicked; even 
if the Prophet dies, the wicked will meet their doom. But the general statement 
should not give rise to any misconception, so we are immediately told that the 
Prophet would see the discomfiture of his enemies with his own eyes. 

b (48) Each sign was greater than the one which preceded it. 

c (49) Every time a sign was shown, Pharaoh entreated Moses to pray for the 
removal of the punishment, promising that he would not in that case oppose him. 

d (53) Pharaoh's suggestion is that if Moses were true he should have 
possessed much wealth like a king or he should have come with angels, as a king 
comes with his armies. 



43 : 55 • JESUS AS PROPHET 615 

a transgressing people. 55 Then when they displeased Us, We 
exacted retribution from them, so We drowned them all together. 
56 And We made them a thing past and an example for later 
generations. 

Section 6: Jesus as Prophet 

57 And when the son of Mary is mentioned as an example, lo! 
your people raise a clamour at it. 58 And they say: Are our gods 
better, or is he? They set it forth to you only by way of disputa- 
tion. Indeed, they are a contentious people." 59 He was only a 
servant on whom We bestowed favour and We made him an 
example for the Children of Israel; 60 and if We pleased, We 
could appoint among you angels to be (Our) representatives in the 
land. 61 And this (revelation) is surely knowledge of the Hour, e so 
have no doubt about it and follow me. This is the right path. 62 And 
do not let the devil hinder you; surely he is your open enemy. 



a (58) The Quran in many places condemns the doctrine of attributing children 
to the Almighty. But when the case of Jesus was cited, the disbelievers objected to 
the respect shown to him, while their own idols were condemned: "Are our gods 
better, or is he?" Why should not the same honour be shown to their national gods 
as was shown to the god of another nation? 

b (59) This verse contains the answer to the above objection. Jesus was not 
honoured because the Christians took him for God or Son of God, which was in 
fact their own error, but because he was a righteous servant of Allah on whom He 
had bestowed favours. He was also an example of virtue for the Israelites to 
whom he was sent as a prophet. On the other hand, the idols whom the Arabs took 
for gods were mere stones and could do no good to their worshippers. Moreover, 
the idol-worshippers represented even their great men as sunk in immorality. 

c (61) The Hour signifies here the departure of prophethood from the house 
of Israel. Such is the clear significance of the parable of the vineyard in Matthew 
21:33, Mark 12:1, and Luke 20:9, which ends thus: "Therefore I say to you, The 
kingdom of God will be taken from you, and given to a nation bearing the fruits 
of it" (Matthew 21:43). Prophethood had long remained in the house of Israel, 
and, as history shows, Jesus was the last prophet of the Mosaic dispensation. The 
Quran is here called the knowledge of the Hour in the sense that its revelation was 
a clear indication that prophethood was now being taken away from the house of 
Israel and given to another people, as Jesus himself had said. Some take the pro- 
noun hu as referring to Jesus and translate these words as "he is the knowledge of 
the Hour", but even then the meaning would be that Jesus was sent to give people 
the knowledge that he was the last prophet of the Israelite dispensation. 



616 43. GOLD -43:63 

63 And when Jesus came with clear arguments, he said: I have 
come to you indeed with wisdom, and to make clear to you some 
of what you differ about. So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 
64 Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so serve Him. This is 
the right path. 65 But factions among them differed, so woe to those 
who did wrong for the punishment of a painful day! 66 Do they 
wait only for the Hour," that it should come on them all of a 
sudden, while they do not perceive? 67 Friends on that day will be 
foes to one another, except those who keep their duty. 

Section 7: The Two Parties 

68 O My servants, there is no fear for you this day, nor will 
you grieve — 69 those who believed in Our messages and sub- 
mitted (to Us). 70 Enter the Garden, you and your wives, ' being 
made happy. 71 Round about them are made to go golden bowls 
and drinking-cups, and therein is what (their) souls yearn for and 
the eyes delight in, and in it you will abide. 72 And this is the 
Garden which you are made to inherit on account of what you did. 
73 You shall have in it abundant fruit, of which to eat. 

74 Surely the guilty will abide in the punishment of hell. 75 It 
is not abated for them and in it they will despair. 76 And We did 
not wrong them but they were themselves the wrongdoers. 77 And 
they cry: O Malik, e let jour Lord make an end of us. He will say: 
You shall stay (here). 78 Certainly We bring the Truth to you, but 
most of you dislike the Truth. 79 0r have they settled a matter? But 
it is We Who settle (matters). 80 Or do they think that We do not 
hear their secrets and their private counsels? Yes indeed, and Our 
messengers with them write down. 



a (66) The Hour here signifies the doom of the Quraish. 

b (70) It is with their wives that the faithful are told to enter paradise. 

c (77) Malik means literally master. Here it signifies the angel appointed 
over those in hell. 

d (79) The disbelievers are told that they should not think that they have 
settled the matter of the Holy Prophet by their plans to kill him, for it is Allah Who 
really settles all matters. 



43 : 81 • THE TWO PARTIES 617 

81 Say: The Beneficent has no son; so I am the foremost of 
those who serve (God).° 82 Glory be to the Lord of the heavens 
and the earth, the Lord of the Throne of Power, from what they 
describe! 83 So let them talk and sport until they meet their day 
which they are promised. 84 And He it is Who is God in the 
heavens and God in the earth. And He is the Wise, the Knowing. 
85 And blessed is He Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the 
earth and all that is between them; and with Him is the knowledge 
of the Hour, and to Him you will be returned. 

86 And those whom they call upon besides Him do not control 
intercession, but he who bears witness to the Truth and they know 
(him). 87 And if you were to ask them who created them, they 
would say: Allah. How are they then turned away (from truth)! 
88 And his cry — O my Lord, these are a people who do not 
believe ! c 89 So turn away from them and say, Peace! They will 
soon come to know. 



a (81) This verse is commonly translated as meaning that ;/'God had a son, 
the Prophet would be the foremost of those who serve that son. While the Arabic 
word in (occurring after "say") means if it is also used to indicate negation. See, 
for instance, 10:68. The word "Beneficent" (Rahman) itself negatives the very 
idea on which the doctrine of sonship is based; see 19:88-93. Even if in is taken 
as meaning if, the verse would mean that when a man serves God he may meta- 
phorically be called a son of God, and therefore the Holy Prophet, being the fore- 
most of those who serve, would be a son in that sense, but he refused to be called 
son of God because such metaphorical words had given rise to grievous errors. 

b (86) The bearer of witness to the Truth is no other than the Holy Prophet, 
and they knew well that he was the most truthful of people. 

c (88) After years of hard work among them and after being subjected to 
every kind of persecution, the Holy Prophet still prays to Allah not to inflict 
punishment upon his opponents. He, however, unburdens his mind in the cry: 
"O my Lord, these are a people who do not believe". An unparalleled example of 
heroic fortitude under trials and loving sympathy for fellow-men! 

d (89) Turning away from them and saying "Peace!" are clear prophecies of 
the emigration. The early Makkan revelation contains undeniable prophecies of all 
the important later events in the life of the Holy Prophet. 



Chapter 44 
Ai-Dukhan The Drought 

The title of this chapter is The Drought from the prophecy of the drought in 
v. 10. Chapters 40 to 46 form one group; see the introductory note to chapter 
40. It predicts lighter punishment followed by severer if the opponents of 
truth did not repent, and cites the case of Pharaoh. Then it contrasts the final 
conditions of the righteous and the wicked. 



Section 1 : Lighter Punishment followed by Severer 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.

them, if you would be sure. "There is no God but He; He gives life 
and causes death — your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers. 

9 But, in doubt, they sport. 10 So wait for the day when the 
heaven brings a clear drought/ "enveloping people. This is a 



a (3) The revelation of the Quran on a blessed night has a deeper meaning 
beneath it than the mere fact that the revelation began on the blessed night which 
is elsewhere called Lailat al-Qadr (97:1), one of the last ten nights in the month 
of Ramadan. The night stands for a time of darkness and ignorance, when true 
knowledge had disappeared from the world. A prophet's advent is always pre- 
ceded by such darkness, and when the Holy Prophet made his appearance, such 
darkness prevailed in all countries of the world. This night is called a blessed 
night because in it the world received the greatest manifestation of Divine light. 

b (4) Divine revelation distinguishes truth from falsehood and reveals the 
treasures of wisdom to people.

painful punishment. 12 Our Lord, remove from us the punishment 
— surely we are believers. 13 When will they be reminded? And a 
Messenger has indeed come, making clear; i 4 yet they turned away 
from him and said: One taught (by others), a madman! 15 We shall 
remove the punishment a little, (but) you will surely return (to 
evil). 16 On the day when We seize (them) with the most violent 
seizing; surely We shall exact retribution." 

17 And certainly We tried before them Pharaoh's people and 
a noble messenger came to them, 18 saying: Deliver to me the ser- 
vants of Allah.* Surely I am a faithful messenger to you. 19 And do 
not exalt yourselves against Allah. Surely I bring to you a clear 
authority. 20 And I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord, that 
you may not stone me to death. 21 And if you do not believe in me, 
leave me alone. 22 Then he called upon his Lord: These are a guilty 
people. 23 So go forth with My servants by night; surely you will 
be pursued, 24 and leave the sea behind calm. c Surely they are an 
army to be drowned. 25 How many of the gardens and springs they 
left behind! 26 And cornfields and noble places! 27 And goodly 
things in which they rejoiced! 28 Thus (it was). And We made other 
people inherit them. 29 So the heaven and the earth did not weep 
for them, nor were they given respite/ 

here is drought. The statements made in these verses are all prophetical. Drought 
struck Makkah after the Quraish had rejected, opposed and persecuted the Holy 
Prophet Muhammad. Also prophetical is the statement of v. 15, We shall remove 
the punishment a little, because the removal of the drought was followed by the 
"violent seizing" (v. 16), which brought on the conquest of Makkah. 

a (16) The prophecy here seems to refer to the constant defeats in battle that 
were to be suffered by the Quraish, beginning with the battle of Badr, and result- 
ing in the final overthrow of their power by the conquest of Makkah. 

b (18) Moses wanted the Israelites to be allowed to leave Egypt. 

c (24) There was no storm in the sea when it was left by the Israelites, so that 
the Egyptians, finding it calm and motionless, followed the Israelites. 

d (29) The weeping for a dead man signifies the remembering of his good 
qualities or actions, which often brings tears to the eyes. The heaven and the earth 
did not weep for them because they had neither the love of God in their hearts, 
nor had they done anything for the good of people, so that their good qualities 
should have been remembered either in heaven or on earth. 



620 44. THE DROUGHT • 44 : 30 

Section 2: Good and Evil rewarded 

30 And We indeed delivered the Children of Israel from the 
humiliating punishment, 31 from Pharaoh. Surely he was high- 
handed, committing excesses. 32 And certainly We chose them 
above the nations, in having knowledge. 33 And We gave them 
signs in which was clear blessing. 

34 These do indeed say: 35 There is only our first death and we 
shall not be raised again. 36 So bring our fathers (back), if you are 
truthful. 37 Are they better or the people of Tubba," and those 
before them? We destroyed them, for surely they were guilty. 
38 And We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is 
between them in sport. 39 We did not create them but with truth, 
but most of them do not know. 40 Surely the day of Decision is the 
term for them all, 41 the day when friend will not avail friend in the 
least, nor will they be helped — 42 except those on whom Allah 
has mercy. Surely He is the Mighty, the Merciful. 

Section 3: Good and Evil rewarded 

43 Surely the tree of Zaqqum* 44 is the food of the sinful, 
45 like molten brass; it seethes in (their) bellies 46 like boiling water. 
47 Seize him, then drag him into the midst of hell; 48 then pour on 
his head torment of boiling water — 49 Taste — you are the (so- 
called) mighty, the honourable ! c 50 Surely this is what you doubted. 

51 Those who keep their duty are indeed in a secure place — 
52 in gardens and springs, 53 wearing fine silk and thick brocade, 
facing one another — 54 thus (shall it be). And We shall join them 
to pure, beautiful ones. 55 They call therein for every fruit in

Yaman. The particular Tubba spoken of here is said to have been a prophet. 

b (43) See 37:62 footnote. 

c (49) Those who considered themselves mighty and honourable in the land 
and tried their utmost to exterminate the Truth were ultimately brought low in the 
land in this very life and thus tasted the consequences of their arrogance.

death; and He will save them from the punishment of hell — 57 a 
grace from your Lord. This is the mighty achievement. 58 So We 
have made it easy in jour tongue that they may be mindful. 59 Wait 
then; surely they (too) are waiting. 



Chapter 45 
Ai-jathiyah The Kneeling 

The title of this chapter is taken from v. 28, which speaks of every nation 
ultimately kneeling before God. Chapters 40 to 46 form one group; see the 
introductory note to chapter 40. The first half of this chapter relates that there 
are many signs of the truth of revelation but it is still denied by the disbelie- 
vers. The second half tells us that while the coming of the judgment is denied 
by those whose hearts are hardened, they shall have to face their doom. 



Section 1 : Denial of Revelation 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Beneficent God! 2 The revelation of the Book is from Allah, 
the Mighty, the Wise. 3 Surely in the heavens and the earth are 
signs for believers. 4 And in your creation, and in the animals He 
spreads all over, are signs for a people who are sure; 5 and (in) the 
alternation of the night and the day and (in) the sustenance which 
Allah sends down from the heaven, then gives life with it to the 
earth after its death, and (in) the changing of the winds, are signs 
for a people who understand. 6 These are the messages of Allah, 
which We recite to you with truth. In what announcement will 
they then believe after Allah and His signs?" 

7 Woe to every sinful liar! 8 who hears the messages of Allah 
recited to him then persists in arrogance, as though he had not 
heard them. So announce to him a painful punishment. 'And when 
he comes to know of any of Our messages, he takes them for a 
jest. For such is a humiliating punishment. 10 In front of them is 
hell, and what they have earned will not avail them in the least, 
nor those whom they take for protectors besides Allah, and for 
them is a grievous punishment. "This is guidance; and those who 



a (6) After Allah and His signs, i.e., after the word of Allah and His signs 
have come to them. 



622 



45 : 12 • TRUTH OF THE REVELATION 623 

disbelieve in the messages of their Lord, for them is a painful 
punishment of an evil (kind). 

Section 2: Truth of the Revelation 

12 Allah is He Who made subservient to you the sea that the 
ships may glide in it by His command, and that you may seek of 
His grace, and that you may give thanks. 13 And He has made sub- 
servient to you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in 
the earth, all, from Himself. Surely there are signs in this for a 
people who reflect. 

14 Tell those who believe to forgive those who do not fear the 
days of Allah that He may reward a people for what they earn." 
15 Whoever does good, it is for the good of his own soul, and who- 
ever does evil, it is to its detriment; then to your Lord you will be 
brought back. 

16 And certainly We gave the Children of Israel the Book and 
judgment and prophethood and provided them with good things, 
and made them excel the nations. 17 And We gave them clear argu- 
ments in the Affair. So they did not differ until after knowledge 
had come to them, out of envy among themselves. Surely j^our 
Lord will judge between them on the day of Resurrection in that in 
which they differed. 18 Then We made you follow a course in the 
Affair, so follow it, and do not follow the low desires of those 
who do not know. 19 Surely they cannot avail you in the least against 
Allah. And surely the wrongdoers are friends of each other, and 
Allah is the Friend of the dutiful. 

20 These are clear proofs for mankind, and a guidance and a 
mercy for a people who are sure. 21 Or do those who commit evil 



a (14) By the days of Allah are meant the favours which are bestowed on the 
righteous; see 14:5. These words make it clear that there is an assurance given to 
the faithful in the two previous verses that they will be triumphant in this world, 
and rule the land as well as the sea. 

b (17) The Affair or Amr here signifies the prophethood of Muhammad, 
regarding which the Israelites were given the clearest prophecies. In the next 
verse the Holy Prophet is plainly addressed as having been given this Affair. 



624 45. THE KNEELING • 45 : 22 

deeds think that We shall make them as those who believe and do 
good — their life and their death being equal? Evil is what they 
judge f 

Section 3: Denial of Judgment 

22 And Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth, 
and that every soul may be rewarded for what it has earned, and 
they will not be wronged. 23 Have you seen him who takes his 
desire for his god, and Allah leaves him in error knowingly, and 
seals his hearing and his heart and puts a covering on his sight? 
Who can then guide him after Allah? Will you not be mindful? 
24 And they say: There is nothing but our life of the world; we die 
and we live and nothing destroys us but time, and they have no 
knowledge of that; they only conjecture. 25 And when Our clear 
messages are recited to them, their only argument is that they say: 
Bring (back) our fathers, if you are truthful. 26 Say: Allah gives 
you life, then makes you die, then will He gather you to the day of 
Resurrection, of which there is no doubt, but most people do not 
know. 

Section 4: The Doom 

27 And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. 
And on the day when the Hour comes to pass, on that day will the 
followers of falsehood perish. 28 And you will see every nation 
kneeling down. Every nation will be called to its record. c This day 



a (21) The meaning may be that the wicked are not like the righteous, either 
in life or in death; or, that the wicked will not find themselves in death in a state 
of ease resembling what they enjoy in this life. Or, the doing of good is here 
called life, and the doing of evil death, because good deeds give life to man and 
evil deeds cause his spiritual death. 

b (23) The word knowingly implies that Allah knows the heart and mental 
attitude of the people of low desires, and the consequence of their evil deeds is 
that they remain in error. 

c (28) That every nation shall have a book or a record of its deeds shows that 
nations are also judged according to their deeds. But nations are judged in this 
life, therefore the day on which every nation is called to its record is the day of 



45 : 29 • THE DOOM 625 

you are recompensed for what you did. 29 This is Our record that 
speaks against you with truth. Surely We wrote what you did. 

30 Then as to those who believed and did good, their Lord 
will admit them to His mercy. That is the manifest achievement. 
31 And as to those who disbelieved — were not My messages 
recited to you? But you were proud and you were a guilty people. 
32 And when it was said, Surely the promise of Allah is true and 
the Hour — there is no doubt about it, you said: We do not know 
what the Hour is. We think (it) only a conjecture and we are not at 
all sure. 33 And the evil of what they did will become plain to 
them, and that at which they mocked will beset them. 34 And it will 
be said: This day We forsake you as you neglected the meeting of 
this day of yours, and your abode is the Fire, and you have no 
helpers. 35 That is because you made the messages of Allah a jest 
and the life of this world deceived you. So on that day they shall 
not be taken out of it, nor shall they be granted goodwill. 

36 So praise be to Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord 
of the earth, the Lord of the worlds! 37 And to Him belongs great- 
ness in the heavens and the earth; and He is the Mighty, the Wise. 



its doom. The words — you will see every nation kneeling down — hint at a great 
spiritual awakening being brought about in the world. 



Chapter 46 
Ai-Ahqaf The Sandhills 

The title of this chapter is taken from the tracts of sand mentioned in v. 21 
which contributed to the destruction of the tribe of Ad. Chapters 40 to 46 form 
one group; see the introductory note to chapter 40. This chapter deals first 
with the truth of revelation and the witness of truth. Then, referring to the fate 
of Ad, it contains a warning for those who reject the truth. 



K&gt; 



Section 1 : Truth of Revelation 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 



1 Beneficent God! 2 The revelation of the Book is from Allah, 
the Mighty, the Wise. 3 We did not create the heavens and the earth 
Sv and all that is between them but with truth and for an appointed 
term." And those who disbelieve turn away from the warning they 
are given. 4 Say: Have you considered what you invoke besides 
Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth, or have they 
a share in the heavens? Bring me a Book before this or any relics 
of knowledge, if you are truthful. 5 And who is in greater error than 
he who invokes besides Allah such (gods) as do not answer him 
till the day of Resurrection, and they are heedless of their call? 
6 And when mankind is gathered together, they will be their enemies, 
and will deny their worshipping (them). 

7 And when Our clear messages are recited to them, those who 
disbelieve say of the Truth when it comes to them: This is clear 
enchantment. 8 Or they say: He has forged it. Say: If I have forged 
it, you control nothing for me from Allah.* He knows best what 
you utter concerning it. He is enough as a witness between me 



a (3) The Universe had a beginning and it will also have an end. 

b (8-1) From Allah here means from the punishment of Allah. If the Quran 
was a lie which the Prophet had forged, none could avert the punishment which 
must come upon a forger. 



626 



46 : 9 • WITNESS OF TRUTH 627 

and you. And He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. 9 Say: I am not 
the first of the messengers,* and I do not know what will be done 
with me or with you. I follow only what is revealed to me, and I 
am but a plain warner. c 10 Say: Have you considered if it is from 
Allah, and you disbelieve in it, and a witness from among the 
Children of Israel has borne witness of one like him/ so he 
believed, while you are big with pride? Surely Allah does not 
guide the wrongdoing people. 

Section 2: Witness of Truth 

11 And those who disbelieve say of those who believe: If it 
had been a good, they would not have attained it before us. And as 
they are not guided by it, they say: It is an old lie. 12 And before it 
was the Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy. And this is a Book 
verifying (it) in the Arabic language/ that it may warn those who 
do wrong, and as good news for the doers of good. "Surely those 
who say, Our Lord is Allah, then continue on the right way, on 



a (8-2) Whenever the punishment of the opponents is alluded to, as in the 
statement He is enough as a witness between me and you, the Divine attribute of 
mercy and forgiveness is also mentioned to indicate that mercy always predomi- 
nates in the Divine nature. 

b (9-1) Prophets had appeared before the Holy Prophet Muhammad in every 
country and nation throughout the whole world, and God's sending messengers 
for the reformation of people was the universal experience of humanity. 

c (9-2) The Prophet is made to deny any detailed knowledge as to the ulti- 
mate end of one or the other party, but the warning is reaffirmed in the concluding 
words to show that evildoers must suffer the consequences of their deeds. 

d (10) The witness from among the Children of Israel, who bore witness of 
one like him, is Moses: "I will raise up for them a Prophet like you from among 
their brethren, . . . And it shall be that whoever will not hear My words, which He 
speaks in My name, I will require it of him" (Deut. 18:18-19). It is to the conclu- 
ding statement in the above quotation that attention is called in the words, Have 
you considered if it is from Allah, and you disbelieve in it. 

e (12) The words refer to the subject-matter of v. 10, which speaks of 
Moses' prophecy. The Quran is here declared as fulfilling that prophecy, and the 
reference to its being in the Arabic language signifies the coming of the Prophet 
from among the Ishmaelites, who spoke that language, and who were the brethren 
of the Israelites, this fact being clearly mentioned in the prophecy of Deut. 18:18.

them is no fear, nor shall they grieve. 14 These are the owners of 
the Garden, abiding in it — a reward for what they did. 

15 And We have enjoined on man the doing of good to his 
parents. His mother bears him with trouble and she gives birth to 
him in pain. And the bearing of him and the weaning of him is 
thirty months. Till, when he attains his maturity and reaches forty 
years," he says: My Lord, grant me that I may give thanks for 
Your favour, which You have bestowed on me and on my parents, 
and that I may do good which pleases You; and be good to me in 
respect of my offspring. Truly I turn to You, and truly I am among 
those who submit. 16 These are they from whom We accept the 
best of what they do and overlook their evil deeds — among the 
owners of the Garden. A promise of truth, which they were 
promised. 

17 And he who says to his parents: Enough of you! Do you 
threaten me that I shall be brought forth, when generations have 
passed away before me? And they both call for Allah's aid: Woe 
to you! Believe; surely the promise of Allah is true. But he says: 
This is nothing but stories of the ancients. 18 These are they against 
whom the word proves true, among nations of jinn and people that 
have passed away before them. Surely they are losers. 

19 And for all are degrees according to what they do, and that 
He may pay them for their deeds and they will not be wronged. 
20 And on the day when those who disbelieve are brought before 
the Fire: You did away with your good things in your life of the 
world and you enjoyed them; so this day you are rewarded with 
the punishment of humiliation because you were unjustly proud in 
the land and because you transgressed. 



a (15) It would appear from this that the spiritual maturity of man usually 
takes place at the age of forty. Evidence of this is also found in the fact that the 
Holy Prophet Muhammad received the Divine message for the regeneration of 
mankind at the age of forty. 



46:21' THE FATE OF AD 629 

Section 3: The Fate of Ad 

21 And mention the brother of Ad; when he warned his people 
in the sandy plains a — and warners indeed came before him and 
after him — saying: Serve none but Allah. Surely I fear for you 
the punishment of a grievous day. 22 They said: Have you come to 
us to turn us away from our gods? Then bring us that (punish- 
ment) with which you threaten us, if you are truthful. 23 He said: 
The knowledge is only with Allah, and I deliver to you that with 
which I am sent, but I see you are an ignorant people. 

24 So when they saw it — a cloud advancing towards their 
valleys, they said: This is a cloud bringing us rain. No, it is what 
you sought to hasten, a wind in which is painful punishment, 
25 destroying everything by the command of its Lord. So at dawn 
nothing could be seen except their dwellings. Thus do We reward 
the guilty people. 26 And certainly We had given them power in 
matters in which We have not empowered you, and We had given 
them ears and eyes and hearts, but neither their ears, nor their 
eyes, nor their hearts availed them in the least, since they denied 
the messages of Allah, and what they mocked at beset them. 

Section 4: A Warning 

27 And certainly We destroyed the towns round about you, 
and We repeat the messages that they may turn (to the guidance). 
28 Then why did those whom they took for gods besides Allah to 
draw (them) near (to Him) not help them? No, they failed them. 
And this was their lie and what they forged. 

29 And when We turned towards you a group of the jinn, who 
listened to the Quran; so when they were in its presence, they said: 
Be silent. Then when it was finished, they turned back to their 



a (21) The brother of a people signifies their prophet, Hud being the prophet 
sent to Ad. The "sandy plains" where these people lived (cd-ahqaf) are located in 
the region of Hadramaut in Arabia. 

b (27) The cities of Ad, Thamud and Sheba lay on the borders of Arabia; 
thus the people living in the metropolis are told how those living around them 
were destroyed previously, and they should take a lesson from their fate. 



630 46. THE SANDHILLS • 46 : 30 

people warning (them)." 30 They said: Our people, we have heard 
a Book revealed after Moses, verifying what is (already) before it, 
guiding to the truth and to a right path. 31 Our people, accept the 
Inviter to Allah and believe in Him. He will forgive you some of 
your sins and protect you from a painful punishment. 32 And who- 
ever does not accept the Inviter to Allah, he cannot escape in the 
earth, nor has he protectors besides Him. These are in clear error. 

33 Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and 
the earth and was not tired by their creation, is Able to give life to 
the dead? Indeed, He is surely Powerful over all things. 34 And on 
the day when those who disbelieve are brought before the Fire: Is 
it not true? They will say: Indeed, by our Lord! He will say: Then 
taste the punishment, because you disbelieved. 35 So have patience 
(O Prophet), as men of resolution, the messengers, had patience, 
and do not seek to hasten on for them (their doom). On the day 
when they see what they are promised, (it will be) as if they had 
remained only an hour of the day. (Your duty is) to deliver. Shall 
then any be destroyed except the transgressing people? 



a (29) The jinn spoken of here seem to be the leaders of certain Jewish 
tribes, because they are spoken of in the next verse as believers in Moses. In fact, 
they are of the same class as those mentioned in 72:1. 



Chapter 47 
Muhammad 

This chapter is entitled Muhammad from the mention of the Holy Prophet's 
name in v. 2, foretelling that the condition of those who believe in him will 
be improved. The first half of the chapter says that those who prevent people 
from accepting the truth will be defeated in war and Makkah will be subjuga- 
ted by the Muslims. The second half refers to the weak-hearted among the 
Muslims and how a separation will be brought about between them and the 
truly faithful. This chapter was revealed at Madinah in 1 A.H. when war with 
the Quraish had not yet begun. 



Section 1 : Opponents will perish in War 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Those who disbelieve and turn (people) from Allah's way, 
He will destroy their works." 2 And those who believe and do 
good, and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad — and 
it is the Truth from their Lord — He will remove their evil from 
them and improve their condition. 3 That is because those who 
disbelieve follow falsehood, and those who believe follow the 
Truth from their Lord. Thus does Allah set forth their descriptions 
for people. 

4 So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, strike the 
necks; then, when you have overcome them, make (them) prisoners, 
and afterwards (set them free) as a favour or for ransom till the 



a (1) This chapter was revealed at a time when the enemies of Islam were at 
the height of their power, and had apparently uprooted Islam from Makkah, and 
were preparing to give it a death-blow at Madinah. 

b (2) This is another prophecy, a counterpart of the one in v. 1 . The Muslims, 
whose condition, it is announced here, will be bettered, were in a most helpless 
condition at the time. The majority of them had just fled from their homes, almost 
penniless, to save their lives and to settle down at Madinah where, however, they 
were not left alone, the enemy being determined to crush them by force.

war lay down its burdens." That (shall be so). And if Allah please, 
He would certainly exact retribution from them, but that He may 
try some of you by means of others.' And those who are killed in 
the way of Allah, He will never allow their deeds to perish. 
5 He will guide them and improve their condition. 6 And make them 
enter the Garden, which He has made known to them. 6 

7 O you who believe, if you help Allah, He will help you and 
make firm your feet. 8 And those who disbelieve, for them is des- 
truction, and He will destroy their works. 9 That is because they 
hate what Allah reveals, so He has made their deeds fruitless. 
10 Have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the end of 
those before them? Allah destroyed them. And for the disbelievers 
is (a fate) similar to it. n That is because Allah is the Patron of 
those who believe, and because the disbelievers have no patron. 

Section 2: Oppressors shall be brought Low 

12 Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good 
enter Gardens in which rivers flow. And those who disbelieve 
enjoy themselves and eat as cattle eat, and the Fire is their abode. 
13 And how many a town (there were), more powerful than your 
town which has driven you out — We destroyed them, so there 



a (4-1) This passage mentions the only case in which prisoners of war can be 
taken, and thus condemns the practice of slavery, according to which people could 
be seized anywhere and sold into slavery. Here we are told that prisoners of war 
can only be taken after meeting an enemy in regular battle, and even in that case 
they must be set free, either as a favour or after taking ransom. It was the former 
alternative that the Holy Prophet adopted in most cases. Only in the case of the 
seventy prisoners taken at Badr is there mention of redemption having been taken, 
but this was when Islam was very weak. See also 8:67 footnote. 

b (4-2) The meaning is that, if Allah had pleased, He could have punished 
the enemies of Islam otherwise than by war, but as He means to punish them by 
the hands of the Muslims, therefore battles must be fought. 

c (6) The Garden of the next life is made known to the righteous in this life 
by making them taste of the spiritual blessings of good deeds in this very life. 
That a paradise is granted to the righteous in this very life is mentioned frequently 
in the Quran. However, triumph over those who would annihilate Truth is also 
spoken of as a garden in this life.

was no helper for them." 14 Is then he who has a clear argument 
from his Lord like him to whom his evil conduct is made to seem 
good; and they follow their low desires. 

15 A parable of the Garden which the dutiful are promised: In 
it are rivers of water not altering for the worse, and rivers of milk 
whose taste does not change, and rivers of wine delicious to the 
drinkers, and rivers of honey clarified; and they shall have in it 
all fruits and protection from their Lord. (Are these) like those who 
abide in the Fire and who are made to drink boiling water, so it 
tears their bowels apart? 

16 And some of them seek to listen to you, till, when they go 
forth from you, they say to those who have been given knowledge: 
What was it that he said just now? These are they whose hearts 
Allah has sealed and they follow their low desires. 17 And those 
who follow guidance, He increases them in guidance and grants 
them their observance of duty. 

18 Do they wait only for the Hour, that it should come upon 
them suddenly? Now tokens of it have already come. e But how, 
when it comes upon them, will their reminder benefit them? 19 So 
know that there is no god but Allah and ask protection for your sin 



a (13) The opponents of Islam in Makkah were not destroyed when their 
final overthrow came, nor did the Holy Prophet punish them for their crimes against 
the Muslims. They were dealt with very mercifully — so mercifully that history 
does not present another instance of such merciful treatment of a conquered 
nation of oppressors. By their destruction was thus meant the overthrow of their 
power. 

b (15) The description given does not mention the actual blessings of para- 
dise, for they are blessings "which no eye has seen, nor has any ear heard, nor has 
it entered into the heart of man to conceive them" (Bukhari, 59:8). The blessings 
mentioned here are plainly called a parable, an example which shows what they 
are like. 

c (18) By the Hour is to be understood the hour of their doom, the overthrow 
of their power, which is clearly spoken of in the previous verses. Tokens of it had 
already appeared, for they had seen how Islam was daily advancing, and how all 
their efforts to check its progress had ended in failure.

and for the believing men and the believing women." And Allah 
knows your moving about and your staying (in a place). 

Section 3: The Weak-hearted Ones 

20 And those who believe say: Why is not a chapter revealed? c 
But when a decisive chapter is revealed, and fighting is mentioned 
in it, you see those in whose hearts is a disease look to you with 
the look of one fainting at death. So woe to them! 21 Obedience 
and a gentle word (was proper). Then when the affair is settled, it 
is better for them if they remain true to Allah. 22 But if you turn 
away, you are sure to make mischief in the land and cut off the 
ties of kinship! 23 Those it is whom Allah has cursed, so He has 
made them deaf and blinded their eyes. 6 

24 Do they not reflect on the Quran? Or, are there locks on 
the hearts? 25 Surely those who turn back after guidance is quite 
clear to them, the devil entices them (to do it) and lengthens false 
hopes for them. 26 That is because they say to those who hate what 
Allah has revealed: We will obey you in some matters. And Allah 
knows their secrets. 27 But how will it be when the angels cause 
them to die, striking their faces and their backs? 28 That is because 
they follow that which displeases Allah and dislike His pleasure, 
so He makes their deeds fruitless. 



a (19-1) Not only the Prophet but every believer is told here to keep praying 
to God for being protected from sins, for himself and for all the believers, men as 
well as women. See also 40:55, 48:2, and footnotes there. 

b (19-2) Moving about refers to people's going to and fro for the transaction 
of their affairs, and staying indicates taking rest. 

c (20) Muslims had been severely persecuted; they had been oppressed, slain 
and turned out of their homes. Hence they naturally desired to be allowed to 
defend themselves. By a chapter is meant a revelation allowing them to fight. 

d (22) It is the hypocrites who are addressed in these words. Tawallai-tum 
("turn away") may mean either that you turn your backs on the Divine command- 
ment to fight in defence of Truth or thatyou are put in authority. 

e (23) Note that Allah blinds the eyes of, and makes deaf, those who would 
not turn to the right way. The next verse makes it clear by saying that they do not 
reflect on the Quran, as if there were locks on their hearts. 



47 : 29 • AN EXHORTATION 635 

Section 4: An Exhortation 

29 Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think that Allah 
will not bring forth their spite? 30 And if We please, We could 
show them to you so that you should know them by their marks. 
And certainly j^ou can recognize them by the tone of (their) speech. 
And Allah knows your deeds. 31 And certainly We shall try you, 
till We know those among you who strive hard, and the steadfast, 
and manifest your news. 

32 Surely those who disbelieve and hinder (people) from 
Allah's way and oppose the Messenger after guidance is quite 
clear to them, cannot harm Allah in any way, and He will make 
their deeds fruitless. 33 you who believe, obey Allah and obey 
the Messenger and do not make your deeds null. 34 Surely those 
who disbelieve and hinder (people) from Allah's way, then die 
disbelievers, Allah will not forgive them. 35 And do not be weak- 
hearted so as to cry for peace — and you are the uppermost — and 
Allah is with you, and He will not bring your deeds to nothing. 

36 This world's life is only an idle sport and play, and if you 
believe and keep your duty He will give you your reward, and He 
does not ask of you your wealth. 37 If He should ask you for it and 
press you, you will be miserly, and He will bring forth your 
malice. a 38 Look! you are those who are called to spend in Allah's 
way, but some of you are miserly; and whoever is miserly, is 
miserly against his own soul. And Allah is Self-Sufficient and you 
are needy. And if you turn back He will bring in your place 
another people, then they will not be like you. 



a (37) At the end of v. 36, it is stated that God does not ask of people their 
wealth, while here they are told that if He should ask them for it, they would be 
miserly. The two statements do not contradict each other. V. 38 makes it clear that 
Allah, being Self-Sufficient, does not stand in need of people's wealth, so He does 
not ask of them their wealth for His needs. Yet great stress is laid on spending 
wealth, as it is for man's own good. This too is made clear in v. 38 — whoever is 
miserly, is miserly against his own soul. We are further told: You are needy. Man 
stands in need of making sacrifices for the good of his own soul and, if he does 
not make a sacrifice, he will suffer. There is no advancement in this world without 
a sacrifice, so if man has an urge for advancement, he must spend his wealth. 



Chapter 48 
Ai-Fath The Victory 

This chapter is entitled The Victory as it deals with the conquests of Islam, from 
the great moral victory gained by the truce of Hudaibiyah to the prophesied 
triumph of Islam over all other religions. The word victory occurs in v. 1 and 
elsewhere. It is remarkable that although Muslims had been victorious in 
several battles before, yet it is not those but a truce which is called a victory, 
indicating that the triumph of Islam lay in its moral conquests. The chapter 
begins by declaring the Hudaibiyah truce to be a victory, speaking of the 
success of the faithful and the allegiance they rendered to the Holy Prophet, 
and the disappointment of the hypocrites and idolators. It then deals with the 
excuses of the hypocrites and separates them from the faithful. It goes on to 
predict more victories in battles and ends with the important prophecy that 
Islam will triumph over all other religions of the world. This chapter was 
revealed in 6 A.H. 



Section 1 : Hudaibiyah Truce was a Victory 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Surely We have granted you a clear victory," 2 that Allah may 
cover for you yom (alleged) shortcomings in the past and those to 



a (1) The victory referred to is that gained by the truce at Hudaibiyah in 6 
A.H. The truce was a victory for the Muslims because it opened the way for the 
propagation of Islam, and by putting a stop to hostilities gave the opponents an 
occasion to ponder over the merits of the religion against which they had hitherto 
struggled on the field of battle. As a result of this truce large numbers came over 
to Islam, and the words are thus prophetical, and their truth was demonstrated long 
after their revelation. The conditions of the truce to which Muslims yielded were 
disadvantageous to them, one being that if anyone from among the people of 
Makkah came over to the Holy Prophet, he would return him to the Quraish, though 
he were a Muslim, while the Quraish were not bound to return anyone who deserted 
the Prophet and joined the Quraish. The Muslims felt it very hard that one of their 
brethren should be returned to suffer persecution, but as the Quraish refused to 
make a truce unless this condition was included, the Holy Prophet accepted it. 
Immediately afterwards Divine revelation dispelled all those misgivings, and 
declared the truce to be a great victory, as it actually proved to be.

4 He it is Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the 
believers that they might add faith to their faith. And Allah's are 
the forces of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is ever Know- 
ing, Wise — 5 that He may make the believers, men and women, 
enter Gardens in which rivers flow, to abide in them, and remove 
from them their evil. And that is a mighty achievement with Allah, 
6 and (that) He may punish the hypocrites, men and women, and 
the idolaters, men and women, who entertain evil thoughts about 
Allah. On them is the evil turn, and Allah is furious with them and 



a (2-1) The word dhanb means any shortcoming, not necessarily a sin, and 
dhanbi-ka here does not mean your sin but the sin committed against you or the 
shortcoming attributed to you. The Prophet never committed a sin and the word 
ghafr here means covering or protecting against the commission of sins; see 40:55 
footnote. These were the shortcomings attributed to the Prophet by his enemies, 
among his contemporaries and those who were yet to come after him. Despite the 
fact that the Prophet was respected throughout Arabia for his righteousness and 
truthfulness before he laid claim to prophethood, the twenty years of opposition to 
the Truth which he brought had poisoned the minds of the Arabs to such an extent 
that they now drew a very dark picture of him, heaping all kinds of abuses on him. 
The battles that were now being fought had, further, made it impossible for the 
Muslims to present a true picture of Islam to the Arabs. After several years of 
conflict, the Hudaibiyah truce brought about a change in the relations of the two 
parties and the truth about the Prophet now began to dawn on their minds. They 
now saw that the Prophet was not the man of terror as their leaders had pictured to 
them. They saw the great transformation which he had wrought and the life which 
he had infused into a dead nation. It was in this sense that God covered the short- 
comings and failures which his opponents attributed to him. In the words those to 
come, there is a reference to the latter-day criticism of the enemies of Islam and a 
promise here that not only would those misunderstandings which already existed 
be corrected, but even those that would be spread at a later date by the enemies of 
Islam would also be dispelled, and Islam would thus shine in its full lustre not 
only in Arabia but in the whole world. 

b (2-2) The completion of favours was accomplished by the spread of Islam, 
and the guiding on the right path signified the right way to success. 

c (3) Large numbers becoming converts to Islam proved a mighty help in its 
cause. While proceeding to Hudaibiyah the Holy Prophet was accompanied by 
1,500 men; two years later, when advancing on Makkah, 10,000 men marched 
under his banner, which shows how fast Islam spread after the Hudaibiyah truce.

and Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. 

8 Surely We have sent ^ou as a witness and as a bearer of good 
news and as a warner, 'that you (people) may believe in Allah and 
His Messenger and may aid him and revere him. And (that) you 
may declare His glory, morning and evening. 10 Those who swear 
allegiance toj^ou only swear allegiance to Allah. The hand of Allah 
is above their hands. So whoever breaks (his faith), he breaks it 
only to his soul's detriment. And whoever fulfils his covenant with 
Allah, He will grant him a mighty reward. 

Section 2: The Defaulters 

11 Those of the dwellers of the desert who lagged behind will 
say to you: Our property and our families kept us busy, so ask 
forgiveness for us. They say with their tongues what is not in their 
hearts. Say: Then who can control anything at all for you from 
Allah, if He intends to do you harm or if He intends to do you 
good. Indeed, Allah is ever Aware of what you do. 12 No, you 
thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return 
to their families, and that was made pleasing in your hearts, and 
you thought an evil thought, and you are a people doomed to 
perish.* 13 And whoever does not believe in Allah and His 
Messenger — then surely We have prepared burning Fire for the 
disbelievers. 14 And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and 



a (10) The swearing of allegiance referred to here took place before the truce 
was concluded. The Holy Prophet had started with his men with the object of 
performing a pilgrimage, but when he reached Hudaibiyah, the Makkans opposed 
his entry into Makkah. Thereupon the companions of the Holy Prophet swore 
allegiance to him (under a tree as stated in v. 18), that they would defend him at 
all costs and die fighting at his side (Bukhari, 64:37). The necessity for this seems 
to have arisen from the fact that the Quraish advanced to fight the Muslims, who 
were unprepared for war. 

b (12) Even as late as 6 A.H. Muslims were so weak, as compared with their 
enemies, that whenever they had to go into the field, the weak-hearted thought 
that the Muslims were going into the very jaws of death. 



48 : 15 • MORE VICTORIES FOR ISLAM 639 

the earth. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He 
pleases. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 

15 Those who lagged behind will say, when you set forth to 
acquire gains: Allow us to follow you. They desire to change the 
word of Allah. Say: You shall not follow us. Thus did Allah say 
before. But they will say: Indeed, you are jealous of us. No, they 
do not understand but a little. 16 Say to those of the dwellers of the 
desert who lagged behind: You will soon be called against a people 
of mighty prowess to fight against them until they submit. Then if 
you obey, Allah will grant you a good reward; but, if you turn 
back as you turned back before, He will punish you with a painful 
punishment." 17 There is no blame on the blind, nor is there blame 
on the lame, nor is there blame on the sick. And whoever obeys 
Allah and His Messenger, He will make him enter Gardens in 
which rivers flow. And whoever turns back, He will punish him 
with a painful punishment. 

Section 3: More Victories for Islam 

18 Allah indeed was well pleased with the believers, when 
they swore allegiance to you under the tree, and He knew what was 
in their hearts, so He sent down tranquillity on them and rewarded 
them with a near victory, 19 and many gains which they will 
acquire. And Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. 20 AUah promised you 
many gains which you will acquire, then He hastened this on for 
you, and held back the hands of people from you; and that it may 
be a sign for the believers and that He may guide you on a right 
path, e 21 and others which you have not yet been able to achieve 



a (16) The power of the Makkan enemy was now broken, as was proved by 
the advance on Makkah two years later. Hence, the defaulters are told that they 
would be called on to join the forces of Islam against another powerful enemy. 
This appears to be a reference to the wars against the Roman and Persian empires 
in the time of the early Caliphs, again referred to in v. 2 1 . 

b (19) These many gains predict the later conquests of the Muslims, begin- 
ning with the conquest of Makkah which made the Muslims masters of Arabia, 
and then extending to other countries, both in the East and the West. 

c (20) By this truce the hands of people were held back from the Muslims,

ful over all things." 

22 And if those who disbelieve fight with you, they will 
certainly turn (their) backs, then they will find no protector nor

and you will not find a change in Allah's course. 24 And He it is 
Who held back their hands from you and your hands from them in 
the valley of Makkah after He had given you victory over them. 
And Allah is ever Seer of what you do. 

25 It is they who disbelieved and debarred you from the 
Sacred Mosque — and the offering withheld from reaching its 
destination. And if it were not for the believing men and the 
believing women, whom, not knowing them, you might have 
trodden down so that a harm might have afflicted you on their 
account unknowingly — that Allah may admit to His mercy 
whom He pleases. If they had been apart, We would surely have 

i.e., the Muslims were not persecuted any more. So persecution having ceased, 
people began to enter Islam in large numbers. This was moreover an indication that 
the promised conquests of Islam were not only conquests of countries but also 
conquests of hearts. 

a (21) This refers to the great Muslim conquests under the successors of the 
Holy Prophet. The defeat of the enemy is plainly spoken of in the next verse. 

b (24) This is again a reference to the Hudaibiyah truce. Three times already 
had the disbelievers attacked Madinah with very strong forces to crush Islam, and 
Muslims had repulsed them every time, inflicting severe loss on them. This is 
referred to in the words, after He had given you victory over them. Yet they 
offered terms which were humiliating to the Muslims and the Prophet accepted 
them to avoid bloodshed, so deeply did he love peace. The chief terms of the 
agreement were: (1) That the Muslims should return without performing a pil- 
grimage. (2) That they should be allowed to perform a pilgrimage next year, but 
should not stay for more than three days. (3) That if a disbeliever, being conver- 
ted, went over to the Muslims, he should be returned, but if a Muslim went over 
to the disbelievers he should not be given back to the Muslims (Bukhari, 54:15). 
The last term of the agreement was specially dissatisfying to the Muslims; but it 
shows the strong conviction which the Holy Prophet had in the truth of Islam, for 
he was confident that none of his companions would go over to disbelief and join 
the Quraish; and also that those who became converts to Islam would not desert it 
on account of persecution.

punished those who disbelieved from among them with a painful 
punishment." 26 When those who disbelieved harboured disdain in 
their hearts, the disdain of (the days of) Ignorance, but Allah sent 
down His tranquillity on His Messenger and on the believers and 
made them keep the word of observance of duty, and they were 
entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allah is ever Knower of all 
things. 

Section 4: Ultimate Triumph of Islam 

27 Allah indeed fulfilled the vision for His Messenger with 
truth. You shall certainly enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah please, 
in security, your heads shaved and hair cut short, not fearing. But 
He knows what you do not know, so He has ordained a near 
victory before that. 28 He it is Who has sent His Messenger with 
the guidance and the Religion of Truth that He may make it prevail 
over all religions. And Allah is enough for a witness. e 



a (25) One of the reasons given here for the truce is that the welfare of the 
Muslims demanded it, inasmuch as there were Muslims at Makkah who were 
unknown even to their brethren at Madinah, and that, if a battle had taken place, 
they would have suffered along with the enemy. This shows how Islam was making 
silent progress at Makkah itself, even without the guidance of a preacher, and in 
spite of persecution. 

b (27) The Holy Prophet's journey to Makkah to perform a pilgrimage with 
1,500 of his companions was undertaken on the basis of the vision stated here. In 
a vision, the Prophet had seen himself and his companions performing a pilgri- 
mage. Convinced of the truth of his vision, he set out with about 1,500 of his 
companions with the object of performing a pilgrimage. The Makkans, however, 
opposed him at Hudaibiyah, and a truce was there arranged, according to which 
the Holy Prophet had to return without performing a pilgrimage. The truth of the 
vision is therefore asserted here. It is made clear that the Prophet's return did not 
falsify the vision, which had to be, and was, fulfilled next year. The near victory 
before that, i.e., before the vision was fulfilled during the following year, is the 
conquest of Khaibar which happened in the month of Safar in 7 A.H. 

c (28) This prophecy of the prevalence of Islam over all other religions is a 
prophecy which extends into the distant future, while Arabia saw its fulfilment in 
the lifetime of the Holy Prophet. The prevalence of Islam does not, however, 
mean the political supremacy of its adherents at all times, nor does the prophecy 
signify that other religions would at any time entirely disappear. It only indicates 
that the superiority of the religion of Islam over all other religions will at last be

earth. See also 9:33; 61:9. 

a (29) The word ashidda ' used here means firm, strong, powerful, as well as 
brave, firm of heart. The translation fierce, vehement, or harsh, adopted in many 
English translations, is not correct here. The Muslims stood firm against the dis- 
believers but they were never fierce or hard in their treatment towards them. 



Chapter 49 
Ai-Hujurat The Apartments 

This chapter takes its title from v. 4 which tells Muslims not to call out to the 
Holy Prophet from behind the private apartments. It opens by teaching good 
manners and good morals when large masses of people began to enter Islam. 
The new converts should appreciate the value of the Holy Prophet's time and 
have respect for not only his privacy but for each other's privacy. It goes on 
to teach some social virtues and the avoidance of certain vices which are the 
curse of a society living in ease and comfort. It also removes all ideas of 
superiority based on race, tribe or family and declares that with Allah what 
distinguishes a person is righteousness. This chapter was revealed at Madinah 
in9A.H. 



Section 1 : Respect for the Prophet 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O you who believe, do not be forward in the presence of 
Allah and His Messenger, and keep your duty to Allah. Surely 
Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 2 you who believe, do not raise your 
voices above the Prophet's voice, nor speak loudly to him as you 
speak loudly to one another, in case your deeds become fruitless, 
while you do not perceive. 3 Surely those who lower their voices 
before Allah's Messenger are they whose hearts Allah has proved 
for dutifulness. For them is forgiveness and a great reward. 4 Those 
who call out to you from behind the private apartments, most of 
them have no sense. c 5 And if they had patience till you come out 



a (1) The presence of Allah means the presence of His commandments. The 
words imply the utmost obedience. 

b (2) The Quran not only inculcates high morals but also regulates social 
conduct, because its teachings are intended for all grades of people. When large 
numbers of people began to enter Islam such directions became necessary. A loud 
voice is expressive of arrogance or resentment. 

c (4) When masses of people began to enter Islam many of them were igno- 
rant even of the ordinary social rules, and they called out to the Prophet with loud

Merciful. 

6 O you who believe, if an unrighteous person brings you news, 
look carefully into it, in case you harm a people in ignorance, then 
be sorry for what you did." 7 And know that among you is Allah's 
Messenger. If he were to obey you in many a matter, you would 
surely fall into distress; but Allah has endeared the faith to you 
and has made it attractive in your hearts, and He has made hateful 
to you disbelief and transgression and disobedience. Such are 
those who are rightly guided — 8 a grace from Allah and a favour. 
And Allah is Knowing, Wise. 

9 And if two groups of the believers quarrel, make peace 
between them. Then if one of them does wrong to the other, fight 
the one which does wrong, till it returns to Allah's command. 
Then, if it returns, make peace between them with justice and act 
equitably. Surely Allah loves the equitable.* 10 The believers are 
brethren so make peace between your brethren, and keep your 
duty to Allah that mercy may be shown to you.

disrespect to the Holy Prophet. 

a (6) Such a direction was expedient when a condition of war necessitated 
prompt action to be taken against the enemy. But even the exigencies of war were 
to be carried out with the utmost carefulness, so that friendly people should not 
suffer loss. 

b (9) This verse requires Muslims not to be indifferent when one group of 
them quarrels with another. They must bring every kind of pressure to bear upon 
the party in error. It is the duty of every Muslim to maintain the unity of Islam. 
An attitude of indifference towards fatwas of kufr (heresy), directed against their 
own brethren by ignorant Mullas (clerics), has dealt a fatal blow to the union of 
Muslim brotherhood, and, if Muslims do not raise their voice against these fatwas, 
they must never hope to make any progress towards real union.

not believe, but say, "We submit"; and faith has not yet entered 
into your hearts. And if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He

a (11) This verse and those that follow deal with some of the evils which are 
most rampant in civilized society, and which corrupt a society to its core. 

b (13) The principle of the brotherhood of mankind laid down here is on the 
broadest basis. The address here is not to believers, as in the two previous verses, 
but to mankind in general, who are told that they are all, as it were, members of 
one family, and their divisions into nations, tribes and families should not lead to 
estrangement from, but to a better knowledge of, each other. Superiority of one 
over another in this vast brotherhood does not depend on nationality, wealth, or 
rank, but on the careful observance of duty, or moral greatness. 

c (14) Here Muslims are enjoined to deal kindly and leniently, even with 
those who, being novices, were not yet really grounded in the faith, though they 
were members of the Muslim brotherhood. Faith had not yet entered into their 
hearts, but they were to be regarded as Muslims. The solidarity of Islam is being 
shattered today by narrow-minded Mullas (clerics) who, on one pretext or another, 
issue fatwas of kufr against this or that party of Muslims.

Chapter 50 
Qaf 

This chapter takes its name from its initial letter Qaf referring to the great 
power of God, and deals with the Resurrection, both the spiritual resurrection 
of this life and the greater Resurrection of the life after death. It begins by 
drawing attention to the testimony of nature and then to the fate of some 
former peoples. Then it shows that every action has a consequence and these 
consequences are made manifest on the day of Judgment. Finally, it states 
that the good and the bad must receive their due, and refers to the two re- 
surrections. From the 50th to the 56th chapter, there is a group of seven 
chapters all belonging to the early period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : The Resurrection — Signs in Nature 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Almighty (God)!" By the glorious Quran! 2 Yet they wonder 
that a warner has come to them from among themselves; so the 
disbelievers say: This is a wonderful thing! 3 When we die and 
become dust — that is a far return. 4 We know indeed what the 
earth diminishes of them and with Us is a book that preserves/ 
5 But they reject the Truth when it comes to them, so they are in a 
state of confusion. 

6 Do they not look at the sky above them? — how We have 
made it and adorned it and it has no flaws. 7 And the earth, We 



a (1-1) The letter Qaf, with which v. 1 begins, stands for the name Qadir (or 
Qadir) of the Divine Being, meaning Omnipotent or All-Powerful, or for al- 
Qiyamat, the Resurrection. 

b (1-2) An expression of wonder at the disbelief of people. The whole of the 
Quran is spoken of as one book even at this early period. 

c (4) What the earth diminishes is the body, dust going to dust. The book that 
preserves is the record of the deeds which a person has done. The consequences 
of deeds are preserved in their entirety and out of them grows a new life in the 
Resurrection.

have spread it out, and cast in it mountains, and We have made to 
grow in it (things) of every beautiful kind — 8 as an insight and a 
reminder to every servant who turns (to Allah). 9 And We send 
down from the clouds water abounding in good, then We cause to 
grow with it gardens and the grain that is reaped, 10 and the tall 
palm-trees having flower spikes piled one above another — 
n a sustenance for the servants, and We give life with it to a dead 
land. Thus is the rising." 

12 Before them the people of Noah rejected (the Truth) and 
(so did) the dwellers of Rass and Thamud 13 and Ad and Pharaoh 
and Lot's brethren, 14 and the dwellers of the grove and the people 
of Tubba.' They all rejected the messengers, so My threat came to 
pass. 15 Were We then fatigued with the first creation? Yet they are 
in doubt about a new creation. c 

Section 2: The Resurrection — Consequences made manifest 

16 And certainly We created man, and We know what his mind 
suggests to him — and We are nearer to him than his life-vein. 
17 When the two receivers receive, sitting on the right and on the 
left, 18 he does not utter a word but there is by him a watcher at 
hand. 19 And the stupor of death comes in truth; that is what you 
would try to avoid. 20 And the trumpet is blown. That is the day of 
threatening. 21 And every soul comes, with it a driver and a 
witness. e 22 Tou were indeed heedless of this, but now We have 



a (11) The rising here includes both the spiritual resurrection of a dead 
people in this life and also the greater Resurrection in a life after death. 

b (14) For the dwellers of Rass, see 25:38 footnote; for dwellers of the 
grove, 15:78 footnote; for Tubba, 44:37 footnote. 

c (15) The meaning is that Allah did not lack power in dealing with the 
former generations so that they should doubt His power in dealing with a new 
one. Or, the first creation is the physical creation of man, and the second creation 
his spiritual regeneration. 

d (18) The three verses 16-18 impress upon man that all his deeds and words 
bear fruit, that nothing is said or done in vain. 

e (21) The driver signifies the impeller to evil, and the witness the caller to 
the truth. 



50 : 23 • THE RESURRECTION 649 



removed from you your veil, so jour sight is sharp this day." 

23 And his companion will say: This is what is ready with me. 
24 Cast into hell every ungrateful, rebellious one, 25 forbidder of 
good, exceeder of limits, doubter, 26 who sets up another god with 
Allah, so cast him into severe punishment. 27 His companion will 
say: Our Lord, I did not cause him to rebel but he himself went far 
in error. 28 He will say: Do not dispute in My presence, and indeed 
I gave you warning beforehand. 29 My sentence cannot be changed, 
nor am I in the least unjust to the servants. 

Section 3: The Resurrection 

30 On the day when We say to hell: Are you filled up? And it 
will say: Are there any more? e 31 And the Garden is brought near 
for those who guard against evil — (it is) not distant. 32 This is 
what you are promised — for everyone turning (to Allah), keeping 
(the limits) — 33 who fears the Beneficent in secret, and comes 
with a penitent heart: 34 Enter it in peace. That is the day of abid- 
ing. 35 They shall have in it all they wish, and with Us is yet more/ 



a (22) This verse shows clearly that the consequences of evil actions which 
remain hidden from the human eye in this life are made manifest after death. This 
is the significance of the sight being made sharp, so that man will then see what 
he is unable to see here. Such is hell, according to the teachings of the Quran, 
namely, the hidden consequences of evil deeds, when made manifest to a person, 
become his hell. 

b (23) The evil companion or the devil is meant, at whose suggestion a 
person commits evil deeds. What is ready is the record of man's evil deeds, which 
will be palpably manifest to him on the day of Resurrection. 

c (30) This is metaphorical. One people after another continue to do evil 
without taking a lesson from the fate of previous people. It is also an expression 
of man's desire to have more and more of wealth and material comfort. 

d (31) If a person used his inner sight, he could see that the keeping away 
from evil and the doing of good brought him nearer and nearer to true happiness, 
for which the Garden stands here, in this very life. 

e (35) This is to show that the doing of good gives man all that he desires. 
But as his desires are limited, he is told that God will give him more than he 
desires. This is explained by some as meaning the sight of the Divine Being, 
which is the highest blessing of the next life. 



650 50. QAF • 50 : 36 

36 And how many a generation We destroyed before them who 
were mightier in prowess than they, so they went about in the lands! 
Is there a place of refuge? 37 Surely there is a reminder in this for 
him who has a heart or he listens and is a witness. 

38 And certainly We created the heavens and the earth and all 
that is between them in six periods, and no fatigue touched Us. a 
39 So bear patiently what they say, and celebrate the praise of your 
Lord before the rising of the sun and before the setting. 40 And 
glorify Him in the night and after prostration. 

41 And listen on the day when the crier cries from a near 
place — 42 the day when they hear the cry in truth. That is the day 
of coming forth. e 43 Surely We give life and cause to die, and to 
Us is the eventual coming — 44 the day when the earth splits apart 
from (under) them, they hastening forth. That is a gathering easy 
to Us. 45 We know best what they say, and you are not one to 
compel them. So remind by means of the Quran him who fears 
My threat/ 



a (38) The Bible says: "And He rested on the seventh day from all His work 
which He had made" (Genesis, 2:2). The Quran negatives any such idea in rela- 
tion to God, Who does not stand in need of rest: No fatigue touched Us. For the 
creation of the heavens and the earth in six periods or six days, see 7:54. 

b (40) Prostration here stands for prayer. The significance is that one should 
not get tired of glorifying God; prayer is in its entirety a glorification of God, but 
even after prayer, one should continue the glorification of God. 

c (42) The crier (v. 41) is the Prophet; see 3:193: "Our Lord, surely we have 
heard a Crier calling to the Faith, saying: Believe in your Lord". This cry was a 
distant cry at first, but, as we are told in v. 41, it will be a cry from a near place in 
the end, so that people will listen to it in truth. Note that the spiritual resurrection 
to be brought about in this life by the Prophet is spoken of in the whole of this 
chapter, along with the greater Resurrection of the next life. 

d (45) The words, you are not one to compel them, refer plainly to the spiri- 
tual resurrection, which the Prophet desired to see immediately; he is told that he 
will see the dead coming to life but he could not compel people to accept the 
truth. The splitting apart of the earth in v. 44 and their hastening forth to life spiri- 
tual and their gathering in Islam were all witnessed in the lifetime of the Prophet, 
and may be witnessed again in the near future. This spiritual resurrection is 
treated as an evidence of the greater Resurrection, and that is the reason why both 
resurrections are spoken of in the same words. 



Chapter 5 1 
Ai-DMriyat The Scatterers 

The title of this chapter is taken from the mention of The Scatterers of Truth 
in the first verse. It opens by drawing attention to the gradual advancement of 
the Truth and the certainty of the judgment of the rejectors. Then it speaks of 
the news given to Abraham of the birth of a son, standing for the birth of a 
nation of the righteous, and goes on to relate the fate of some previous 
nations. It ends by warning the opponents that their good fortune is about to 
be ended and they shall be judged. This chapter belongs to the early period at 
Makkah. 



Section 1 : Falsehood is doomed 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By those scattering far and wide! 2 And those bearing the 
load! 3 And those running easily! 4 And those distributing the 
Affair! — 5 What you are promised is surely true, 6 and the Judg- 
ment will surely come to pass." 

7 By the heaven full of paths! 8 Surely you are of varying 
opinion — 9 he is turned away from it who would (himself) be 



a (6) In verses 1-4, attention is called to certain facts by means of an oath, 
for which see 37:1, while verses 5-6 indicate the conclusion to which those facts 
lead. V. 1 refers to the winds that raise up dust before the coming of a cloud; v. 2 
to the clouds that carry rain; v. 3 to the winds that carry the clouds along, and v. 4 
to the winds that distribute the rain. This indicates a similar arrangement in the 
spiritual world by which Truth gradually advances. Attention is drawn here to the 
scattering of Truth broadcast through the Holy Prophet and his faithful followers, 
which led to some bearing the load of it as if they had become pregnant with 
Truth, while others ran easily towards its acceptance. But they were not satisfied 
with mere acceptance; they went to and fro to deliver to others the Truth and the 
Light which they had received. In the existence of these workers in the cause of 
Truth there was a clear sign that the triumph of Islam would soon take place. 

b (7) The description of heaven as full of paths is a scientific truth certainly 
unknown to the world at the time of the revelation of the Quran.

turned away." 10 Cursed be the liars, 11 who are in an abyss, neglect- 
ful; 12 they ask: When is the day of Judgment? 13 (It is) the day 
when they are tried at the Fire. 14 Taste your persecution! This is 
what you would hasten on. 

15 Surely the dutiful are amidst Gardens and fountains, 
16 taking what their Lord gives them. Surely they were before that 
the doers of good. 17 They used to sleep but little at night. 18 And in 
the morning they asked (Divine) protection. 19 And in their wealth 
there was a due share for the beggar and for one who is deprived 
(of good). e 

20 And in the earth are signs for those who are sure, 21 and in 
yourselves — do you not see? 22 And in the heavens is your 
sustenance and what you are promised. 23 So by the Lord of the 
heavens and the earth! It is surely the truth, just as you speak. 6 

Section 2: The Fate of Previous Nations 

24 Has the story of Abraham's honoured guests reached you? 
25 When they came to him, they said: 'Peace!' 'Peace!' said he. 
Strangers! 26 Then he turned aside to his family and brought a fat 
calf. 27 So he placed it before them. He said: Will you not eat? 28 So 
he conceived a fear of them. They said: Do not fear. And they 



a (9) Only those are turned away from the Truth who themselves turn away. 

b (14) Tasting of persecution signifies receiving punishment for their perse- 
cution of the Muslims. 

c (19) The word mahriim, "deprived", is understood by some to mean a poor 
man who does not beg, and by others, one who has not the faculty of speech, like 
the dog and the cat. Note that the poor are here spoken of as having a share in the 
wealth of the rich. The State is bound to take that share and make it over to the 
poor. But it is only a share, not the whole. 

rf(22) What is promised may mean the spiritual sustenance as contrasted 
with physical sustenance. Or, it may refer to the Judgment, of which they were 
warned again and again. 

e (23) Note the high degree of certainty, the unshakable faith in the ultimate 
triumph of the Truth at this early period. Just as people's speaking to each other is 
a reality, even so is God's speaking to man. 

/ (24) See 11:69 footnote.

gave him the good news of a boy possessing knowledge. 29 Then 
his wife came up in grief, and she struck her face and said: A barren 
old woman! 30 They said: So says your Lord. Surely He is the Wise, 
the Knowing.

31 He said: What is your errand, messengers! 32 They said: We 
have been sent to a guilty people 33 that we may send upon them 
^3 stones of clay, 34 marked from your Lord for those who commit 
excesses. 35 Then We brought forth such believers as were there. 
36 And We found there only one house of Muslims. 37 And We left 
there a sign for those who fear the painful punishment. 

38 And in Moses (was another sign), when We sent him to 
Pharaoh with clear authority. 39 But he turned away on account of 
his might and said: An enchanter or a madman! 40 So We seized 
him and his armies and hurled them into the sea, and he was 
blameable. 41 And in Ad, when We sent upon them the destructive 
wind. 42 It spared nothing that it came against, but it made it like 
ashes. 43 And in Thamud, when it was said to them: Enjoy your- 
selves for a while. 44 But they revolted against the commandment 
of their Lord, so the punishment overtook them, while they saw. e 
45 So they were unable to rise up, nor could they defend them- 
selves; 46 and the people of Noah before. Surely they were a trans- 
gressing people. 

Section 3: Judgment is Sure 

47 And the heaven, We raised it high with power, and We 
have made the vast extent. 48 And the earth, We have spread it out. 
How well We prepared it! 49 And of everything We have created 
pairs that you may be mindful. 



a (34) For the punishment sent on Lot's people, see 7:84 footnote. The 
stones were marked, i.e., they were destined for them. 

b (36) It is said to be the house of Lot himself. A Muslim is one who submits 
himself to God, and in this sense all prophets and their righteous followers were 
Muslims. 

c (44) See 7:78.

50 So flee to Allah. Surely I am a plain warner to you from 
Him. 51 And do not set up with Allah another god. Surely I am a 
plain warner to you from Him. 52 Thus, no messenger came to 
those before them but they said: An enchanter or a madman! 
53 Have they charged each other with this? Indeed, they are an 
inordinate people. 54 So turn away from them, for you are not to 
blame;" 55 and remind, for reminding benefits the believers. 

56 And I have not created the jinn and the people except that 
they should serve Me. 57 I desire no sustenance from them, nor do I 
desire that they should feed Me. 58 Surely Allah is the Provider of 
sustenance, the Lord of Power, the Strong. 59 Surely the lot of the 
wrongdoers is as was the lot of their companions, so let them not 
ask Me to hasten (it) on. 60 Woe, then, to those who disbelieve 
because of that day of theirs which they are promised! 



a (54) Turning away from them means to pay no heed to their abuses and to 
disregard their reviling. The words that follow make this clear, for the Prophet is 
enjoined to continue to remind, for there will be some who will believe, and these 
will profit by the reminder. 



Chapter 52 
Ai-Tm The Mountain 

The name of this chapter is taken from the first verse where the mention of 
The Mountain is an indication of a similarity between the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad and Moses. The chapter tells us that while punishment must 
befall the Holy Prophet's opponents as it did the opponents of Moses, the 
faithful will be rewarded with success. It ends with a clear mention of the 
doom of the opponents in this very life. This chapter belongs to the early 
period at Makkah. 



Section 1: Success of the Faithful 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By the Mountain! 2 And a Book written 3 on unfolded 
vellum! 4 And the frequented House, 5 and the elevated canopy, 
6 and the swollen sea! 7 The punishment of jour Lord will surely 
come a — 8 there is none to avert it; 9 on the day when the heaven 
will be in a state of commotion, 10 and the mountains will pass 
away, fleeing. 



a (7) Verses 1-6 draw attention to parallels in the revelations of Moses and 
the Holy Prophet Muhammad. The mount in the one case is Mt. Sinai, and in the 
other the mount Hira, the Book stands for the Torah in the one case and the Quran 
in the other; the House that is frequented and the elevated canopy refer, on the one 
hand, to the tabernacle raised by Moses for the Israelites as a sacred place, where 
they worshipped God and offered sacrifices, and on the other to the Sacred House 
at Makkah, which was to be the centre of the Muslims of all nations, all countries, 
and all ages, and where they were to offer sacrifices. The swollen sea represents 
the sea which brought destruction to Pharaoh and his armies, while the Holy Pro- 
phet's enemies are told in the next verse that the punishment of their Lord would 
as surely overtake them on land as it overtook the enemies of Moses in the swollen 
sea. The whole passage draws attention to the close similarity of the revelations of 
Moses and the Holy Prophet, and warns the disbelievers that their power will be 
brought to naught, as it was in the case of Pharaoh. 

b (10) The great transformation that was to be brought about by the Holy 
Prophet Muhammad, the sweeping away of the old order of superstition, ignorance

11 Woe on that day to the deniers, 12 who amuse themselves 
by idle talk. 13 The day when they are driven to hell-fire with 
violence. 14 This is the Fire, which you used to deny. 15 Is it magic 
or do you not see? 16 Burn in it; then bear (it) patiently, or do not 
bear (it), it is the same to you. You are recompensed only for what 
you did. 

17 The dutiful will be surely in Gardens and bliss, 18 rejoicing 
because of what their Lord has given them; and their Lord saved 
them from the punishment of the burning Fire. 19 Eat and drink 
with pleasure for what you did, 20 reclining on thrones set in lines, 
and We shall join them to pure, beautiful ones." 21 And those who 
believe and whose offspring follow them in faith — We unite with 
them their offspring and We shall not deprive them of any of their 
work. Every man is pledged for what he does. 22 And We shall 



and vice, and its replacement by light, learning and righteousness, the overthrow 
of a wicked generation and the ushering in of a new era, is here represented as the 
commotion of the heaven and the passing away of the mountains; see 20:105. 

a (20) Two points here must be borne in mind. Firstly, paradise is a place for 
faithful women as well as for faithful men, and hence the Quran often speaks of 
the faithful as being in paradise with their wives; see 13:23, 36:56, 40:8 and 
43:70. Secondly, the blessings of paradise are alike for women and men, there 
being not the least difference in this respect between the two sexes; see 4:124, 
9:72 and 57:12. As to what is meant by "pure, beautiful ones" (in Arabic hur and 
In), wherever blessings of paradise are spoken of, these are nothing but physical 
manifestations of the spiritual blessings which the doers of good enjoy in this life 
too. The gardens, trees, rivers, milk, honey, fruits and numerous other blessings 
spoken of as being met with in paradise are not things of this life. See further 
32:17 footnote. Thus the "pure, beautiful ones" are not actually the beautiful 
women of this life but these are heavenly blessings which the righteous women 
shall have along with the righteous men, for v. 17 plainly says that those who 
keep their duty will find these blessings. 

These blessings are described in words which apply to women because the 
reward spoken of here is one having special reference to the purity of character 
and the beautiful deeds of the righteous, and it is womanhood which stands for a 
symbol of purity and beauty. Moreover, note that in Arabic salihat and tayyibat 
signify good deeds and pure things as well as good women and pure women. 

b (21) Those who have done great deeds of sacrifice are united with their 
offspring because even their children follow their footsteps and do the deeds their

aid them with fruit and flesh, as they desire. 23 They pass therein 
from one to another a cup, in which there is neither idle talk, nor 
sin." 24 And round them go boys of theirs as if they were hidden 
pearls. 4 25 And they will advance to each other, questioning — 
26 saying: Surely we feared before on account of our families/ 
27 But Allah has been gracious to us and He has saved us from the 
punishment of the hot wind. 28 Surely we called upon Him before. 
Surely He is the Benign, the Merciful. 

Section 2: Opponents are doomed 

29 So remind for, by the grace of your Lord, you are no sooth- 
sayer, nor madman. 30 Or say they: A poet — we wait for him the 
evil accidents of time. 31 Say: Wait, I too am waiting along with 
you. 32 0r do their understandings tell them this? Or are they an 
inordinate people? 33 0r say they: He has forged it. Indeed, they 
have no faith. 34 Then let them bring a saying like it, if they are 
truthful. 35 0r were they created without a (creative) agency? e Or 
are they the creators? 36 0r did they create the heavens and the 
earth? No, they are sure of nothing. 37 0r do they possess the 
treasures of your Lord with them? Or do they have absolute 
authority? ' 38 0r do they have the means by which they listen? 
Then let their listener bring a clear authority/ 39 0r does He have 



fathers did, reaping the benefit of those deeds. Note the clear doctrine of man's 
responsibility for his actions: "Every man is pledged for what he does". 

a (23) This cup is therefore entirely of a different nature from what is known 
in this life. 

b (24) These boys may either be the offspring of the faithful mentioned in v. 
21, or heavenly blessings of the nature discussed in v. 20 footnote. 

c (26) This clearly shows that righteous women will be in paradise along 
with righteous men. The difference of sex counts for nothing in the sight of Allah. 

d (34) So early did the Quran challenge its opponents to produce the like of 
it. See 2:23 footnote, as to the uniqueness of the Holy Quran. 

e (35) Or without a cause, or without a purpose. 

/(37) Their authority or power in the land would soon be brought to naught. 

g (38) The Arab astrologers and diviners pretended that they could listen to 
the secrets of the future, but their conjectures about the future failed to make any 
impression, as they did not turn out true. See also 15:17, 37:8, 67:5 and 72:8.

daughters and you have sons? 40 Or do you ask a reward from them 
so that they are over-burdened by a debt? 41 Or do they possess the 
unseen, so they write (it) down? " 42 0r do they intend a plot? But 
those who disbelieve will be the trapped ones in the plot. 6 43 0r do 
they have a god other than Allah? Glory be to Allah from what they 
set up as partners (with Him)! 

44 And if they were to see a portion of the heaven coming 
down, e they would say: Piled-up clouds! 45 Leave them then till 
they meet that day of theirs in which they are struck with punish- 
ment, 46 the day when their struggle will not avail them at all, nor 
will they be helped. 47 And surely for those who do wrong there 
is a punishment besides that, but most of them do not know. 6 
48 And wait patiently for the judgment of jour Lord, for surely you 
are before Our eyes, and celebrate the praise of your Lord, when 
you rise, 49 and in the night, glorify Him too, and at the setting of 
the stars. 



From what is said further on in v. 4 1 , and elsewhere, challenging them to put down 
their pretended knowledge of the unseen in writing, a challenge repeatedly given 
but never accepted, it is clear that the diviners themselves knew that what they 
said was no more than mere conjecture. 

a (41) Here we have a clear proof that from the very beginning the Quran was 
written down as it was revealed. This chapter is one of the very early revelations, 
and here we find the opponents challenged to write down prophecies relating to 
the future, the suggestion clearly being that the prophecies of the Quran relating 
to the future were handed over to them in a written form. 

b (42) Mark the clear language in which their vanquishment and the over- 
throw of their power is spoken of. 

c (44) By a portion of the heaven coming down upon them is meant a punish- 
ment from heaven, which they repeatedly demanded. See 17:92 and 26:187. 

d (46) Mark the clearness and force with which the prophecy is continued. 
The reference to war and their vanquishment in it is made clearer here. 

e (47) The two kinds of punishment with which the opponents were threat- 
ened are spoken of distinctly in this verse, namely, a punishment which was to 
overtake them in this very life in the form of famines and the wars which were to 
result in the complete overthrow of their power, and a punishment in the form of 
spiritual torment in another life. 

/(48) The judgment of the Lord signifies the punishment of the wicked. The 
Prophet is not to have any fear, for he is spoken of as being before Our eyes. 



Chapter 53 
Ai-Najm The Star 

The word Star, which gives its name to this chapter, occurs in the first verse. 
It states that the Holy Prophet Muhammad will rise to the highest eminence 
to which man can rise. Then it declares that nothing can avail against the 
Truth and refers to the power of God as manifested in the destruction of 
falsehood. The date of its revelation is the fifth year of the Holy Prophet's 
mission at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Eminence to be attained by the Prophet 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By the star when it sets! a 2 Your companion is not in error, 
nor does he deviate. 6 3 Nor does he speak out of desire. 4 It is 
nothing but revelation that is revealed c — 5 One Mighty in 
power has taught him, 6 the Lord of strength. So he attained to 



a (1) The best-known significance of najm is star, and when used as a proper 
noun it signifies the Pleiades. In the setting of the star the opponents are warned 
of the calamities which would soon overtake them; their star of fortune was about 
to set. A less-known significance is that the meaning of the word najm is a por- 
tion of the Quran, and the word hawa ("sets") means its revelation. The meaning 
in this case is that every portion of the Quran when it is revealed is an evidence 
that the Prophet is not in error — he is in the right. 

b (2) By your companion is meant the Prophet, who had led among this very 
people a life of unblemished purity. There are two statements made here; being in 
error on his part is denied in the first to show that he had a true knowledge or he 
did not err in theory, and deviation from the right course is denied in the second to 
show that he acted according to that knowledge, or his practice accorded with the 
theory. This verse is a conclusive proof that according to the Holy Quran the 
Prophet was perfectly sinless. 

c (4) The pronoun "it" here refers to the najm or portion of the Quran spoken 
of in v. 1. The Quran was not his word, for he spoke not out of his own desire; it 
was the word of God. 

d (5) The One Who taught him was God Himself as plainly stated elsewhere: 
"The Beneficent — He taught the Quran" (55:1-2).

perfection," 7 and he is in the highest part of the horizon. ' "Then 
he drew near, drew nearer yet, c 9 so he was the measure of two 
bows or closer still. 10 So He revealed to His servant what He 
revealed. 2 n The heart was not untrue in seeing what he saw. 12 Do 
you then dispute with him as to what he saw? 13 And certainly he 
saw Him in another descent, 14 at the farthest lote-tree. 15 Near it 
is the Garden of Abode. 16 When that which covers covered the 
lote-tree, 17 the eye did not turn aside, nor did it exceed the limit. 
18 Certainly he saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord. 

19 Have you then considered Lat and Uzza, 20 and another, the 
third, Manat? 21 Are the males for you and for Him the females? g 



a (6) The Holy Prophet is spoken of here as having attained to perfection 
because the Almighty Himself was his Teacher. 

b (7) The Prophet's being in the highest part of the horizon is in reference to 
the resplendence of his light, which was to illuminate all corners of the world — a 
prophecy that he will shine out in the full brilliance of his light as the midday sun. 

c (8) The verse points out that the Prophet attained the utmost nearness to 
God which it is possible for man to attain. 

d (9) The expression "measure of two bows" indicates close union. The two 
bows seem to indicate the Holy Prophet's twofold perfection, i.e., his nearness to 
the Divine Being and his humility in his relations with people. 

e (10) The word ma ("what") in "what He revealed", according to all commen- 
tators, indicates that a mighty revelation was given to him. 

/(14) This indicates a place beyond which human knowledge does not go. 
The significance conveyed by the words is that the Prophet's knowledge of things 
Divine was the utmost which could be vouchsafed to man. 

g (21) Verses 19-21 are made the basis of a false story that the devil inter- 
fered in the revelation at this point, so that instead of v. 21 the Holy Prophet read 
the words: "These are exalted females whose intercession is to be sought". But the 
insertion of these few words in a chapter which is wholly directed against idolatry 
is quite out of place: v. 23 condemns idols; v. 26 denies their intercession; v. 28 
condemns the giving of names of female deities to angels, and so on. It is further 
asserted that 22:52 was immediately revealed to explain that Allah nullified the 
devil's interference, but there is a period of at least eight years between the reve- 
lation of this verse and that of 22:52. Moreover, if the Prophet had made any such 
compromise, it could not have been a sudden event, and traces of it would have 
been met with in other chapters revealed about the same time. But a perusal of 
these shows clearly that the Quran's condemnation of idolatry was never marked 
by the slightest change. 



53 : 22 • NOTHING AVAILS AGAINST TRUTH 661 

22 This indeed is an unjust division! 23 They are nothing but names 
which you have named, you and your fathers — Allah has sent no 
authority for them. They follow only conjecture and what (their) 
souls desire. And certainly the guidance has come to them from 
their Lord. 24 0r shall man have what he wishes? 25 But for Allah is 
the Hereafter and the former (life). 

Section 2: Nothing avails against Truth 

26 And how many angels are in the heavens, whose inter- 
cession does not avail at all except after Allah gives permission to 
whom He pleases and chooses. 27 Surely those who do not believe 
in the Hereafter name the angels with female names." 28 And they 
have no knowledge of it. They follow only conjecture, and surely 
conjecture does not avail at all against Truth. 29 So shun him who 
turns his back upon Our Reminder, and desires nothing but this 
world's life. 30 That is their goal of knowledge. Surely your Lord 
knows best him who strays from His path and He knows best him 
who goes aright. 

31 And Allah's is whatever is in the heavens and whatever is 
in the earth, that He may reward those who do evil for what they 
do, and reward those who do good with goodness. 32 Those who 
avoid the great sins and the indecencies, but the passing idea — 
surely your Lord is Liberal in forgiving. He knows you best when 
He brings you forth from the earth and when you are embryos in 
the wombs of your mothers; so do not ascribe purity to yourselves. 
He knows him best who guards against evil. 

Section 3: Allah's Power manifested in destroying Falsehood 

33 Have you seen him who turns back, 34 and gives a little, 
then withholds? 35 Does he have the knowledge of the unseen so 
that he can see? 36 0r has he not been informed of what is in the 



a (27) The Arabs called the angels daughters of Allah. 

b (32) A passing idea which leaves no impression on the mind is forgiven, for 
a mortal cannot be proof against it. But this by no means amounts to an intention 
or an attempt to commit a sin.

scriptures of Moses, 37 and (of) Abraham who fulfilled (command- 
ments)? 38 — that no bearer of burden bears another's burden, 
39 and that man can have nothing but what he strives for, 40 and that 
his striving will soon be seen, 41 then he will be rewarded for it 
with the fullest reward, 42 and that to your Lord is the goal, 43 and 
that He it is Who makes (people) laugh and makes (them) weep, 
44 and that He it is Who causes death and gives life, 45 and that He 
creates pairs, the male and the female 46 from the small life-germ 
when it is adapted, 47 and that He has ordained the second bringing 
forth, 48 and that He it is Who gives wealth and contentment, 49 and 
that He is the Lord of Sirius, 50 and that He destroyed the first Ad, a 
51 and Thamud, so He did not spare, 52 and the people of Noah 
before, surely they were most unjust and inordinate, 53 and the 
overthrown cities, He hurled down, 54 so there covered them that 
(punishment) which covered. 55 Which, then, of your Lord's bene- 
fits will you dispute? 

56 This is a warner like the earlier warners. 57 The near Event 
draws nearer. 58 There is none besides Allah to remove it. 59 Do 
you wonder then at this announcement? 60 And do you laugh and 
not weep, "while you sport? 62 So bow down in prostration before 
Allah and serve (Him). 



a (50) The tribe of Ad is sometimes referred to as the first Ad, in contrast 
with Thamud, who are called the second Ad. 

b (57) The near Event is the doom of the Quraish, the overthrow of their 
power, which was now being utilized against Islam. 



Chapter 54 

Al-Qamar The M00I1 

The Moon, the title of this chapter taken from the occurrence of this word in 
the first verse, was a symbol of the power of the Arabs. Its "splitting apart" 
indicated the overthrow of the power of the Quraish. After warning the Holy 
Prophet's opponents, the chapter mentions examples of the people of some 
previous prophets. Towards the end it contains a prophetical reference to the 
battle of Badr. It is undoubtedly an early revelation at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Judgment to overtake Opponents 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 The hour drew near and the moon was split apart." 2 And if 
they see a sign, they turn away and say: Strong enchantment! 
3 And they deny and follow their low desires; and every affair is 
settled/ 4 And certainly narratives have come to them, which 
should deter — Consummate wisdom — but warnings have not 



a (1) The "splitting apart of the moon" in the time of the Holy Prophet is an 
incident related by a number of his companions; and the reports of this incident 
are classed as well-known, and are accepted as correct by Bukhari and Muslim. In 
the whole history of miracles, this is the only miracle of which a contempora- 
neous record exists. It may have been a particular kind of lunar eclipse, the moon 
appearing as if it were split into two, a part remaining bright and the other part 
darkening, or some great commotion might have taken place in the moon or some 
other unusual phenomenon may have occurred, which might have been made 
apparent to the naked eye through the strong visionary power of the Holy Prophet. 
Some commentators are, however, of the opinion that this verse refers to the split- 
ting apart of the moon at the approach of the day of Judgment. 

b (2) By calling it strong enchantment, they meant that it was a strong magi- 
cal illusion, not an actual occurrence. But the word mustamirr, translated here as 
strong, may also mean transient, i.e., a thing which has occurred and passed 
away, or continuous in the sense that such things have been taking place of old. 

c (3) The words may mean that every affair must draw to an end, the 
reference being to the opposition which was being offered to the Prophet.

invites them to a hard task — 7 their eyes cast down, they will go 
forth from their graves as if they were scattered locusts, "hastening 
to the Inviter. The disbelievers will say: This is a hard day! 

9 Before them the people of Noah rejected — they rejected 
Our servant and called (him) mad, and he was driven away. 10 So 
he called upon his Lord: I am overcome, so help (me). n Then We 
opened the gates of heaven with water pouring down, 12 and made 
water to flow forth in the land in springs, so the water gathered 
together according to a measure already ordained. 13 And We bore 
him on (a vessel) made of planks and nails, 14 floating on, before 
Our eyes — a reward for him who was denied. c 15 And certainly 
We left it as a sign, but is there anyone who will be mindful? 
16 How (terrible) was then My punishment and My warning! 17 And 
certainly We have made the Quran easy to remember, but is there 
anyone who will be mindful? 

18 Ad denied; how (terrible) was then My punishment and 
My warning! 19 Surely We sent on them a furious wind in a day of 
bitter ill-luck, 20 tearing people away as if they were trunks of 
uprooted palm-trees. 21 How (terrible) was then My punishment 
and My warning! 22 And certainly We have made the Quran easy 
to remember, but is there anyone who will be mindful? 



a (5) The fate of the ancients, of whom narratives are recited, should have 
prevented the opponents of Truth from following in their footsteps. 

b (8) The commentators make all verses of this kind apply to the life after 
death, but comparison with the fate of other people, whose stories are narrated by 
way of illustration, shows clearly that the punishment of this life is also meant. 
The hard day of trouble overtakes the opponents of Truth in this life as well, and 
the Hereafter only brings it in a more palpable, and therefore more terrible, form. 
The Inviter is the Prophet, who invites them to truth, and the graves as applying to 
this life may signify their homes because they were spiritually dead. 

c (14) The boat in which Noah and his companions were saved, spoken of in 
v. 1 3 as made of ordinary planks and nails, is here described as floating on before 
Our eyes, meaning that it was the mercy of God that saved the boat. 

d (15) The fate of Noah's people is a sign to the deniers of the Holy Prophet. 
Compare 5 1 :37-46, where a sign is said to be left in the people of Noah, in Moses' 
enemies, in Ad and in Thamud. 



54 : 23 • THAMUD AND LOT'S PEOPLE 665 

Section 2: Thamud and Lot's People 

23 Thamud rejected the warning. 24 So they said: What! One 
single mortal from among us! Shall we follow him? We shall then 
be in sure error and distress. 25 Has the reminder been sent to him 
from among us? No, he is an insolent liar! 26 Tomorrow they will 
know who is the liar, the insolent one. 27 Surely We are going to 
send the she-camel as a trial for them; so watch them and have 
patience. 28 And inform them that the water is shared between 
them; (but) every share of the water shall be attended (by the she- 
camel)." 29 But they called their companion, so he took (a sword) 
and hamstrung (her). 30 How (terrible) was then My punishment 
and My warning! 31 Surely We sent upon them a single cry, so they 
were like dry fragments of wood that a fence-maker uses.* 32 And 
certainly We have made the Quran easy to remember, but is there 
anyone who will be mindful? 

33 The people of Lot rejected the warning. 34 Surely We sent 
upon them a stone-storm, c except Lot's followers; We saved them 
a little before daybreak — 35 a favour from Us. Thus do We reward 
him who gives thanks. 36 And certainly he warned them of Our 
violent seizure, but they disputed the warning. 37 And certainly they 
endeavoured to turn him from his guests, but We blinded their 
eyes; so taste My punishment and My warning. 38 And certainly a 
lasting punishment came upon them in the morning. 39 So taste My 
punishment and My warning. 40 And certainly We have made the 
Quran easy to remember, but is there anyone who will be mindful? 



a (28) Water is here said to be shared between them, i.e., between the people 
themselves. "Every share of the water shall be attended" by the she-camel, signi- 
fies that the water shall not be withheld from her on account of its division. 

b (31) The punishment was a severe earthquake which destroyed people and 
their houses. 

c (34) It was a volcanic eruption. Stones mixed with ashes were rained upon 
them. 

d (37) They endeavoured to prevent him taking his guests into his house, but 
were unable to see their way to it.

Section 3: Pharaoh and the Prophet's Opponents 

41 And certainly the warning came to Pharaoh's people. 
42 They rejected all Our signs, so We caught them with the seizing 
of the Mighty, the Powerful. 43 Are your disbelievers better than 
these, or have you (been granted) an immunity in the scriptures? 
44 0r do they say: We are an army allied together to help each 
other? 45 Soon shall the armies be routed, and they will show 
(their) backs." 46 Indeed, the Hour is their promised time, and the 
Hour is most grievous and bitter. 47 Surely the guilty are in error 
and distress. 48 0n the day when they are dragged into the Fire upon 
their faces: Taste the touch of hell. e 49 Surely We have created 
everything according to a measure. 50 And Our command is but 
once, as the twinkling of an eye. 51 And certainly We destroyed 
your fellows, but is there anyone who will be mindful? 

52 And everything they do is in the writings. 53 And every- 
thing small and great is written down. 54 Surely the dutiful will be 
among Gardens and rivers, 55 in the seat of truth, with a most 
Powerful King. 



a (45) It is related that the Holy Prophet prayed within his tent on the day of 
Badr, saying: "O Lord, I beseech You according to Your covenant and Your pro- 
mise; O Lord, if such is Your will (i.e. defeat for the Muslims), You may not be served 
after this day". Abu Bakr took his hand and said: "Allah is sufficient for you, 
O Messenger of Allah". So the Holy Prophet went out and he recited the verses 45- 
46 occurring here (Bukhari, 56:89). This shows how the Holy Prophet and his 
companions read prophecies of the vanquishment of the opponents in words rela- 
ting apparently to the Hereafter. 

b (46) The report referred to in the last footnote shows that the Holy Prophet 
understood the Hour to mean the hour or time of the discomfiture of the Quraish, 
and looked upon the battle of Badr as fulfilling this prophecy. 

c (48) The Quraish who were slain at Badr were removed to a pit for burial, 
and the Holy Prophet is reported as having addressed them thus: "Surely we have 
found true what our Lord promised us: have you too found true what your Lord 
promised you?" The punishment of this life is called here a touch of hell. 

d (49) So that even nations and people cannot go beyond a certain limit. 



Chapter 55 
Ai-Rahman The Beneficent 

This chapter takes it title from the name of God, The Beneficent, with which 
it begins, and the entire chapter speaks of the beneficence of Allah to human 
beings both in material and spiritual terms. It opens with the statement that 
the revelation of the Quran is due to Divine beneficence, and goes on to 
mention the means for man's physical sustenance created due to the same 
beneficence. Then it speaks of the judgment to overtake the guilty who reject 
the spiritual benefits provided for them and the reward of the faithful who 
avail themselves of those benefits. The chapter belongs to the early period at 
Makkah. 



Section 1 : Divine Beneficence 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 The Beneficent — 2 He taught the Quran." 3 He created man, 
4 taught him expression. 5 The sun and the moon follow a reckon- 
ing, 6 and the herbs and the trees adore (Him). 7 And the heaven, 
He raised it high, and He set up the measured 8 that you may not 
exceed the measure. 9 So maintain the balance with justice, nor fall 
short in the measure. 



a (2) Al-Rahman is the Beneficent God Who brought things into existence 
for the sustenance of man before his creation. Man has not earned them. The same 
Beneficent God, we are here told, has taught the Quran, which is a necessity for 
the spiritual life of man. It is a Divine gift for the spiritual sustenance of man, like 
so many gifts for his physical sustenance. 

b (6) Everything created, from those large bodies in the heavens to the 
smallest herbs that grow on land, follows a law. Is not, then, a law needed for the 
spiritual perfection of man? Najm means star as well as herb. 

c (7) The word mizan in the Quran does not signify a pair of scales for 
weighing things, but a measure, as signifying any standard of comparison, esti- 
mation, or judgment, and the term is here, as elsewhere, used in this broad sense. 
See 57:25, where the mizan is that which enables people to be just in their 
actions. See also 42:17 footnote.

a (12) The husk or the outer covering is generally considered to be a worth- 
less thing. In speaking of it as one of the bounties of God it is hinted that even the 
husk can be turned into a useful and valuable thing. In contrast with the husk is 
mentioned the fragrance, which resembles the spirit in the body. Neither should 
the outer form of the Divine law be considered to be a thing of no use, nor should 
the spirit of the law be neglected. 

b (13) This verse is repeated several times in this chapter. In the original the 
dual form is used rather than the plural, and thus what is translated here as your 
Lord is the Lord of you two. The dual form is sometimes used in Arabic to give 
force to the meaning. If the dual is taken literally, the two classes addressed are 
the believers and the disbelievers or the strong and the weak, divisions which are 
of frequent occurrence in the Quran. Believers and disbelievers are specially 
referred to in the concluding words of the last chapter (54:47-55). 

c (15) For the creation of jinn from fire see 7:12, 15:27 and footnotes there, 
where it is contrasted with the creation of man from earth. 

d (17) The two Easts and the two Wests signify the different points of the 
horizon at which the sun rises and sets at the summer and winter solstice. In 
modern terminology, the two Easts are the Near or the Middle East and the Far 
East; the two Wests are Europe and America. 

e (20) The two seas are mentioned in 25:53 and 35:12 as the sweet-water sea 
and the salt-water sea. See footnote on 25:53. In 35:12, as here, it is stated also 
that from both seas fresh flesh and ornaments are obtained; the significance being 
that useful men would continue to arise from among both believers and non- 
believers. Some understand that the Red and the Mediterranean Seas are meant. 
These seas were separated formerly, but are now united by the Suez Canal, and 
the verse is considered to contain a prophetical mention of this union.

red hide. 38 Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you 
deny? 39 So on that day neither man nor jinn will be asked about 
his sin. 40 Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny? 



a (31) The two armies here are the believers and the disbelievers, and 
Allah's applying Himself to them signifies the judging of their case so that each 
should have its reward or punishment. 

b (33) The jinn and the people of this verse are the great and the small oppo- 
nents of the Holy Prophet or the foreigners and the Arabs. (Editor's Note: The 
words "You cannot pass through but with authority" may also be rendered as: 
"You cannot escape from the kingdom (of Allah)". This may be a reference to 
man's flights into space, the meaning being that man cannot escape the laws and 
judgment of God whether on the earth or anywhere beyond it.) 

c (35) This seems to be a reference to the terrible weapons of modern 
warfare. See also 73:17-18.

a (46) The reward of the righteous is spoken of here as two Gardens, i.e., a 
Garden in this life and a Garden in the Hereafter. The Garden of this life is the 
spiritual bliss which the righteous find here in the doing of good, of which gardens 
and rivers and fruits are symbols. There may also be a deeper reference here to the 
worldly conquests which the Muslims were promised. 

b (58) So far as there is a description of the spiritual blessings of the Here- 
after in these words, see 52:20 footnote. So far as it relates to this life, the chaste 
and modest wives of the faithful are meant. 

c (62) The faithful are spoken of in the next chapter as belonging to two 
classes: the ordinary believers, or those on the right hand, and the foremost (56:8, 
10); hence the two Gardens of this verse as compared with the two Gardens of v. 
46; or, by the two Gardens of v. 46, are meant the Gardens of the Hereafter and by 
the two Gardens of this verse are meant the Gardens of this world.

Chapter 56 

Al-Waqi'ah The Evdlt 

The Event referred to in the first verse, from which the title of this chapter is 
taken, is the time of the meting out of reward and punishment to the faithful 
and their opponents respectively. It begins by stating that people will be 
divided into three classes: the foremost among the faithful, the other believers 
and the opponents. Then it speaks of the judgment upon them, the three 
classes each receiving what they deserve. The chapter is an early revelation at 
Makkah. 



Section 1 : Three Classes of People 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 When the Event comes to pass a — 2 there is no denying its 
coming to pass — degrading (some), exalting (others) — 4 when 
the earth is shaken with a (severe) shaking, 5 and the mountains are 
crumbled to pieces, 6 so they are as scattered dust, 7 and you are 
three sorts. 

8 So those on the right hand; how (happy) are those on the 
right hand! 9 And those on the left; how (wretched) are those on 
the left! 10 And the foremost (in doing good) are the foremost (in 
reaping reward) — 11 these are drawn near (to Allah). 12 In Gardens

a (1) The Quran speaks of the Hour or the Event not only as signifying the 
Resurrection, but also very frequently as signifying the doom of its opponents. 
That doom was, in fact, a foretaste of what they would suffer in the life after 
death; this is made clear in v. 3. 

b (5) The crumbling of the mountains signifies the fall of great opponents; 
see 20:105 footnote. 

c (14) Those who accepted the Holy Prophet in the earlier stages of his 
mission, and had to make greater sacrifices, had a greater reward; but there were 
others who waited until Islam was established in the land and made no sacrifices.

on them, facing each other. 17 Round about them will go youths 
never altering in age," 18 with goblets and ewers, and a cup of pure 
drink — 19 they are not affected with headache by it, nor are they 
intoxicated, 20 and fruits that they choose, 21 and flesh of fowl that 
they desire, 22 and pure, beautiful ones, 23 like hidden pearls. 
24 A reward for what they did. 25 They hear therein no idle or sinful 
talk — 26 but only the saying, Peace! Peace! 

27 And those on the right hand; how (happy) are those on the 
right hand! 28 Amid thornless lote trees, 29 and clustered banana 
trees, 30 and extensive shade, 31 and water gushing, 32 and abundant 
fruit, 33 neither failing, nor forbidden, 34 and exalted couches. 
35 Surely We have created them as a (new) creation, 36 so We have 
made them virgins, 37 loving, equals in age/ 38 for those on the 
right hand. 39 A multitude from among the first, 40 and a multitude 
from among those of later times. 6

41 And those on the left hand; how (wretched) are those on 
the left hand! 42 In hot wind and boiling water, 43 and shadow of 
black smoke, 44 neither cool nor refreshing. 45 Surely they lived 
before that in ease. 46 And they persisted in the great violation.^ 



a (17) Because there is no decay in the life after death. 

b (26) After various blessings are enumerated, their true nature is depicted in 
one word, Peace. Peace in this world, and Peace in the Hereafter, such is the 
message of Islam. 

c (35) These words show that the blessings of the next life, whether shades 
or trees or water or fruits, are all the fruits of deeds which have been created as a 
new creation. 

d (37) As shown in 52:20 footnote, words primarily applicable to women are 
used to describe some blessings of the next life because womanhood stands as a 
symbol of purity and beauty. "Equals in age", as already shown in 38:52 footnote, 
signifies that the growth of those blessings begins with the growth of spiritual life 
in a person. 

e (40) These verses do not contradict verses 13 and 14, as the earlier verses 
speak only of those who were foremost in accepting the Holy Prophet.

47 And they used to say: When we die and become dust and bones, 
shall we then indeed be raised, 48 or our forefathers? 49 Say: The 
ancients and those of later times 50 will surely be gathered together 
for the appointed hour of a known day. 51 Then shall you, O you 
who are in error and deny, 52 eat from the tree of Zaqqum, 53 and 
fill (your) bellies with it; 54 then drink after it boiling water; 55 and 
drink as drinks the thirsty camel. 56 This is their entertainment on 
the day of Recompense. 

57 We have created you, why do you not then accept? 58 Do 
you see (the semen) which you emit? 59 Is it you that create it or 
are We the Creator? 60 We have ordained death among you and We 
are not to be overcome, 61 that We may change your state and make 
you grow into what you do not know. a 62 And certainly you know 
the first growth, why do you not then be mindful? 

63 Do you see what you sow? 64 Is it you that cause it to grow, 
or are We the Causer of growth? 65 If We pleased, We would make 
it chaff, then would you lament: 66 Surely we are burdened with 
debt, 67 indeed, we are deprived. 68 Do you see the water which you 
drink? 69 Do you bring it down from the clouds, or are We the 
Bringer? 70 If We pleased, We could make it saltish; why do you 
not then give thanks? 71 Do you see the fire which you kindle? 
72 Is it you that produce the trees for it, or are We the Producer? 
73 We have made it a reminder and an advantage for the travellers 
of the desert.' 74 So glorify the name of jour Lord, the Incomparably 
Great. 

Section 3: Judgment is Inevitable 

75 But indeed, I swear by revelation of portions (of the 
Quran)! e — 76 and it is a great oath indeed, if you knew — 



a (61) In the next life, the present state will be changed, and people will be 
made to grow into a new creation, which they do not know. It is not the material 
body of this life, but a new body which grows out of the deeds of a person. 

b (73) The fire burned at night points out to the desert traveller a habitation 
of people, where he will be welcome. 

c (75) The meaning adopted suits the context. See 53:1 footnote, where it is

77 surely it is a bountiful Quran, 78 in a book that is protected, 
79 which none touches but the purified ones. a 80 A revelation from 
the Lord of the worlds. 81 Is it this announcement that you disdain? 
82 And make your denial your means of subsistence.* 83 Then why 
not, when (the soul) comes up to the throat, 84 and you at that time 
look on — 85 and We are nearer to it than you, but you do not see 
— 86 then why do you not, if you are not held under authority, 
87 send it back, if you are truthful? c 

88 So if he is one of those drawn near (to Allah), 89 then (he 
has) happiness and bounty and a Garden of bliss. 90 And if he is 
one of those on the right hand, 91 then peace to you from those on 
the right hand. 92 But if he is one of the rejectors, the ones in error, 
93 he has an entertainment of boiling water, 94 and burning in hell. 
95 Surely this is a certain truth. 96 So glorify the name of your Lord, 
the Incomparably Great. 

shown that the word najm meaning star, used here as the plural nujum, means also 
a portion of the Quran. The significance of the oath is that every portion of the 
Quran bears evidence to its own truth. 

a (79) The Quran is called karim (bounteous or bountiful) on account of the 
benefit which it brought to humanity. V. 78 speaks of it as being protected, by 
which is meant not only that it will be protected against all attempts to destroy it, 
but also that it will be protected in all its purity in writing. V. 79 states that it can 
be touched only by those purified by God. This shows that an understanding of 
the Quran is granted only to those who are pure in heart. It also shows that the 
Quran should not be touched by one who is impure. Hence the companions were 
forbidden to carry the Quran to an enemy's country (Bukhari, 56:129). This 
further shows that the Quran existed in a written form, as a book, from the first. 

b (82) The meaning is that you are bent upon giving the lie to the Quran to 
such an extent as if to give it the lie were your means of subsistence, without 
which you could not live. 

c (87) The meaning is that if you are your own masters, and not subject to 
the authority of a Higher Power, why can you not resist death when it comes to 
you? 



Chapter 57 

Al-Hadld IrOIl 

In reference to the punishment of the opponents who were bent on extirpating 
Islam with the sword, this chapter is entitled Iron, from the word occurring in 
v. 25. It opens with a prophecy of the future conquests of Islam, for which 
Muslims will have to make sacrifices. Then it speaks of the hypocrites and 
prophesies that, due to the passage of a long time, the hearts of the believers 
will harden but again they will receive spiritual life after that. It goes on to 
say that worldly enjoyments are temporary and one should strive for perma- 
nent good. The chapter ends with a promise of two kinds of Divine grace 
which were in store for the believers. Chapters 57-66 constitute the last 
group of chapters in the Quranic arrangement that were revealed at Madinah. 
Chapters 57-60, 65 and 66 were revealed in the period 4 A.H. to 7 A.H. 



Section 1 : Establishment of the Kingdom of God 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Whatever is in the heavens and the earth declares the glory 
of Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise. 2 His is the kingdom of 
the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death, and He 
is Powerful over all things. 3 He is the First and the Last and the 
Manifest and the Hidden, and He is Knower of all things. a 

4 He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six 
periods, and He is established on the Throne of Power. He knows 
what goes down into the earth and what comes forth out of it, and 
what comes down from heaven and what goes up to it. And He is 
with you wherever you are. And Allah is Seer of what you do. 



a (3) The Holy Prophet has explained the four attributes of the Divine Being 
mentioned here as follows. He is the First, so that there was nothing before Him, 
He is the Last, so that there is nothing after Him, He is the Manifest, or the 
Ascendant over all, so that there is nothing above Him, and He is the Hidden, the 
Knower of the hidden things, so that there is nothing hidden from Him (Sahih 
Muslim, 48:13).

57:5« ESTABLISHMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD 677 

5 His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and to Allah are 
(all) affairs returned. 6 He makes the night to pass into the day, and 
makes the day to pass into the night. And He is Knower of what is 
in the hearts. 

7 Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and spend (on good 
works) out of that in which He has made you heirs. So those of 
you who believe and spend — for them is a great reward. 8 And 
what reason have you that you do not believe in Allah? And the 
Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord, and He has indeed 
accepted your covenant, if you are believers." 9 He it is Who sends 
down clear messages to His servant, that he may bring you forth 
from darkness into light. And surely Allah is Kind, Merciful to you. 
10 And what reason have you that you do not spend in Allah's 
way? And Allah's is the inheritance of the heavens and the earth. 
Those of you who spent before the Victory and fought are not on a 
level (with others).* They are greater in rank than those who spent 
and fought afterwards. But Allah has promised good to all. And 
Allah is Aware of what you do. 

Section 2: Light and Life given by the Prophet 

11 Who is it that will offer to Allah a goodly gift, so He will 
double it for him, and he will have a generous reward. 12 On that 
day you will see the believers, men and women, their light gleam- 
ing before them and on their right hand. c Good news for you this 
day! — Gardens in which rivers flow, to abide in them! That is the 
mighty achievement. 

13 On the day when the hypocrites, men and women, will say 
to those who believe: Wait for us, that we may borrow from 



a (8) The believers, who are addressed, are exhorted to be true to their belief. 
Belief is thus not mere confession of the Truth but the upholding of it under trials. 

b (10) By Victory here is meant the moral victory gained by the Hudaibiyah 
truce, or the conquest of Makkah, which made Muslims virtually the masters of 
the whole of Arabia. The sacrifices made earlier had therefore a greater value on 
account of the trials which Muslims had then to face. 

c (12) The light of faith, which was given through the Prophet, will become 
manifest on the day of Resurrection. 



678 57. IRON • 57 : 14 

your light. It will be said: Turn back and seek a light. Then a wall, 
with a door in it, will be raised between them. Within it shall be 
mercy, and outside of it punishment. 14 They will cry out to them: 
Were we not with you? They will say: Indeed, but you caused 
yourselves to fall into temptation, and you waited and doubted,* 
and vain desires deceived you, till the threatened punishment of 
Allah came, and the arch-deceiver deceived you about Allah. 
15 So this day no ransom will be accepted from you, nor from those 
who disbelieved. Your abode is the Fire; it is your patron and evil 
is the destination^ 

16 Has not the time yet come for the believers that their hearts 
should be humble for the remembrance of Allah and the Truth that 
is revealed, and (that) they should not be like those who were 
given the Book before, but time was prolonged for them, so their 
hearts hardened. d And most of them are transgressors. 17 Know that 
Allah gives life to the earth after its death. 6 Indeed, We have 



a (13) Although the hypocrites remained mixed with the believers for a time, 
yet separation was brought about even in this life towards the close of the Holy 
Prophet's life. As the Resurrection will bring hidden things to light, the hypocrites 
will find themselves devoid of light, because they did not possess the light of faith 
in this life. 

b (14) The hypocrites hoped that the Muslims would be annihilated by their 
powerful opponents. 

c (15) The Fire is here called a mania, or a friend or patron, of the disbelie- 
vers, thus showing that it is for their good that they will have to undergo the 
suffering of fire. Hell is elsewhere also represented to be a place or a state which 
will ultimately lead to the purification of man, as fire purifies gold of dross. The 
process of purification, which is in other words hell, is thus a necessary stage in 
the spiritual perfection of those who do not avail themselves of the opportunity 
granted to them in this life. 

d (16) This verse speaks of Muslims of a later age, for it compares their case 
to those who were given the scriptures before them and then a long time having 
passed over them, their hearts hardened. They are reminded that after the passing 
of a long time, they will fall off from the high standard of the earlier generations, 
and their hearts will be hardened like the hearts of the earlier people. 

e (18) Having spoken of the falling off of the Muslims of a later age, the 
good news is here announced that, after that, the dead earth will be generated with 
a new life, the life spiritual. The next verse then goes on to add that it will be 



57 : 18 • TRUTH SHALL BE ESTABLISHED 679 



made the signs clear for you that you may understand. 

18 The men who give in charity and the women who give in 
charity and set apart for Allah a goodly portion, it will be doubled 
for them, and theirs is a generous reward. 19 And those who believe 
in Allah and His messengers, they are the truthful and the faithful 
ones with their Lord. They have their reward and their light. And 
those who disbelieve and reject Our messages, they are the inmates 
of hell. 

Section 3: Truth shall be established 

20 Know that this world's life is only an idle sport and play 
and an attraction and boasting among yourselves and a race in the 
multiplication of wealth and children. It is as rain, whose causing 
the vegetation to grow pleases the tillers, then it withers away so 
that you see it turning yellow, then it becomes chaff. And in the 
Hereafter is a severe punishment, and (also) forgiveness from Allah 
and (His) pleasured And this world's life is nothing but a source 
of vanity. 

21 Vie with one another for forgiveness from your Lord and a 
Garden as vast as the vastness of the heaven and the earth — it is 



through the sacrifices of a part of them that the Muslim nation will again be raised 
to eminence. 

a (20-1) This world's life here means the material side of life. It is entirely a 
pursuit of unreality. Individuals as well as nations are, as it were, racing for the 
transitory goods of this life, for means of adorning the outside, for riches and 
gaiety, utterly neglecting the higher values of life which are pointed out in v. 2 1 . 

b (20-2) The material side of life is here likened to the growth of vegetation 
which flourishes for a time and then decays. Even thus we see individuals and 
nations rising to prosperity and then falling back on evil days. 

c (20-3) Note how Divine forgiveness is constantly mentioned when punish- 
ment is spoken of, to show that the attribute of mercy is the predominant attribute 
of the Divine nature. 

d (21) The Garden or the Paradise is here said to be as extensive as the 
heavens and the earth, and a similar statement occurs in 3:133. It shows clearly 
that heaven and hell are not the names of two places, but are really two condi- 
tions, because if paradise were the name of a particular place, hell could not exist, 
as paradise would according to these verses extend over the whole of space. 



680 57. IRON • 57 : 22 

prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. That 
is the grace of Allah; He gives it to whom He pleases. And Allah 
is the Lord of mighty grace. 22 No disaster befalls in the earth, or in 
yourselves, but it is in a book before We bring it into existence a 
— surely that is easy to Allah — 23 so that you may not grieve for 
what has escaped you, nor exult in what He has given you. And 
Allah does not love any arrogant boaster, 24 such as are miserly and 
enjoin miserliness on people. And whoever turns back, then surely 
Allah is the Self-Sufficient, the Praised. 

25 Certainly We sent Our messengers with clear arguments, 
and sent down with them the Book and the measure, that people 
may conduct themselves with equity. 6 And We sent down iron, in 
which is great violence and advantages for people/ and that Allah 
may know who helps Him and His messengers, unseen. Surely 
Allah is Strong, Mighty. 



a (22) The book here means Divine knowledge. Disaster is here spoken of as 
befalling in the earth or in yourselves, i.e., it either affects the people of the world 
generally or the Muslims in particular. In view of v. 16, relating to the lapse of a 
long time and the hardening of the hearts of the Muslims, it is easy to see that the 
disasters which are predicted as befalling the Muslims in the latter days are due to 
their own falling off from the high standard of life which they were required to 
follow, and hence the remedy suggested is again the making of sacrifices as poin- 
ted out in v. 18. 

b (25-1) See 42:17 footnote and 55:7 footnote. Here the measure is spoken 
of as being sent down with messengers of God along with the Book. Now the 
Book contains the Divine commandments or the moral code of life, and the 
measure is therefore clearly the example of the Prophet, who by carrying out the 
Divine commandments shows how the directions contained in the Book are to be 
followed. 

c (25-2) Iron has proved of great utility to man and has played an all- 
important part in civilization. It should be noted that the sending down of a thing 
also means causing it to grow or bringing the means of it into existence. Hence we 
find this expression used in the Quran with reference to the clothes that man 
wears (7:26), and to cattle (39:6), etc. The mention of iron undoubtedly refers to 
the resistance against the enemy, which as a last resort had to be effected with the 
sword — that Allah may know who helps Him and His messengers, unseen. This 
help was rendered by the faithful by taking up the sword in defence of the faith. 



57 : 26 • DOUBLE REWARD FOR BELIEVERS 681 

Section 4: Double Reward for Believers 

26 And certainly We sent Noah and Abraham, and We gave 
prophethood and the Book to their offspring; so some of them go 
aright, but most of them are transgressors. 27 Then We made Our 
messengers to follow in their footsteps, and We made Jesus son of 
Mary to follow, and We gave him the Gospel. And We put com- 
passion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. And 
(as for) monkery, they innovated it — We did not prescribe it to 
them — only to seek Allah's pleasure, but they did not observe it 
with its due observance." So We gave those of them who believed 
their reward, but most of them are transgressors. 

28 O you who believe, keep your duty to Allah and believe in 
His Messenger — He will give you two portions of His mercy,* 
and give you a light in which you shall walk, and forgive you. 
And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful — 29 that the People of the Book 
may know that they control nothing of the grace of Allah, and that 
grace is in Allah's hand. He gives it to whom He pleases. And 
Allah is the Lord of mighty grace. c 



a (27) Muslims were now becoming a great nation, and as they were brought 
up in the utmost simplicity, and were also enjoined to disdain the gaiety of this 
life, they are told that while retaining their simplicity of life they should not stoop 
to practices like that of monkery. They are thus required to keep the balance 
between the material and moral sides of life. Christians innovated monkery but 
failed to attain the object for which they adopted it. 

b (28) By the two portions of mercy are meant their portion in this world and 
their portion in the Hereafter. A Muslim is thus required to enjoy the worldly 
benefits but not to the neglect of his moral responsibilities. Christian civilization 
started with monkery and has ended in engrossment in the world to the utter 
neglect of the spiritual side. The history of Islam on the other hand shows tem- 
poral and spiritual advancement going hand in hand. The only lasting civilization 
is one which offers a middle course, and chalks out a way, by walking in which 
man can attain material along with spiritual advancement. Hence the next verse 
speaks clearly of the People of the Book. 

c (29) The People of the Book or the Christians are here told that they do not 
control Allah's grace. They wanted first to control His spiritual grace by monkery, 
but failed. Later, they have tried to control His material grace and bounties by 
their entire engrossment in worldly pursuits, but even their material advancement 
is leading to their ruin, because it is not being balanced by spiritual progress. 



Chapter 58 
Ai-Mujadiiah The Pleading Woman 

The title of this chapter is taken from the event narrated at its opening which 
mentions a woman pleading a complaint about her husband before the Holy 
Prophet. The husband had, in accordance with an old Arab custom, put her 
away by calling her as his "mother", which placed the wife in a state where 
she neither had marital rights nor was divorced. The chapter begins by aboli- 
shing this custom. Then it condemns secret counsels, allowing them only for 
purposes of discussing good works. It ends by cautioning Muslims not to have 
friendship with those who opposed and conspired against Islam. This chapter 
was revealed in about 4 A.H.

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.

about her husband and complains to Allah; and Allah hears the 
contentions of both of you." Surely Allah is Hearing, Seeing. 
2 Those of you who put away their wives by calling them their

except those who gave them birth, and they utter indeed a hateful

Samit, who was separated by her husband in an old Arab form, the husband say- 
ing to the wife, You are to me as the back of my mother. See also 33:4 footnote, 
for this practice of zihar, and its abolition by Islam. The woman complained about 
it to the Holy Prophet, who said that, as he had no revelation about it, he could not 
interfere. Then Aus wanted her to have conjugal relations with him, but she 
refused and came to the Prophet complaining of his bad temper. The Prophet 
wanted her to be more lenient but she was not willing. It was then that the Prophet 
received this revelation, according to which it was necessary that the husband 
should in such cases make an expiation before re-establishing conjugal rights.

touch one another. To this you are exhorted; and Allah is Aware 
of what you do. 4 But he who does not have the means should fast 
for two months successively before they touch one another, and he 
who is unable to do so should feed sixty needy ones. That is in 
order that you may have faith in Allah and His Messenger. And 
these are Allah's limits. And for the disbelievers is a painful 
punishment. 

5 Surely those who oppose Allah and His Messenger will be 
humbled as those before them were humbled," and indeed We 
have revealed clear messages. And for the disbelievers is a 
humiliating punishment. 6 On the day when Allah will raise them 
all together, then inform them of what they did. Allah records it, 
while they forget it. And Allah is Witness over all things. 

Section 2: Secret Counsels condemned 

7 Do you not see that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens 
and whatever is in the earth? There is no secret counsel between 
three but He is the fourth of them, nor between five but He is the 
sixth of them, nor between less than that nor more but He is with 
them wherever they are; then He will inform them of what they 
did on the day of Resurrection. Surely Allah is Knower of all 
things.* 

8 Do you not see those who are forbidden secret counsels, then 
they return to what they are forbidden, and hold secret counsels 
for sin and revolt and disobedience to the Messenger. And when 
they come to you they greet you with a greeting with which Allah 



a (5) Those who would not abide by the Divine commandments regarding 
the treatment of women are here told that this was not a light matter. They were in 
the ranks of those who opposed the Prophet. 

b (7) The hypocrites and the Jews conspired with the enemies of Islam to 
destroy the Muslim community of Madinah. There is a brief reference to their 
plots in 4:114: "There is no good in most of their secret counsels". Such plots are 
mentioned in greater detail here, and they are told that these secret plots are 
known to Allah, and they cannot succeed in bringing harm to Islam.

does not greet you," and say within themselves: Why does not 
Allah punish us for what we say? Hell is enough for them, they 
will burn in it, and evil is the destination! 

9 O you who believe, when you confer together in private, do 
not give to each other counsel of sin and revolt and disobedience 
to the Messenger, but give to each other counsel of goodness and 
observance of duty. And keep your duty to Allah, to Whom you 
will be gathered together. 10 Secret counsels are only of the devil 
that he may cause to grieve those who believe, and he cannot hurt 
them at all except with Allah's permission. And on Allah let the 
believers rely. e 

110 you who believe, when it is said to you, Make room in 
assemblies, make room. Allah will give you ample (room). And 
when it is said, Rise up, rise up. Allah will exalt those of you who 
believe, and those who are given knowledge, to high ranks. And 
Allah is Aware of what you do. 

12 O you who believe, when you consult the Messenger, offer 
something in charity before your consultation. That is better for 
you and purer. But if you do not have (the means), then surely 
Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 13 Do you fear that you will not (be 
able to) give in charity before your consultation? So when you do 
not do it, and Allah has turned to you (mercifully), keep up prayer 
and give the due (obligatory) charity and obey Allah and His 
Messenger. And Allah is Aware of what you do. 



a (8) The meaning is that they invoke death and destruction for you (i.e. for 
the Prophet), while Allah wishes that you should live and prosper. 

b (9) Secret counsels and secret societies are condemned, but private counsels 
to promote the cause of goodness and service of humanity are quite different from 
the subversive activities of secret societies. 

c (10) Secret societies denounced in the above verses would not be able to 
achieve their mischievous object against Islam. 

rf(ll) The progress of Islam brought large numbers of people into its fold 
who stood in need of being taught manners as well as morals. In their assemblies 
they crowded and pressed upon each other in order to be able to sit nearest to the 
Prophet. The injunction to make room in assemblies means, either that room 
should be made for others, or that the people should not sit too close to each other.

take shelter under their oaths, so they turn (people) from Allah's 
way; for them is a humiliating punishment. 17 Of no avail against 
Allah, will be to them their wealth or their children. They are the 
companions of the Fire; in it they will abide. 18 On the day when 
Allah will raise them all up, they will swear to Him as they swear 
to you, and they think that they have some (excuse). Now surely 
they are the liars. 19 The devil has gained mastery over them, so he 
has made them forget the remembrance of Allah. They are the 
devil's party. Now surely the devil's party are the losers. 

20 Those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, they shall be 
among the most degraded. 21 Allah has written down: I shall 
certainly prevail, I and My messengers. Surely Allah is Strong, 
Mighty." 22 7ou will not find a people who believe in Allah and 
the Last Day loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, 
even though they be their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, 
or their kinsfolk. c These are they into whose hearts He has 
impressed faith, and strengthened them with a Spirit from Him- 
self, and He will make them enter Gardens in which rivers flow, 
abiding in them. Allah is well-pleased with them and they are 
well-pleased with Him. These are Allah's party. Now surely it is 
Allah's party who are the successful! 



a (21) Note the certain conviction of the final triumph of Truth, which is 
expressed here. The next verse concludes with similar words: Surely it is Allah's 
party who are the successful. 

b (22-1) The Muslims are the people who believe in Allah and the Last Day. 

c (22-2) In a state of war between the two parties, friendly relations with the 
hostile tribes were prohibited, and these would have resulted in great harm to the 
weaker community of the Muslims. As to those who were not actually engaged in 
hostilities against the Muslims, see the express directions contained in 60:8. 



Chapter 59 
Ai-Hashr The Banishment 

This chapter deals with the banishment of a Jewish tribe, called Bani Nadir, 
from Madinah. They had made a treaty with the Holy Prophet to remain 
neutral between him and his enemies from Makkah, but later broke this treaty 
and made an alliance with them. The chapter deals with their banishment and 
shows that the hypocrites, after giving them promises of help, failed to fulfil 
them. It ends with a beautiful exposition of some of the attributes of God. 
This chapter was revealed in 4 A.H. 



Section 1 : The Exiled Jews 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth 
glorifies Allah; and He is the Mighty, the Wise. 2 He it is Who 
caused those who disbelieved from among the People of the Book 
to go forth from their homes at the first banishment. You did not 
think that they would go forth, while they thought that their 
fortresses would defend them against Allah. But Allah came to 
them from a place they did not expect and cast terror into their 
hearts — they demolished their houses with their own hands and 
the hands of the believers. So take a lesson, O you who have 
eyes! 



a (2) The Bani Nadir made a treaty with the Holy Prophet to stand neutral 
between him and his enemies. When he was victorious at Badr, they said that he 
was the Prophet promised in the Torah, but when the Muslims suffered a loss at 
Uhud, they repudiated their vow, broke the agreement and tried to make an 
alliance with the Makkans. The Holy Prophet told the tribe to leave Madinah. 
They wanted ten days for preparation, but Abdullah ibn Ubayy (the head of the 
hypocrites) advised them not to leave Madinah but to fight against the Prophet, 
promising the help of his own men. So they fortified themselves within their 
strongholds. After having remained besieged for twenty-one days, and having 
despaired of help from the hypocrites, they surrendered. The Prophet raised the 
siege on condition that they should depart from Madinah. With the exception of 
two families that chose to remain at Khaibar, they all went to Syria. The Bani

59:3« THE EXILED JEWS 687 

3 And if Allah had not decreed for them the exile, He would 
certainly have punished them in this world; and for them in the 
Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire. 4 That is because they were 
opposed to Allah and His Messenger, and whoever is opposed to 
Allah, surely Allah is Severe in retribution. 5 Whatever palm-tree 
you cut down or leave it standing upon its roots, it is by Allah's 
permission, and that He may disgrace the transgressors. 

6 And whatever Allah restored to His Messenger from them, 
you did not press forward against it any horse or any riding-camel, 
but Allah gives authority to His messengers against whom He 
pleases. And Allah is Powerful over all things. 7 Whatever Allah 
restored to His Messenger from the people of the towns, it is for 
Allah and for the Messenger, and for the near of kin and the 
orphans and the needy and the traveller, so that it is not taken by 
turns by the rich among you." And whatever the Messenger gives 
you, accept it, and whatever he forbids you, abstain (from it); and 
keep your duty to Allah. Surely Allah is Severe in retribution. 8 (It 
is) for the poor who fled, who were driven from their homes and 
their possessions, seeking grace of Allah and (His) pleasure, and 
helping Allah and His Messenger. These it is that are the truthful. 

9 And those who made their abode in the City (of Madinah) 
and in faith before them love those who have fled to them, and 
find in their hearts no need of what they are given, and prefer 
(them) before themselves, though poverty may afflict them. And 

Nadir, being granted ten days in which to collect and take with them such of their 
property as they desired, devoted the time at their disposal to the destruction of 
their houses, lest they should be a source of strength to the Muslims. What remained 
of them was demolished by the Muslims. 

a (7) This verse relates to property acquired in war without fighting, while 
8:41 deals with property acquired through fighting. The whole of the property 
mentioned here was to be distributed in exactly the same manner as the one-fifth 
of the kind of acquisitions spoken of in 8:41, i.e. for the benefit of the Muslims in 
general; see footnote under 8:41. The Prophet's share out of this ("for Allah and 
for the Messenger") was considered part of the public treasury. 

b (8) It was only the poor among the refugees, who had lost all their wealth 
and homes and were still so poor that they could not carry on any business of their 
own, who received something from what the Bani Nadir left. 



688 59. THE BANISHMENT • 59 : 10 

whoever is saved from the greediness of his soul, these it is that 
are the successful. a 10 And those who come after them say: Our 
Lord, forgive us and our brethren who preceded us in faith, and 
leave no spite in our hearts towards those who believe. Our Lord, 
surely You are Kind, Merciful. 

Section 2: Hypocrites fail in Promise to the Jews 

11 Have you not seen the hypocrites? They say to their 
brethren who disbelieve from among the People of the Book: If 
you are expelled, we certainly will go forth with you, and we will 
never obey anyone concerning you; and if you are fought against, 
we will certainly help you. And Allah bears witness that they 
surely are liars. e 12 If they are expelled, they will not go forth with 
them, and if they are fought against, they will not help them; and 
even if they help them, they will certainly turn (their) backs; then 
they shall not be helped. 13 Your fear in their hearts is indeed 
greater than Allah's. That is because they are a people who do not 
understand. 

14 They will not fight against you unitedly except in fortified 
towns or from behind walls. Their fighting between them is severe. 
Fou would think them united, but their hearts are divided. That is 



a (9) By those who made their abode in the City and in faith are meant the 
Ansar or the Helpers, i.e., the Muslim residents of Madinah. The meaning is that 
they made an abode in the city of the Prophet and the faith; the faith being likened 
to a place of abode. Before them signifies before their (i.e., the MuhajirTn or Emi- 
grants) coming to Madinah. When the Muslims emigrated from Makkah, the 
Helpers received them as if they were their brothers, lodging them in their own 
houses, and many of them were still living in the houses of their benefactors, 
when the banishment of the Bani Nadir took place. The Helpers were willing that 
the refugees alone should have a share, and, despite that, they might continue to 
lodge in their houses. 

b (10) This verse contains two directions for all future Muslim generations, 
namely, to pray for the forgiveness of earlier generations that have passed away 
before them and to pray for their hearts to be free from all spite towards their 
living Muslim brethren. 

c (11) The hypocrites deceived the Jews with false promises, and thus 
encouraged them to fight against the Prophet. 



59:15' AN EXHORTATION 689 

because they are a people who have no sense. 15 Like those before 
them shortly, they tasted the evil consequences of their conduct, 
and for them is a painful punishment. i fi Like the devil when he 
says to man: Disbelieve. But when he disbelieves, he says: I am 
free of you, surely I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds. 17 So the 
end of both of them is that they are both in the Fire, to abide in it. 
And that is the reward of the wrongdoers. 

Section 3: An Exhortation 

18 O you who believe, keep your duty to Allah, and let every 
soul consider what it sends ahead for tomorrow, and keep your 
duty to Allah. Surely Allah is Aware of what you do. 19 And do not 
be like those who forget Allah, so He makes them forget their own 
souls. These are the transgressors. 20 Not alike are the companions 
of the Fire and the owners of the Garden. The owners of the 
Garden are the achievers. 

21 If We had sent down this Quran on a mountain, you would 
certainly have seen it falling down, splitting apart because of the 
fear of Allah. And We set forth these parables to people that they 
may reflect. 

22 He is Allah besides Whom there is no God: the Knower of 
the unseen and the seen; He is the Beneficent, the Merciful. a 23 He 
is Allah, besides Whom there is no God: the King, the Holy, the 
Author of Peace, the Granter of Security, Guardian over all, the 
Mighty, the Supreme, the Possessor of greatness. Glory be to 
Allah from what they set up as partners (with Him)! 24 He is Allah, 
the Creator, the Maker, the Fashioner: His are the most beautiful 
names. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth declares His 
glory; and He is the Mighty, the Wise. 



a (22) From this verse to the end we have a most beautiful collection of the 
Divine names. 



Chapter 60 

Al-Mumtahanah 

The Woman Tested 



This chapter is so named because of the command in v. 10 to test those women 
of the idolaters who came to the Muslims for the purpose of embracing Islam, 
to see if they were sincere in their motives, and in that case to offer them 
refuge. It opens with an instruction to Muslims not to have loving relations 
with those enemies who had driven them out from their homes and were bent 
on destroying them. It goes on to add that friendly relations can be had with 
those who do not fight against the Muslims or expel them from their homes. 
This chapter was very likely revealed in 7 A.H. 



Section 1 : Friendly Relations with Enemies 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O you who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy 
for friends. Would you offer them love, while they deny the Truth 
that has come to you, driving out the Messenger and yourselves 
because you believe in Allah, your Lord?" If you have come forth 
to strive in My way and to seek My pleasure, would you love 
them in secret? And I know what you conceal and what you 
manifest. And whoever of you does this, he indeed strays from the 
straight path. 

2 If they overcome you, they will be your enemies, and will 
stretch forth their hands and their tongues towards you with evil, 
and they desire that you may disbelieve. 3 Your relationships and 
your children would not benefit you, on the day of Resurrection 
— He will decide between you. And Allah is Seer of what you do. 



a (1) Note that the reason given for not taking the disbelievers as friends is 
that they are the enemies of Allah and His Messenger, who drove out the Prophet 
and the Muslims from their homes. Verses 8-9 give a full explanation. 

b (2) That is, they would kill you with their hands and revile you with their 
tongues.

60 : 4 • FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH NON-MUSLIMS 691 

4 Indeed, there is for you a good example in Abraham and 
those with him, when they said to their people: We are clear of 
you and of what you serve besides Allah. We disbelieve in you 
and there has arisen enmity and hatred between us and you forever 
until you believe in Allah alone — except Abraham's saying to 
his sire: I would ask forgiveness for you, and I control nothing at 
all for you from Allah." Our Lord, on You do we rely, and to You 
do we turn, and to You is the eventual coming. 5 Our Lord, do not 
make us a (means of) trial for those who disbelieve, and forgive 
us, our Lord. Surely You are the Mighty, the Wise. 'Certainly there 
is for you in them a good example, for him who hopes for Allah 
and the Last Day. And whoever turns away, surely Allah is the 
Self-Sufficient, the Praised. 

Section 2: Friendly Relations with Non-Muslims 

7 It may be that Allah will bring about friendship between 
you and those of them whom you hold as enemies. And Allah is 
Powerful; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

8 Allah does not forbid you, with regard to those who do not 
fight you for religion, nor drive you forth from your homes, that 
you show them kindness and deal with them justly. Surely Allah 
loves the doers of justice. c 9 Allah forbids you only with regard to 



a (4) This sire was not Abraham's father; see also 6:74, 9:114 and 19:47. 
Abraham's example is quoted to show how loving and tender he was towards his 
people, yet, when it became clear to him that they were bent upon uprooting the 
Truth, even Abraham could not maintain relations of friendship with them. The 
Holy Prophet and his companions were in like manner now obliged to renounce all 
relationships of friendship with a people who were not only the avowed enemies 
of the Muslims but also in a state of continual war with them. 

b (7) This verse makes it clear that the prohibition against friendly relations 
with the disbelievers was only temporary, to be operative only so long as the war 
continued. The friendship prophetically referred to here was brought about after the 
conquest of Makkah. 

c (8) This verse and the next, revealed at a time when the relations between 
Muslims and the disbelievers were most strained on account of a continual state 
of war between the two parties, settle conclusively that friendly relations between 
Muslims and non-Muslims, as such, are not prohibited. It is in the light of these 
verses that all the verses forbidding friendly relations with the disbelievers should

those who fight you for religion, and drive you forth from your 
homes and help (others) in your expulsion, that you make friends 
of them; and whoever makes friends of them, these are the wrong- 
doers. 

10 O you who believe, when believing women come to you 
fleeing, test them. Allah knows best their faith. Then if you know 
them to be believers, do not send them back to the disbelievers. 
Neither are these women lawful for them, nor are those men 
lawful for them. And give those men what they have spent (as 
dowries on these women); and there is no blame on you in marry- 
ing them, when you give them their dowries. And do not hold to 
the ties of marriage of disbelieving women, and ask for what you 
have spent, and let the disbelievers ask for what they have spent. 
That is Allah's judgment; He judges between you.* And Allah is 
Knowing, Wise. n And if any part (of the dowries) of your wives 
has passed away from you to the disbelievers, then your turn 
comes, give to those whose wives have gone away the like of 
what they have spent, and keep your duty to Allah in Whom you

be read, because here the true principle is revealed in unmistakable language, 
allowing friendly relations with one class of disbelievers and prohibiting such 
relations with those of another class. 

a (10-1) People continued to embrace Islam at Makkah, although there was 
now no preacher of the faith there. Bitter persecution often compelled them to flee 
from their homes. This verse relates to believing women who fled to Madinah 
under these circumstances. These women were not taken unconditionally; it was 
necessary that they should be tested. In accordance with this verse, the Holy 
Prophet obtained the assurance of such women under oath that they had not left 
their homes except on account of Islam, and for no other motive. 

b (10-2) The state of permanent warfare between the Muslims and the 
disbelievers did not allow of any social relationship to be established between the 
two parties. Hence marriage relationship between Muslim men and disbelieving 
women, as well as those between Muslim women and the disbelieving men, could 
no longer be maintained. 

c (11) It is a case in which a Muslim husband is allowed to recoup the loss 
sustained of the dowry of a disbelieving wife who has deserted him, from the sum 
due for the payment of dowry for a Muslim woman who has fled from the 
disbelievers and joined the Muslims, or from acquisitions gained in war. 



60 : 12 • FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH NON-MUSLIMS 693 

12 O Prophet, when believing women come to you giving you 
a pledge that they will not set up any partner with Allah, and will 
not steal, nor commit adultery; nor kill their children, nor bring a 
slander which they have forged of themselves, nor disobey you in 
what is good, accept their pledge, and ask forgiveness for them 
from Allah. Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 13 you who 
believe, do not take for friends a people with whom Allah is 
displeased — they indeed despair of the Hereafter, as the 
disbelievers despair of those in the graves. 



a (12) Most of the commentators think that the pledge spoken of in this verse 
was only taken by the Holy Prophet after the conquest of Makkah, when large 
numbers of women as well as men embraced Islam. 

b (13) The reference is to the Jews. (Editor's Note: Verses 8 and 9 have 
already made it clear that friendly relations are only disallowed with those who 
actually fight against Muslims on account of their religion, and are allowed with 
all others.) 



Chapter 61 
Ai-saff Ranks 

The title of this chapter is taken from the command in v. 4 to fight in defence 
of the faith in Ranks. It speaks first of Moses and Jesus, and the latter's 
prophecy regarding the advent of the Holy Prophet Muhammad, and this is 
followed by a prophecy of the triumph of Islam over all other religions. Then 
it exhorts Muslims to strive hard in the cause of truth, citing the example of 
Jesus. The date of revelation is very probably 1 or 2 A.H. 



Section 1: Triumph of Islam 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth 
glorifies Allah; and He is the Mighty, the Wise. 

2 O you who believe, why do you say things which you do 
not do? 3 It is most hateful in the sight of Allah that you say things 
which you do not do. a 4 Surely Allah loves those who fight in His 
way in ranks, as if they were a solid wall. 

5 And when Moses said to his people: My people, why do 
you malign me, when you know that I am Allah's messenger to 
you? c But when they deviated, Allah made their hearts deviate. 
And Allah does not guide the transgressing people. 6 And when 
Jesus, son of Mary, said: Children of Israel, surely I am the 
messenger of Allah to you, verifying what is (already) before me 
of the Torah and giving the good news of a Messenger who will 



a (3) It is an exhortation to those who professed belief in the Truth to make 
their actions correspond with their assertions. The triumph of Truth, which is so 
definitely foretold in this chapter, could not be brought about by boastful talk but 
by great deeds of sacrifice, and hence this prelude. Mere words, if not carried into 
action, are hateful to God. It is deeds that open the way to success. 

b (4) They had to fight in self-defence; see 2:190 etc. 

c(5) See 33:69 footnote.

come after me, his name being Ahmad. a But when he came to 
them with clear arguments, they said: This is clear enchantment. 

7 And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against 



a (6-1) We are here told that Jesus had given the good news of the advent of 
a Prophet whose name was Ahmad coming after him. That our Prophet was 
known by two names Muhammad and Ahmad is a well-known fact of history. As 
regards the sayings of Jesus, we have to depend on a Greek translation, in which 
we find the word Paraclete, which is translated in English as Comforter. How- 
ever, the use of the word Paraclete in the Greek version, or that of Comforter in 
the English version, does not show what the actual word in the language spoken 
by Jesus was. But all those qualifications which are given in John 14:16 and 16:7 
are met with in the person of the Holy Prophet Muhammad. He is stated to be one 
who shall abide forever, and so is the Prophet's law; for after him comes no pro- 
phet to promulgate a new law. He is spoken of as teaching all things, and it was 
with a perfect law that the Holy Prophet came. And clearest of all are the words of 
John 16:12-14: "I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them 
now. However, when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all 
truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will 
speak; and he will tell you things to come. He will glorify me, ...". Now, this 
prophecy about the Spirit of Truth, which is the same as the Comforter, clearly 
stated in John 14:17, establishes the following points: (1) Jesus could not guide 
into all truth because his teaching was directed only to the reform of the Israelites, 
and he denounced only their crying evils; but the teaching of the Comforter would 
be a perfect one, guiding people into all truth, and the Quran is the only book 
which claims to be a perfect law. (2) That he would not speak of himself, but what 
he shall hear he shall speak; the words conveying exactly the same idea as those 
of Deut. 18:18: "And I will put My words in his mouth", a qualification which is 
met with only in the Holy Prophet Muhammad. (3) That he will glorify Jesus, and 
the Holy Prophet did glorify Jesus by denouncing as utterly false all those 
calumnies which were heaped upon Jesus and his mother. 

Another point worth mentioning is that the different prophecies about the 
Holy Prophet really refer to the different phases of his life. The two aspects of the 
life of the Holy Prophet arejalal and jamal, i.e., an aspect of glory and an aspect 
of beauty, the first finding its manifestation in the name Muhammad and the 
second in Ahmad. Each of the two great prophets, Moses and Jesus, prophesied 
about the Holy Prophet in words expressing that aspect of his life which was in 
consonance with his own nature — glory finding greater expression in Moses, 
who was prophet, lawgiver and king at the same time, and beauty in Jesus, on 
account of the beauty of his moral teachings, while both these elements were 
combined in the person of the Holy Prophet Muhammad. 

b (6-2) The Holy Prophet Muhammad is referred to here, as the next verse 
clearly shows.

unjust people." 8 They desire to put out the light of Allah with their 
mouths, but Allah will perfect His light, though the disbelievers 
may be averse. 9 He it is Who has sent His Messenger with the 
guidance and the Religion of Truth that He may make it prevail 
over all religions, though those who set up partners (with Allah) 



Section 2: Establishment of Truth needed Sacrifices 

10 O you who believe, shall I lead you to a bargain which will 
deliver you from a painful punishment? 11 You should believe in 
Allah and His Messenger, and strive hard in Allah's way with 
your wealth and your lives. That is better for you, if only you knew! 
12 He will forgive you your sins and make you enter Gardens in 
which rivers flow, and goodly dwellings in Gardens of perpetuity 
— that is the mighty achievement — 13 and yet another (blessing) 
that you love: help from Allah and a victory near at hand; and give 
good news to the believers. c 

14 O you who believe, be helpers (in the cause) of Allah, as 
Jesus, son of Mary, said to the disciples: Who are my helpers in 



a (7) The words, "he who forges a lie against Allah and he is invited to 
Islam", refer to the rejectors who called the truth an enchantment. It was these 
people that were invited to Islam, while the Prophet was an inviter, as he is else- 
where called, for instance, 3:193, 20:108. Their polytheistic beliefs are repeatedly 
called a forgery in the Quran. Or, the Christians are meant who were invited to the 
Truth, but they forged a lie that Jesus was the son of God and that he took away 
their sins. 

b (9) Verses 8 and 9 contain two different prophecies. The first is that all 
attempts to annihilate Islam will fail, and they did fail. In the second it is affirmed 
that Islam will be made the predominant religion, the truth of which was witnessed 
by Arabia in the lifetime of the Holy Prophet. But both prophecies have a wider 
significance. Attempts are still being made to annihilate Islam, and the Divine 
promise is that all these attempts shall be brought to naught; while the predomi- 
nance of Islam over all the religions of the world would in time be established, as 
clearly as it was in Arabia. 

c (13) The prophecy in the previous verse relates to the Hereafter, while that 
in this verse relates to the victories of the Muslims over the disbelievers. 



61:14' TRIUMPH OF ISLAM 697 

the cause of Allah? The disciples said: We are helpers (in the 
cause) of Allah. So a party of the Children of Israel believed and 
another party disbelieved; then We aided those who believed 
against their enemy, and they became predominant." 



a (14) The description applies to the triumph of the teachings of Christ over 
those who opposed the dissemination of his teachings, and speaks prophetically of 
the ultimate triumph of Islam over all other religions of the world. 



Chapter 62 
Ai-jumu'ah The Congregation 

This chapter is named after the exhortation in v. 9 to Muslims to gather 
together for prayer on the day of Congregation or Friday. It states that the 
Holy Prophet was a purifier and teacher of his immediate followers as well as 
those to come in later ages. Then it warns Muslims, by referring to the trans- 
gressions of the Jews, against observing only the letter of the law while 
having no understanding of it and thinking of themselves as God's favourites. 
Lastly, as the Jews had neglected their Sabbath and suffered as a result, 
Muslims are exhorted to give special importance to the Friday prayer, which 
in Islam replaces the Sabbath. The date of revelation of this chapter is very 
probably 1 A.H. 



Section 1 : Muslims to receive Divine Favours 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth 
glorifies Allah, the King, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise. 

2 He it is Who raised among the illiterates a Messenger from 
among themselves, who recites to them His messages and purifies 
them, and teaches them the Book and the Wisdom — although 
they were before certainly in manifest error — 3 and others from 
among them who have not yet joined them. And He is the Mighty, 
the Wise." 4 That is Allah's grace; He grants it to whom He pleases. 
And Allah is the Lord of mighty grace. 

5 The likeness of those who were charged with the Torah, 
then they did not observe it, is as the likeness of the donkey 



a (3) The significance is that after a time, when the true spirit of Islam would 
have been lost, a man would be raised who, again receiving the light from the Holy 
Prophet, would spread the light of Islam in the world. But some commentators 
understand that non-Arabs, or all Muslims coming after the Prophet, are meant. 
The Prophet would thus be the teacher forever, through his disciples, and no 
Israelite prophet would be sent as a teacher to the Muslim community.

carrying books. Evil is the likeness of the people who reject the 
messages of Allah. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing 
people. 

6 Say: O you who are Jews, if you think that you are the 
favourites of Allah to the exclusion of other people, then invoke 
death, if you are truthful." 7 But they will never invoke it because 
of what their hands have already done. And Allah is Knower of 
the wrongdoers. 8 Say: The death from which you flee, that will 
surely overtake you; then you will be sent back to the Knower of 
the unseen and the seen, so He will inform you of what you did. 

Section 2: Friday Prayer 

9 O you who believe, when the call is sounded for prayer on 
Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business. 
That is better for you, if you know. 10 But when the prayer is ended,

much, that you may be successful. n And when they see trading or 
entertainment (taking place), they break away to it, and leave you 
standing/ Say: What is with Allah is better than entertainment and 
trading. And Allah is the Best of providers. 



a (6) See 2:94. 

b (9) The Friday service, just after noon, is preceded by a sermon. Verses 9- 
10 show that ordinary business may be carried on by a Muslim on Friday before 
or after the Friday prayer. Hence, unlike the Jewish and the Christian Sabbaths, it 
is not necessarily a day of rest. But attendance at these prayers is obligatory, and 
as soon as the call to prayer is sounded, every Muslim is bound to leave business 
of every kind and immediately hasten to the mosque. Every nation has a Sabbath, 
or a so-called day of Divine service set apart from the ordinary weekdays, but in 
practice, the whole day is never given to prayer. In fact, a Muslim, who is allowed 
to do his ordinary work on Friday, gives more time to his prayers than the majority 
of those who recognize a seventh day as their Sabbath. The idea underlying the 
Sabbath is, no doubt, a temporary cessation of material activities, to give place to 
spiritual exercise. Islam, on the other hand, requires communion with the Divine 
Being to be observed throughout the entire week, five times daily. 

c (11) Those spoken of here are apparently the hypocrites. The fact that the 
next chapter deals with the hypocrites corroborates this. 



Chapter 63 
Ai-Munafiqun The Hypocrites 

This chapter deals with the hypocrites and condemns hypocrisy. It speaks of 
their false promises and their desire to see Islam wiped out, and concludes 
with an exhortation to Muslims not to be led away by love of wealth and off- 
spring. This chapter was revealed very probably in 3 A.H. 



Section 1 : The Hypocrites 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 When the hypocrites come to you, they say: We bear witness 
that you are indeed Allah's Messenger. And Allah knows you are 
indeed His Messenger. And Allah bears witness that the hypo- 
crites are surely liars. 2 They take shelter under their oaths, thus 
turning (people) from Allah's way. Surely evil is what they do. 
3 That is because they believed, then disbelieved; thus their hearts 
are sealed, so they do not understand." 

4 And when you see them, their appearances please you; and 
if they speak, you listen to their speech. They are like pieces of 
wood, clad with garments. They think every cry to be against them.* 
They are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allah destroy them! 
How they are turned away (from truth)! 5 And when it is said to 
them: Come, the Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you, 
they turn away their heads and you see them hindering (others), 
and they are big with pride. 6 It is the same to them whether you 
ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them — 



a (3) Note how the sealing of hearts is described here. It is a person's own 
action which is the cause, while the sealing is only the necessary consequence. 

b (4) By the cry is here meant the hostile incursion of the enemy. Whenever 
there was an incursion of the enemy, the hypocrites showed cowardice and thought 
that the Muslims would be crushed by their adversaries.

63 : 7 • AN EXHORTATION 701 

Allah will never forgive them. Surely Allah does not guide the 
transgressing people. 

7 They it is who say: Do not spend on those who are with the 
Messenger of Allah that they may disperse. And Allah's are the 
treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not 
understand. 8 They say: If we return to Madinah, the mightier will 
surely drive out the weaker from it. And might belongs to Allah 
and His Messenger and the believers, but the hypocrites do not 
know. 

Section 2: An Exhortation 

9 O you who believe, do not let your wealth nor your children 
divert you from the remembrance of Allah; and whoever does that, 
these are the losers. 10 And spend (on good works) out of what We 
have given you before death comes to one of you, and he says: My 
Lord, why did You not grant me respite for a little while (longer), 
so that I should have given in charity and been among the doers of 
good deeds? n But Allah does not respite a soul, when its term 
comes. And Allah is Aware of what you do. 



a (8) So late as this revelation, the hypocrites considered themselves, in con- 
junction with their disbelieving friends, to be the stronger party and the Muslims 
to be the weaker party, whom they could easily drive out of Madinah. But they 
are told that they themselves will meet with disgrace. Ultimately their opposition 
came to naught; see 9:101. 



Chapter 64 
Ai-Taghabun Manifestation of Losses 

This chapter refers in v. 9 to the day of the Manifestation of Losses. It not 
only warns the disbelievers of the evil consequences of their deeds but also 
exhorts the believers to continue their march towards spiritual advancement 
and not to be led away by worldly attractions. Not only will disbelievers find 
their losses manifested on a certain day, but believers will also find such 
losses manifested if they have been remiss in fulfilling their obligations. This 
chapter was revealed in the early days at Madinah. 



Section 1 : Disbelievers warned 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth 
glorifies Allah. His is the kingdom, and His the praise; and He is 
Powerful over all things. 2 He it is Who created you, but one of 
you is a disbeliever and one of you is a believer. And Allah is Seer 
of what you do. 3 He created the heavens and the earth with truth, 
and He shaped you, then made goodly your shapes; and to Him is 
the destination. 4 He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, 
and He knows what you hide and what you manifest. And Allah is 
Knower of what is in the hearts. 

5 Has not the story come to you of those who disbelieved before, 
then they tasted the evil consequences of their conduct, and they 
had a painful punishment? 'That is because their messengers came 
to them with clear arguments, but they said: Shall mortals guide 
us? So they disbelieved and turned away, and Allah is above all 
need. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praised. 

7 Those who disbelieve think that they will not be raised. Say: 
Indeed, by my Lord! you will certainly be raised; then you will 
certainly be informed of what you did. And that is easy to Allah. 
8 So believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Light which We 
have revealed. And Allah is Aware of what you do. 9 The day 
when He will gather you for the day of Gathering, that is the day 



702

of the Manifestation of losses." And whoever believes in Allah 
and does good, He will remove from him his evil and make him 
enter Gardens in which rivers flow, to abide in them forever. That 
is the mighty achievement.* 10 And those who disbelieve and reject 
Our messages, they are the companions of the Fire, abiding in it; 
and evil is the destination. 

Section 2: An Exhortation 

11 No calamity befalls but by Allah's permission. And who- 
ever believes in Allah, He guides his heart. And Allah is Knower 
of all things. 12 And obey Allah and obey the Messenger; but if you 
turn away, the duty of Our Messenger is only to deliver the message 
clearly. 13 Allah, there is no God but He. And on Allah let the 
believers rely. 

14 O you who believe, surely some among your wives and 
your children are enemies to you, so beware of them. c And if you 
pardon and forbear and forgive, surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
15 Your wealth and your children are only a trial, and Allah — with 
Him is a great reward. 16 So keep your duty to Allah as much as 
you can, and hear and obey and spend (on good works); it is better 
for your souls. And whoever is saved from the greediness of his 
soul, these it is that are the successful. 17 If you set apart for Allah 
a goodly portion, He will double it for you and forgive you. And 
Allah is the Multiplier (of rewards), Forbearing, 18 the Knower of 
the unseen and the seen, the Mighty, the Wise. 



a (9-1) The day of Resurrection is called the day of Taghabun (Manifesta- 
tion of losses) because the loss that a person suffers is generally hidden from his 
eyes in this life, and it will be manifest on the day of Judgment. 

b (9-2) Note that he who acts righteously will have his evil removed, 
because a change comes over his life. There is no doubt that, when a complete 
transformation takes place in the life of a person, the consequences of the evil 
which he might have previously done are wiped out. 

c (14) It is most often for the sake of one's wife and children that one acts 
wrongfully towards others. Thus, in some cases, the wife or the children become 
an enemy to man. Note the use of the word min, which shows that it is only some- 
times that wives or offspring lead a man to an evil course. 



Chapter 65 

Al-Talaq Divorce 

This chapter deals in the first half with certain rules regarding divorce; hence 
its title. The second half gives a warning to the opponents and shows that the 
Holy Prophet had brought them light. The date of revelation may be assigned 
approximately as 6 A.H. 



Section 1 : Supplementary Divorce Rules 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them for their 
prescribed period," and calculate the period; and keep your duty to 
Allah, your Lord. Do not turn them out of their houses — nor 
should they themselves go forth — unless they commit an open 
indecency. And these are the limits of Allah. And whoever goes 
beyond the limits of Allah, he indeed wrongs his own soul. Fou do 
not know that Allah may, after that, bring about an event (of 
reunion).* 

2 So when they have reached their prescribed time, retain them 



a (1-1) The prescribed time is ordinarily, according to 2:228, three courses. 
But in the case of pregnant women, and in certain other cases, the prescribed time 
is laid down in v. 4 of this chapter. It should be noted how every direction in 
connection with the subject of divorce is followed by the injunction, keep your 
duty to Allah, throughout this chapter. The utmost carefulness must therefore be 
exercised in the matter of divorce. Divorce is allowed but the right must be used 
sparingly and under exceptional circumstances. 

It is reported that the directions contained in this chapter were needed to 
correct a mistake made in connection with the law of divorce by Ibn Umar, who 
divorced his wife when she had her courses. He was told to take her back, as 
divorce was ineffective unless pronounced when the wife was not in a menstrual 
period (Bukhari, 68:1). 

b (1-2) The amr or event here means reunion. We are here expressly told 
that a divorced woman is not to be turned out of the husband's house, because 
either party may regret the divorce and a reunion may be brought about. 



704 



65 : 3 • SUPPLEMENTARY DIVORCE RULES 705 

with kindness or part from them with kindness, and call to witness 
two just ones from among you, and give upright testimony for 
Allah. With that is instructed he who believes in Allah and the 
Last Day. And whoever keeps his duty to Allah, He ordains a way 
out for him, 3 and gives him sustenance from where he does not 
imagine. And whoever trusts in Allah, He is sufficient for him. 
Surely Allah attains His purpose. Allah indeed has appointed a 
measure for everything. 

4 And those of your women who despair of menstruation, if 
you have a doubt, their prescribed time is three months, and of 
those, too, who have not had their courses. And the pregnant 
women, their prescribed time is that they lay down their burden. 
And whoever keeps his duty to Allah, He makes his affair easy for 
him. 5 That is the command of Allah, which He has revealed to 
you. And whoever keeps his duty to Allah, He will remove from 
him his evils and increase (his) reward for him. 

6 Lodge them where you live according to your means, and 
do not injure them in order to impose hardship upon them. And if 
they are pregnant, spend on them until they lay down their burden. 
Then if they suckle for you, give them their recompense, and 
enjoin one another to do good; and if you disagree, another will 
suckle for him. 7 Let him who has abundant means spend out of his 
abundance, and whoever has his means of subsistence restricted for 
him, let him spend out of what Allah has given him. Allah does 
not lay on any soul a burden beyond what He has given it. Allah 
brings about ease after difficulty." 

Section 2: Makkah warned 

8 And how many a town there was which rebelled against the 
commandment of its Lord and His messengers, so We called it to 
severe account and We punished it with a stern punishment! 9 So it 



a (7) The wife should be lodged where a man himself lives, so that, after 
divorce, the woman has the full status of a wife so long as the prescribed time has 
not expired. If a man possesses abundant wealth, he must spend on his wife 
abundantly. 



706 65. DIVORCE • 65 : 10 

tasted the evil consequences of its conduct, and the end of its affair 
was ruin. 10 Allah has prepared for them severe punishment, so keep 
your duty to Allah, you people of understanding, who believe. 
Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder — n a Messenger 
who recites to you the clear messages of Allah, so that he may 
bring forth those who believe and do good deeds from darkness 
into light. And whoever believes in Allah and does good deeds, 
He will make him enter Gardens in which rivers flow, to abide in 
them forever. Allah has indeed given him a goodly sustenance. 

12 Allah is He Who created seven heavens, and of the earth the 
like of them (in number). The command descends among them, 
that you may know that Allah is Powerful over all things, and that 
Allah encompasses all things in (His) knowledge." 



a (12) The statement made here, that there are "seven heavens, and of the 
earth the like of them", throws light upon what is meant by heavens where the 
number seven is mentioned. The seven heavens are elsewhere called the seven ways 
(23:17) and the seven earths may therefore be the seven major planets of the solar 
system, the earth itself being the eighth, their orbits being spoken of as the seven 
heavens or seven ways. It should, however, be borne in mind that the heavens are 
often referred to without a limitation of number, and include the whole of the 
starry creation. Another point worth noting is that the mention of seven heavens 
does not preclude the existence of more. For the application of the word seven and 
for further discussion, see 2:29 footnote 2. 

The descending of the command among these is interpreted by some as 
meaning the existence of life and death in them. 



Chapter 66 
Ai-Tahrim The Prohibition 

This chapter is called The Prohibition from the statement in v. 1 that the 
Prophet, as well as those who follow him, should not forbid themselves what 
Allah has made lawful. It refers to an incident of the Prophet's temporary 
separation from his wives. The first half speaks of the relations of the Holy 
Prophet with his wives, while the second refers to the spiritual progress to be 
made by his faithful followers. The connection between the two is that the 
spiritual relation between the Prophet and a true follower of his is metaphori- 
cally that between husband and wife. In the last two verses both disbelievers 
and believers are compared to certain women in religious history. The date of 
revelation may be placed about 7 A.H. 



Section 1 : Holy Prophet's Domestic Relations 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O Prophet, why do you forbid (yourself) what Allah has made 
lawful for you? Do you seek to please your wives? And Allah is 
Forgiving, Merciful." 2 Allah indeed has sanctioned for you the 
expiation of your oaths; and Allah is your Patron, and He is the 
Knowing, the Wise. 6 

3 And when the Prophet confided an information to one of his 
wives — but when she disclosed it (to others), and Allah informed 
him of it, he made known part of it and passed over (another) part. 
So when he told her of it, she said: Who informed you of this? He 
said: The Knowing, the One Aware, informed me. c 4 If both of 



a (1) The reference here is to the well-known temporary separation from his 
wives which the Prophet resorted to, on account of his wives demanding more of 
worldly comforts (see 33:28), regarding which the Holy Prophet made a vow. 

b (2) The expiation of oaths is sanctioned in 5:89. The custom off/a', or 
making a vow not to have conjugal relations with one's wife, is mentioned as an 
introduction to the subject of divorce in 2:226, but it is actually prohibited here. 

c (3) There is no trustworthy report showing what particular incident is

you (wives) turn to Allah, then indeed your hearts are inclined (to 
this already); and if you back up one another against him, then 
surely Allah is his Patron, and Gabriel and the righteous believers, 
and the angels after that are the aiders. 5 Maybe, his Lord, if he 
divorce you, will give him in your place wives better than you: 
submitting (to Allah), believing, obedient (to Allah), penitent, ser- 
ving (Allah), fasting, widows, and virgins. a 

6 O you who believe, save yourselves and your families from 
a Fire whose fuel is people and stones; over it are angels, stern and 
strong. They do not disobey Allah in what He commands them, 
but do as they are commanded. 7 you who disbelieve, make no 
excuses this day. You are rewarded only as you did. 

Section 2: Progress of the Faithful 

8 O you who believe, turn to Allah with sincere repentance. It 
may be your Lord will remove from you your evil and make you 
enter Gardens in which rivers flow, on the day on which Allah 
will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believe with him. 
Their light will gleam before them and on their right hands — 
they will say: Our Lord, make perfect for us our light, and grant us 
protection; surely You are Powerful over all things.* 9 Prophet, 

referred to here. But as these verses speak of the temporary separation of the Holy 
Prophet from his wives, it is likely that this incident was also in connection with 
that separation. From what is related in connection with this incident, it appears 
that originally Aishah and Hafsah led this demand and later on the other wives 
joined. And when the Prophet on receiving Divine revelation gave an option to his 
wives either to remain in his house without more worldly comforts or to part 
company with him and have the desired comforts, he told Aishah not to take a 
decision without consulting her parents (Bukhari, 46:25). Maybe it was this matter 
which Aishah disclosed to the others, and hence their united decision to remain in 
the Prophet's house with all the worldly privations. 

a (5) This shows that all those qualifications which are mentioned here were 
met with in the Holy Prophet's wives. He had been given a choice to divorce any 
of his wives whom he did not desire but, when the wives decided not to leave him 
despite the extreme austerity of his home life, he did not divorce any of them; see 
33:51-52. 

b (8) Paradise is not only a place to enjoy the blessings and reap the reward 
of one's previous good deeds, but it is also the starting-point of a never-ceasing 



66:10' PROGRESS OF THE FAITHFUL 709 

strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites," and remain firm 
against them, and their abode is hell; and evil is the destination. 

10 Allah sets forth an example for those who disbelieve — 
the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were both under two 
of Our righteous servants, but they acted treacherously towards 
them, so they (the husbands) did not avail them at all against (the 
punishment of) Allah, and it was said: Enter the Fire with those 
who enter.* 

11 And Allah sets forth an example for those who believe — 
the wife of Pharaoh, when she said: My Lord, build for me a 
house with You in the Garden and deliver me from Pharaoh and 
his work, and deliver me from the wrongdoing people.' 12 And 
Mary, the daughter of Amran, who guarded her chastity, so We 
breathed into him of Our inspiration, and she accepted the truth of 
the words of her Lord and His Books, and she was of the obedient 



spiritual advancement. The prayer for the perfection of the light is an unceasing 
desire for perfection, showing that spiritual progress in that life will be endless. 

a (9) The verb translated as strive is jahid, from which is derived the word 
jihad, and the context shows that by striving is not meant the carrying on of a war, 
for war was never proclaimed against the hypocrites, who, in fact, were for all 
practical purposes treated as Muslims. Therefore, when the Holy Prophet is 
commanded to carry on a jihad against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, it is 
clear that jihad is something else than mere fighting. 

b (10) This is an instance of the followers of prophets going against the prin- 
ciples of their teachers. Those prophets will not be able to save them. 

c (11) This is an example of good men who are not yet made free from the 
bondage of sin, for which Pharaoh stands here as a typical example; but they 
ardently desire to be rid of sin, striving hard to free themselves from all trammels. 

d(\2) The example of the righteous given in this parable illustrates how 
Divine inspiration is granted to the perfect ones. The words "We breathed into him 
of Our inspiration" are remarkable. Evidently the word him cannot refer to Mary. 
It is taken by some commentators to refer to Jesus, and thus the meaning is that 
Mary gave birth to a son who received Divine inspiration. But the reference in the 
personal pronoun him might as well be to the believer for whom Mary is set as an 
example, and the object of the change might be to draw attention to the fact that it 
is really the granting of inspiration to the believer that is meant here and not the 
breathing of a soul. {Editor '$ Note: Verses 11-12 put before Muslims examples of 
women to follow for reaching the highest degrees of righteousness.) 



Chapter 67 
Ai-Muik The Kingdom 

From here to the end of the Holy Quran there are 48 chapters all revealed 
during the Makkah period of the Holy Prophet's life, except ch. 110 which 
was revealed near the very end of his life. All of these contain prophecies of 
the greatness to which Islam would rise during the time of the Holy Prophet 
and later into the distant future, even though these are mostly very early reve- 
lations. The title of this chapter is taken from the statement in the first verse 
that The Kingdom is in Allah's hand, meaning that the prophesied Kingdom 
of God was now about to be established on earth. The chapter then draws 
attention to the working of laws in the physical world, from which it is 
inferred that there is a law relating to good and evil working in the spiritual 
world. The second half of the chapter speaks of the doom that awaits those 
who disbelieve due to their ungratefulness to God. 



Section 1 : The Kingdom of God 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 



£P 1 Blessed is He in Whose hand is the Kingdom, and He is 

«■ Powerful over all things, a 2 Who created death and life that He 

^e might try you (as to) which of you is best in deeds.* And He is the 

Mighty, the Forgiving, 3 Who created the seven heavens alike. e 



a (1) The short chapters revealed at Makkah, which are no doubt generally 
among the earliest revelations of the Holy Prophet, often speak most forcibly of 
the greatness and glory of Allah. The statement here refers prophetically to the 
kingdom of Islam, which was really the kingdom of God. 

b (2) The law of life and death or growth and decay works throughout nature, 
but in case of man death does not end his life, but is really the starting-point for a 
new life of spiritual progress. Life to him below is a trial, i.e., a means of bringing 
to light his hidden qualifications for the performance of good. There is also the 
life and death of nations. Nations that work evil are swept away, and others are 
raised in their place that they may do good. 

c (3-1) Alike (tibaq) here means conforming or corresponding to one another. 
This significance suits the context, for the verse goes on to describe the uni- 
formity prevailing in nature. 



710 



67 : 4 • THE KINGDOM OF GOD 71 1 

Fou see no anomaly in the creation of the Beneficent. Then look 
again: Can you see any disorder?" 4 Then look again and again — 
jour sight will return to you confused, while it is fatigued. 

5 And certainly We have adorned this lower heaven with 
lamps and We make them means of conjectures for the devils,* 
and We have prepared for them the punishment of burning. 6 And 
for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the punishment of hell, 
and evil is the destination. 7 When they are cast into it, they will 
hear a loud moaning of it as it heaves, 8 almost bursting for fury. 
Whenever a group is cast into it, its keepers ask them: Did not a 
warner come to you? 9 They say: Yes, indeed a warner came to us, 
but we denied and said: Allah has revealed nothing; you are only 
in great error. 

10 And they say: If only we had listened or pondered, we 
should not have been among the inmates of the burning Fire. 
n Thus they will confess their sins; so far (from good) are the 
inmates of the burning Fire. 12 Those who fear their Lord in secret, 
for them is surely forgiveness and a great reward. 13 And (whether 
you) conceal your word or speak it openly, truly He is Knower of 
what is in the hearts. 14 Does He, Who created, not know? And He 
is the Knower of subtleties, the Aware. 



a (3-2) Attention is here called to the regularity and uniformity of the laws 
working in nature. There is no anomaly, so that things belonging to the same class 
should be subject to different laws, nor is there a disorder, so that a law should not 
work uniformly. The verse, while calling attention to the existence of a Supreme 
Being, as witnessed in the regularity and uniformity of the laws working in crea- 
tion, draws special attention to spiritual laws, which also work uniformly, and 
thus evil and good must each bring its special reward. 

b (5) The lamps with which the lower heaven is lighted, i.e., the stars, are 
made the means of conjectures regarding the future by the astrologers. The word 
rujum is the plural of rajm which, according to many early authorities, is used to 
signify conjectures and surmises. Thus the astrologers, who deceived people by 
telling them many things which they posed as having learned from the stars, are 
referred to here as the devils making conjectures.

Section 2: The Disbelievers' Doom 

15 He it is Who made the earth subservient to you, so go 
about in its spacious sides, and eat from His sustenance. And to 
Him is the rising (after death). 16 Do you feel secure that He Who 
is in the heaven will not make the earth to swallow you up? Then 
lo! it will shake." 17 Or do you feel secure that He Who is in the 
heaven will not send on you a violent wind? ' Then shall you know 
how (truthful) was My warning! 18 And certainly those before them 
denied, then how (terrible) was My disapproval! 

19 Do they not see the birds above them spreading and 
contracting (their wings)? Nothing upholds them except the 
Beneficent. c Surely He is Seer of all things. 20 Or who is it that will 
be an army for you to help you against the Beneficent? The 
disbelievers are only in delusion. 21 Or who is it that will give you 
sustenance, if He should withhold His sustenance? But they per- 
sist in disdain and aversion. 22 Is, then, he who goes along falling 
upon his face better guided or he who walks upright on a straight 
path? 

23 Say: He it is Who brought you into being and made for 
you ears and eyes and hearts. Little thanks you give! 24 Say: He it 



a (16) God is spoken of here as being in heaven; elsewhere He is spoken of 
as being in heaven and earth alike (43:84); and again He is spoken of as being 
"with you wherever you are" (57:4). The one thing certain is that God is not in 
one particular place to the exclusion of other places. Punishment sent by God is 
often described as coming from heaven, and thus He is spoken of here as being in 
heaven, or above all, so that none can avert the punishment sent by Him. 

b (17) In the well-known Battle of the Allies in 4 A.H., when an army of 
twenty thousand was besieging Madinah and the Muslims were almost helpless 
against this mighty force, it was a violent wind which put all the armies to flight; 
see 33:9. 

c (19) The withholding of the birds signifies the delay of the punishment, for 
birds are spoken of as following a victorious army; see 16:79 footnote. The ques- 
tion in the next verse as to who will help them corroborates this significance. 

rf(21) This is also a prophecy. Their sustenance was withheld in the great 
famine which prevailed at Makkah, prophecies regarding which are met with in 
the Quran in early as well as later revelation; see 44: 10.

is Who multiplies you in the earth and to Him you will be 
gathered. 25 And they say: When will this promise come to pass, if 
you are truthful? 26 Say: The knowledge is with Allah only, and I 
am only a plain warner. 27 But when they see it near at hand, the 
faces of those who disbelieve will be grieved, and it will be said: 
This is what you used to call for. 

28 Say: Have you considered if Allah should destroy me and 
those with me — rather He will have mercy on us — yet who will 
protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment?" 29 Say: He is 
the Beneficent — we believe in Him and on Him do we rely. So 
you will come to know who it is that is in clear error. 30 Say: Have 
you considered if your water should subside, who is it then that 
will bring you flowing water? 



a (28) The meaning is that the guilty will by all means be called to account 
and suffer the evil consequences of what they have done, whether the Prophet and 
his companions live or die, but the uncertainty as to the reward of the righteous is 
at once removed by the words rather He will have mercy on us. The particle au 
(usually meaning 'or') can mean rather as well. 



Chapter 68 
Ai-Qaiam The Pen 

This chapter begins by presenting the inkstand, the pen and all writings to 
bear witness that the Holy Prophet's utterances are not those of an insane 
person, as alleged by his opponents; hence its name The Pen. It goes on to set 
forth a parable foretelling that the struggles of his opponents will fail and 
they will regret what they did. It concludes by referring to the example of 
Jonah, to show the need to wait patiently for the eventual prophesied success. 
This chapter is undoubtedly one of the earliest revelations, and may be placed 
third in the chronological order of revelation. It is notable that even such an 
early revelation declares the Quran to be a reminder for all the nations of the 
world, as stated in its last verse. 



Section 1: Not a Madman's Message 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 (By) the inkstand" and the pen and what they write! 2 By the 
grace of your Lord you are not mad. 3 And surely yours is a reward 



a (1) Nun, with which this verse begins, while being a letter of the Arabic 
alphabet, is also a word meaning inkstand. The context, which mentions pen and 
writing, favours this interpretation. It is not an abbreviation such as those 
occurring at the commencement of chapters 2, 3 etc. The Quran, in the earliest 
abbreviation used in it, gives us a clue to the significance of the abbreviations 
occurring in it by using nun, which is also a word. 

The verse also has a wider significance, indicating that the Quran will 
always continue to occupy a unique position among all the books which are ever 
written. This unique position consists in its completeness and exhaustive dealing 
with all the truths about religion. See also 25:33 footnote. 

b (2) The first allegation of the disbelievers against the Holy Prophet was 
that he was mad. This allegation is dealt with in this chapter. The first answer to it 
is contained in verses 1-2. In v. 1, attention is really called to the fact that the 
Prophet's prophecies about his own future and the fate of the opponents, which 
were already put down in writing, would prove that the Prophet was not mad, for 
the ravings of a madman could not bear fruit. It should be noted that the Quran 
again and again challenges its opponents to write down their prophecies about the 
Holy Prophet, thus showing that its own were actually written down from the 
first, as this chapter is one of the earliest revelations. See also v. 47 and 52:41.

never to be cut off." 4 And surely you have sublime morals. 
s So you will see, and they (too) will see, 'which of you is mad. 
7 Surely jour Lord knows best who strays from His path, and He 
knows best those who go aright. 

8 So do not obey the rejectors. 9 They wish that you should 
soften, so they (too) would soften (in their opposition). 6 10 And do 
not obey any mean swearer, n defamer, going about with slander, 
12 hinderer of good, overstepping the limits, sinful, "dishonour- 
able, (and) besides all that, notoriously mischievous — "because 
he possesses wealth and sons. 15 When Our messages are recited to 
him, he says: Stories of the ancients! 16 We shall brand him on the 
snout. 6 

17 We shall try them as We tried the owners of the garden, 
when they swore to pluck its fruits in the morning/ 18 and would 



a (3) The Prophet is further told that his exertions will be followed by a 
reward which will never be cut off, i.e., he will be successful in establishing a 
religion whose blessings will continue forever, while a madman's actions cannot 
bear any fruit. Thus there is not only a clear prophecy here of the final triumph of 
the Prophet over his enemies, but there is also a prophecy that what is stated in the 
Quran rests on such a firm foundation that it will never prove untrue. 

b (4) The Prophet's possession of the most sublime morals is a further proof 
that he cannot be a madman. He had already won from his contemporaries the 
recognition of his sublime morality, who had given him the title of al-Amin, the 
faithful one. By calling him al-Amin, the people expressed their high appreciation 
of his sublime morality, as if he were the one, and only one, as indicated by pre- 
fixing al, who could be trusted in all matters. His moral greatness was thus testi- 
fied to by Aishah, than whom none was more intimate with the Prophet, who said: 
His morals are the Quran; meaning that all the pictures of sublime morality 
depicted by the Quran are really a glimpse of the moral greatness of the Prophet. 

c (9) The first desire of the Quraish was no doubt, owing to their great respect 
for the Holy Prophet, that he should not condemn their evil deeds in strong lan- 
guage, and thus they too would not be severe in opposition to him. 

d (13) The description applies to all leaders of opposition to Truth. As against 
the sublime morals of the Inviter to Truth, verses 10-13 describe the low state of 
morality of those who do not care for the moral values of life. 

e (16) Branding on the snout is equivalent to bringing a man to disgrace 
which sticks to him. 

/(17) This parable sets forth the ultimate fate of the opponents. It is one of

not set aside a portion (for the poor). 19 But a visitation from your 
Lord came upon it, while they slept. 20 So it became as black, 
barren land — 21 then they called out to one another in the morn- 
ing, 22 saying: Go early to your crop, if you are to pluck (the fruit). 
23 So they went, saying to one another in low voices: 24 no poor 
man shall enter it today against you. 

25 And in the morning they went, having the power to 
prevent. 26 But when they saw it, they said: Surely we are in error; 
27 indeed, we have been deprived. 28 The best of them said: Did I 
not say to you, Why do you not glorify (Allah)? 29 They said: Glory 
be to our Lord! surely we were wrongdoers. 30 Then they turned to 
one another, blaming each other. 31 Said they: O woe to us! Surely 
we were inordinate — 32 maybe, our Lord will give us instead one 
better than it — surely to our Lord we make petition." 33 Such is 
the punishment. And certainly the punishment of the Hereafter is 
greater, if only they knew! 

Section 2: A Reminder for the Nations 

34 Surely the dutiful have with their Lord Gardens of bliss. 
35 Shall We then make those who submit as the guilty? 36 What is 
the matter with you? How do you judge? 37 0r do you have a book 
in which you read 38 that you shall surely have in it whatever you 
choose? 39 0r do you have covenants from Us on oath, extending 
to the day of Resurrection, that you shall surely have whatever 
you judge? 40 Ask them which of them will vouch for that. 41 Or do 

the earliest prophecies, and it foretells the failure of opposition and shows also 
that the Prophet's heart was full of sympathy for the poor from the very first. 

a (32) It shows that while the Quran threatened the opponents with punish- 
ment, it foretold at the same time that they would accept the Truth ultimately. 
This happened about twenty years afterwards. All their exertions came to naught 
and their power in the land was frustrated, but they then saw their error, came 
over to Islam, and were made the rulers of vast kingdoms. Thus their Lord gave 
them instead one better, because they made their petition to Him. 

b (33) The separate mention of the punishment of the Hereafter is clear 
evidence that the punishment spoken of in the previous verses, referred to at the 
beginning of this verse, was a punishment which was to overtake them in this life, 
and thus to afford a proof of the truth of the chastisement of the Hereafter. 



68 : 42 • A REMINDER FOR THE NATIONS 717 

they have associate-gods? Then let them bring their associate- 
gods, if they are truthful. 

42 On the day when there is a severe affliction, and they are 
called upon to prostrate themselves, but they are not able — 
43 their looks cast down, humiliation will cover them. And they 
were indeed called upon to prostrate themselves, while yet they 
were safe. 44 So leave Me alone with him who rejects this 
announcement. We shall overtake them by degrees, from where 
they do not know. 45 And I bear with them, surely My plan is firm. 
46 0r do you ask from them a reward, so that they are burdened 
with debt? 47 0r is (the knowledge of) the unseen with them so that 
they write (it) down? " 

48 So wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord, and do not 
be like the Companion of the fish,* when he cried while he was in 
distress. 49 If favour from his Lord had not reached him, he would 
certainly have been cast down on naked ground, while he was 
blamed. 50 Then his Lord chose him, and He made him one of the 
righteous. 51 And those who disbelieve would almost strike you 
down with their eyes when they hear the Reminder, and they say: 
Surely he is mad!' 52 And it is nothing but a Reminder for the 
nations. 



a (47) Writing is always mentioned in connection with the knowledge of the 
unseen, because it is writing alone that makes the truth of a prophecy sure. This is 
proof that the Quran itself, containing numerous prophecies, was written from the 
first, otherwise a challenge to the opponents in these early revelations to write 
down the knowledge of the future which they had through their diviners would be 
meaningless. 

b (48) The Prophet Jonah is here called the Companion of the fish because of 
the incident mentioned in 37:142. 

c (51) The chapter ends with the same allegation by the disbelievers as the 
one with which it opened. The last verse, and it is nothing but a Reminder for the 
nations, sums up the arguments against that allegation. Note that even as early as 
this revelation, the Prophet's message is declared to be meant for all nations. 



Chapter 69 
Ai-Haqqah The Sure Truth 

The name of this chapter is the word which constitutes its first verse. Al- 
Haqqah or The Sure Truth is the hour of the triumph of truth and the doom of 
the opponents. After mentioning this, the chapter refers to the fate of the 
earlier nations and says that the Sure Truth is the time of the reward of the 
faithful and punishment of the evil-doers. At the end the chapter deals with 
the allegations of the opponents against the Holy Prophet. This chapter is later 
in revelation than the last chapter as it deals with later allegations that he was 
a poet or a diviner or an impostor. 



Section 1: The Doom 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 The sure Truth! 2 What is the sure Truth? 3 And what would 
make you realize what the sure Truth is?" 4 Thamud and Ad called 
the calamity a lie. 5 Then as for Thamud, they were destroyed by 
the severe punishment. 6 And as for Ad, they were destroyed by a 
roaring, violent wind, 7 which He made to prevail against them for 
seven nights and eight days continuously, so that you could have 
seen the people in it prostrate as if they were trunks of hollow 
palm-trees. 8 So can you see a remnant of them? 

9 And Pharaoh and those before him and the overthrown 
cities c committed evil. 10 And they disobeyed the messenger of 
their Lord, so He punished them with a vehement punishment. 
n Surely We carried you in the ship, when the water rose high, 



a (3) The instances given about Ad and Thamud and Pharaoh and the 
Sodomites, in verses 4-10, show that the real significance of al-haqqah, "the sure 
Truth", is the hour in which the truth will be triumphant. There is no doubt that a 
fuller manifestation of the Truth, and of the requital of those who reject it, will 
take place in the Hereafter, and thus it also means the Resurrection. 

b (5) See 7:78. The severe punishment was an earthquake. 

c (9) The overthrown cities are the cities of Lot; see 1 1 :82.

12 that We might make it a reminder for you, and that the retaining 
ear might retain it." 

13 So when the trumpet is blown with a single blast, 14 and the 
earth and the mountains are borne away and crushed with one 
crash — 15 on that day will the Event come to pass, 16 and the 
heaven will be split apart; so that day it will be frail, 17 and the 
angels will be on its sides. And above them eight will bear that 
day jour Lord's Throne of Power. e 18 On that day you will be 
exposed to view — no secret of yours will remain hidden."' 
19 Then as for him who is given his book in his right hand, he will 
say: Here, read my book. 20 Surely I knew that I should meet my 
account. 21 So he will be in a life of bliss, 22 in a lofty Garden, 



a (12) The reference in verses 1 1-12 is to Noah. 

6(15) The consequences of this Event are described in 56:3; see 56:1 
footnote, where it is shown that the Event, al-Waqi'ah, signifies the doom of the 
opponents in this life, with a full manifestation in the life after death. The passing 
away of the earth and the mountains and their being crushed, signifies the fall of 
the small and great men in connection with that doom. 

c (17) The eight bearers of the Throne of Power (or 'arsh) either represent 
something above the angels, or particular angels above the ordinary angels. 
However, it should be borne in mind that God Himself is al-Qayyum, or the Self- 
Subsisting by Whom all things subsist (2:255), and other things are not a support 
for the Divine Being. There is a saying of the Holy Prophet, reported by all 
commentators, that at present such bearers are four. Now there are four attributes 
of the Divine Being specially connected with the maintenance of the world, and 
these are mentioned in the opening chapter of the Quran in the Divine names: 
Rabb, Rahman, Rahim, and Malik. These represent providence, beneficence, 
mercy and requital, which bring the creation to perfection and from which all 
other attributes may be inferred. Hence these are the four bearers of the Throne of 
Power, so far as this world is concerned. Why are they eight on the day of 
Resurrection? The other world is a complete, but at the same time a new, manifes- 
tation of the spiritual realities of this life. Hence, there is a new manifestation of 
the four attributes of the Divine Being by which the world subsists, and thus these 
four attributes become eight on the day of Resurrection. Note that, as Divine attri- 
butes are brought into action through the agency of angels, the four or eight attributes 
would also be manifested through angels, and in this sense we may look upon the 
bearers of the Throne of Power as being four or eight angels. 

d (18) This verse speaks clearly of the manifestation of the hidden realities 
on the day of Resurrection.

end (of me)! 28 My wealth has not availed me. 29 My authority has 
gone from me. 30 Seize him, then fetter him, 31 then cast him into the 
burning Fire, 32 then insert him in a chain seventy lengths long.* 
33 Surely he did not believe in Allah, the Great, 34 nor did he urge 
the feeding of the poor. 35 Therefore he does not have here this day 
a true friend, 36 nor any food except filth, 37 which none but the 
wrongdoers eat. 

Section 2: False Allegations refuted 

38 But no! I swear by what you see, 39 and what you do not 
see! 40 Surely, it is the word of an honoured Messenger, 41 and it is 



a (23) These fruits are the manifestation of the fruits of righteous deeds. 
They are here spoken of as being near so that they are available in this life too. 

b (32) In these verses the spiritual torture of this world is represented as a 
physical punishment in the next. The chain represents the desires and entangle- 
ments of this world, and it is these desires that will assume the shape of a chain. 
The heart-burnings of this world will likewise be clearly seen as flames of 
burning fire. The wicked one has in this very world within himself a hell of the 
passions and inextinguishable desires of this world, and feels the burning of that 
hell in the failures he encounters. When, therefore, he is cast farther off from his 
temporal desires and sees an everlasting despair before him, his heart-burnings 
and bitter sighs for his dear desires assume the shape of burning Fire. 

The casting into a chain seventy lengths long is significant. Man's limit of 
age may as a general rule be fixed at seventy, and he may sometimes even enjoy 
seventy years excluding the periods of childhood and decrepitude. These seventy 
years during which he could work with honesty, wisdom and zeal are wasted 
away by the wicked one only in the entanglements of the world, and in following 
sensual passions. He does not try to free himself from the chain of desires, and 
therefore in the next world the desires which he indulged in for seventy years will 
be embodied into a chain seventy lengths long, every length representing, as it 
were, a year. (Editor's Note: The word dhira ', used here meaning one length, 
indicates a distance equal to about the length of the lower arm of a man.)

43 It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. 44 And if he 
had fabricated against Us certain sayings, 45 We would certainly 
have seized him by the right hand, 46 then cut off his heart's vein. 
47 And not one of you could have withheld Us from him. a 

48 And surely it is a Reminder for the dutiful. 49 And We cer-

(source of) grief to the disbelievers. 6 51 And surely it is the certain 
Truth. e 52 So glorify the name of your Lord, the incomparably 
Great. 



a (47) Verses 44^7 show that one who fabricates Divine revelation does not 
prosper. Compare Deut. 18:20, where the prophecy of the advent of a Prophet like 
Moses is followed by the words: "But the prophet who presumes to speak a word 
in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the 
name of other gods, that prophet shall die". Jesus' words in Matthew 7:19: "Every 
tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire", after com- 
paring a false prophet with a corrupt tree that does not bring forth good fruit, point 
to a like effect. 

b (50) Because the punishment of which it warns them must overtake them. 

c (51) The haqq al-yaqm, true certainty or certain truth of this verse, is the 
same as al-haqqah of the opening verse. The ultimate triumph of Truth is a 
certain truth. 



Chapter 70 
Ai-Ma'arij The Ways of Ascent 

The title of this chapter is taken from v. 3, where Allah is called the Lord of 
The Ways of Ascent. While holding out the certainty of the punishment, this 
chapter points out at first that great ends are achieved in a long period of 
time. Then we are told that the means of ascent are those by which the faith- 
ful attain nearness to God. At the end it prophesies that a new nation will be 
raised in place of the opponents who will meet with disgrace. This chapter 
was revealed not later than the close of the early period at Makkah. 



Section 1: The Certainty of the Punishment 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 A questioner asks about the punishment to befall 2 the dis- 
believers — there is none to avert it " — 3 from Allah, Lord of the 
ways of Ascent.* 4 To Him ascend the angels and the Spirit in a 
day the length of which is fifty thousand years. c 5 So be patient 
with a goodly patience. 



a (2) No particular questioner is meant. The last chapter speaks in terms of 
the highest certainty of the final triumph of truth and of the doom of the oppo- 
nents, and the question, When will it bel was natural. It is repeated very often: 
"When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful?" (36:48, 67:25, etc.). 

b (3) This indicates that God grants to the faithful the means of Ascent, or of 
exaltation. Compare 56:3, where the Event is spoken of as degrading, exalting. 
The means of exaltation of the believers are pointed out in verses 22-35. 

c (4) Al-Ruh or the Spirit very often stands for Divine revelation or Gabriel, 
who brings the revelation to the Prophet. But here it seems to be a collective name 
for the spirits of the faithful, because it is through Divine revelation that a new 
spirit is awakened in the faithful; see 78:38. The angels are mentioned along with 
the faithful because it is through an angel that spiritual life is breathed into man, 
and he starts life as a spiritual wayfarer. A day of the spiritual advancement of 
man is spoken of as being equal to fifty thousand years to show the immense vast- 
ness of that advancement. Or, the day of fifty thousand years may be the day of 
the final triumph of Truth in the world, from the time when revelation was first 
granted to man.

and his brother, 13 and his kin that gave him shelter, 14 and all that

wealth there is a known right 25 for the beggar and the destitute, 
26 and those who accept the truth of the day of Judgment, 27 and 
those who are fearful of the punishment of their Lord — 28 surely 
the punishment of their Lord is not to be felt secure from — 29 and 
those who restrain their sexual passions, 30 except in the presence 
of their spouses or those whom their right hands possess, for such

that, these are the transgressors. 32 And those who are faithful to 
their trusts and their covenant, 33 and those who are upright in their 
testimonies, 34 and those who keep a guard on their prayer. 35 These 
are in Gardens, honoured.

b (36) Nearly the same words — hastening to the Inviter — occur in 54:8. 
Here and in the verses that follow is a description of the time when these very 
opponents would be hastening on to the Prophet, accepting the truth. V. 38 makes 
it further clear: Does every man of them desire to be admitted to the Garden of 
bliss? 



724 70. THE WAYS OF ASCENT • 70 : 39 

Garden of bliss? 39 By no means! Surely We have created them for 
what they know." 

40 But indeed! I swear by the Lord of the Eastern lands and 
the Western lands! that We are certainly Powerful 41 to bring in 
their place (others) better than them, and We shall not be over- 
come. 6 42 So leave them alone to plunge in idle talk and to sport, 
until they come face to face with that day of theirs which they are 
promised — 43 the day when they come forth from the graves in 
haste, as if racing to a goal, 44 their eyes cast down, disgrace 
covering them. Such is the day which they are promised. c 



a (39) What is negatived here is the fact that the evildoers can enter the 
Garden of bliss. "For what" signifies the end for which man has been created. It is 
to rise above sin, to be able to ascend to God, the Lord of the ways of Ascent; see 
v. 3. The Garden of bliss stands clearly for the Ascension of man to God which is 
the real object of his life. 

b (41) Note the clear prophecy that an evil generation will be brought to 
naught and another people, the righteous, shall inherit the land. The old order will 
be changed and a new order established instead of that. 

c (44) Verses 43-44 give us a clear statement as to the final triumph of Truth 
and the overthrow of opposition or the triumph of righteousness over the powers 
of evil. Being spiritually dead, their very homes were graves in a metaphorical 
sense. As in almost all chapters of this period, the final triumph of Truth runs 
along as an undercurrent in the mention of the Resurrection. 



Chapter 71 
Nah Noah 

This chapter deals entirely with Noah, providing an example of the certainty 
of the threatened punishment of evil. It was revealed in the early period 
at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Noah preaches 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Surely We sent Noah to his people, saying: Warn jour 
people before a painful punishment comes to them. 2 He said: My 
people, surely I am a plain warner to you, 3 that you should serve 
Allah and keep your duty to Him and obey me — 4 He will forgive 
you some of your sins and grant you respite to an appointed term. 
Surely the term of Allah, when it comes, is not postponed. If only 
you knew ! 

5 He said: My Lord, I have called my people night and day, 
6 but my call has only made them flee the more." 7 And whenever I 
call to them that You may forgive them, they thrust their fingers in 
their ears and cover themselves with their garments, and persist 
(in denial) and are big with pride. 8 Then surely I have called to 
them aloud, 9 then spoken to them in public and spoken to them 



a (6) The meaning is: the more I call them, the more they flee. The call is not 
the immediate and effective cause of their flight, which is really due to the stub- 
bornness of their hearts. This is made clear in what follows. Exactly in the same 
sense a chapter of the Quran is spoken of as "adding uncleanness" to the unclean- 
ness of those in whose hearts is a disease (9:125); and on another occasion, 
exactly in the same sense, Allah is spoken of as increasing the disease of those in 
whose hearts is a disease (2:10). 

b (7) Covering themselves with garments is explained as covering their ears 
with their garments, denoting their holding back from giving ear, or as running 
away. Some take garments (thiyab) as meaning the heart, as in 74:4, the meaning 
being that they cover their hearts, refusing to ponder over what is said. 



725 



726 71. NOAH -71:10 

in private, 10 so I have said: Ask forgiveness of your Lord; surely 
He is ever Forgiving, n He will send down upon you rain, pouring 
in abundance, u and help you with wealth and sons, and make for 
you gardens, and make for you rivers." 

13 What is the matter with you that you do not hope for 
greatness from Allah? 14 And indeed He has created you by 
various stages. e 15 Do you not see how Allah has created the seven 
heavens alike, 16 and made the moon in them (as) a light, and made 
the sun a lamp? 17 And Allah has caused you to grow out of the 
earth as a growth, 18 then He returns you to it, then will He bring 
you forth a (new) bringing forth. 6 19 And Allah has made the earth 
a wide expanse for you, 20 that you may go along in it in spacious 
paths/ 



a (12) They are promised various blessings, if they turn to Allah, which 
really means that their doom shall be averted, for nations are no doubt destroyed 
when they indulge in evil inordinately, and they prosper so long as their good 
qualities preponderate. 

b (13) This is the Prophet's address to an evil generation. They are told that 
they can rise to greatness by giving up their evil ways. 

c (14) The words undoubtedly speak of the evolution of man. It is clear from 
v. 1 7, where the first stage is spoken of as a growth from the earth, that the words 
here imply that man has been brought to the present state after passing through 
various conditions. 

d (17) Here man is described as having grown out of the earth as a growth, 
i.e., by a process of development. Thus verses 14 and 17 refer to that great 
process of development through which man has attained to the present stage of 
physical perfection. 

e (18) The new bringing forth is in reference to the Resurrection. It is called 
a new growth to show that it is not the same as man's life on this earth but a new 
life, the life Spiritual. This growth begins in this life, but a complete manifestation 
of it takes place in the Resurrection. 

/(20) The spacious paths made for man's earthly existence are an indication 
of the spiritual paths wherein a God-fearing man attains to spiritual perfection. 
But the mention of spacious paths is also to show that the making of spacious 
roads is necessary for human civilization. 



71 : 21 • DESTRUCTION OF TRANSGRESSORS 727 

Section 2: Destruction of Transgressors 

21 Noah said: My Lord, surely they disobey me and follow 
him whose wealth and children have increased him in nothing but 
loss. 22 And they have planned a mighty plan. 23 And they say: Do 
not abandon your gods; nor abandon Wadd, nor Suwa', nor 
Yaghuth and Ya 'uq and Nasr." 24 And indeed they have led many 
astray. And (my Lord) increase the wrongdoers in nothing but 
ruin.* 25 Because of their wrongs they were drowned, then made to 
enter Fire, so they found no helpers besides Allah. 26 And Noah 
said: My Lord, do not leave any of the disbelievers dwelling in the 
land. c 27 For if You leave them, they will lead astray Your ser- 
vants, and will not produce any offspring but immoral, ungrateful 
ones. 28 My Lord, forgive me and my parents and him who enters 
my house believing, and the believing men and the believing 
women. And increase the wrongdoers in nothing but destruction! 



a (23) The names of the idols given here are those which existed in Arabia in 
the Prophet's time. The Quran, while relating the histories of previous prophets, 
often introduces the Prophet's own history, as is the case here. Even if these 
verses are taken as referring to Noah, no difficulty arises because there is reason 
to believe that the Arabs obtained most of their idols from foreign countries. The 
commentators say that Wadd was worshipped in the form of a man, Suwa ' in that 
of a woman, Yaghuth in that of a lion, Ya 'uq in that of a horse and Nasr in that of 
an eagle. 

b (24) They only went on adding wrongs to their wrongs, hence the prayer of 
the messenger to increase them in nothing but ruin. In fact, they were bringing 
ruin on their heads with their own hands. 

c (26) Noah was speaking only of his own people and praying against them 
only. All his statements and prayers refer to them, and not to the whole world. 
Hence al-ard simply signifies the land in which they lived and does not refer to 
the whole earth. 



Chapter 72 
Ai-jinn The Jinn 

The title of this chapter is taken from the mention of certain believers in the 
Holy Prophet's truth called jinn. This is a prophetical reference to those people 
accepting Islam who were yet hidden from the eye, belonging to lands beyond 
Arabia as well as to future times. The chapter was revealed two years before 
the Hijra when opposition to the Holy Prophet had reached a climax and per- 
secution of Muslims was at its most severe. In such circumstances of seeming 
hopelessness, a very emphatic assurance of eventual success is given in this 
chapter. The second half of the chapter speaks of the protection granted to 
prophets against their enemies. 



Section 1 : Foreign Believers 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Say: It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn 
listened," so they said: Surely we have heard a wonderful Quran, 
2 guiding to the right way — so we believe in it. And we shall not 
set up anyone as partner with our Lord; 3 and He — exalted be the 
majesty of our Lord! — has not taken a consort, nor a son; 



a (1) The existence of jinn, or ethereal beings like the angels (the former 
being the spirits of evil and the latter the spirits of good), is a question quite 
distinct, but it is clear that the jinn spoken of here did not belong to this class; see 
6:128 footnote 1, for full explanation of the word. Jinn are also referred to in 
46:29-31, where they are made to say: "Our people, we have heard a Book 
revealed after Moses, verifying what is before it". This shows that they were Jews. 
The jinn spoken of here are evidently Christians, as v. 3 shows. 

b (3) The words of this verse are a clear indication that the persons spoken of 
here are Christians. That both Jews and Christians living outside Arabia accepted 
the message of Truth brought by the Prophet is a fact. But from what is stated 
further on, it appears that the reference here is to Christian nations of the distant 
future who will accept the truth of the message brought by the Prophet. At any 
rate the prophetical in these words, whether relating to the near or distant future, 
is clearly hinted at in the opening words of the chapter — It has been revealed to 
me that a group of the jinn listened. 



728 



72 : 4 • FOREIGN BELIEVERS 729 

4 and the foolish among us used to forge extravagant lies against 
Allah; 5 and we thought that the people and the jinn did not utter a 
lie against Allah; 6 and men from among the people used to seek 
refuge with men from among the jinn, so they increased them in 
evil doing; " 7 and they thought, as you think, that Allah would not 
raise anyone; 8 and we sought to reach heaven, but we found it 
filled with strong guards and flames; 'and we used to sit in some 
of its sitting-places to steal a hearing. But he who tries to listen 
now finds a flame lying in wait for him; 10 and we do not know 
whether evil is meant for those on earth or whether their Lord 
means to direct them aright; c n and some of us are good and 
others of us are below that — we are sects following different ways; 
12 and we know that we cannot escape Allah in the earth, nor can 
we escape Him by flight; 13 and when we heard the guidance, we 
believed in it. So whoever believes in his Lord, he fears neither 
loss nor injustice; 14 and some of us are those who submit, and 
others of us are deviators. So whoever submits, these aim at the 
right way. 

15 And as to the deviators, they are fuel of hell; 16 and if they 
keep to the (right) way, We would certainly give them to drink 
abundant water/ 17 so that We may try them by (means of) it. And 
whoever turns away from the reminder of his Lord, He will make 
him enter into an afflicting punishment; 18 and the mosques are 
Allah's, so do not call upon anyone with Allah; 19 and when the 
Servant of Allah stood up praying to Him, they nearly crowded 
him (to death). 6 



a (6) The jinn and the people (Arabic: ins) of this verse are undoubtedly the 
leaders of evil and the weaker ones in intellect who followed them blindly. 

b (8) By reaching heaven is meant learning secrets of the heaven. The 
reference may be to the diviners and astrologers among them, for which see 37:7- 
10, but more likely it is a prophetical reference to the great scientific discoveries 
of the modern age relating to heaven. 

c (10) These words seem to refer to the great tribulations which are meant to 
direct man's attention to spiritual truth. 

d (16) Abundance of wealth may be meant by abundance of water. 

e (19) The servant of Allah is the Holy Prophet Muhammad.

Section 2: Protection of Revelation 

20 Say: I only call upon my Lord, and I do not set up any 
partner with Him. 21 Say: I do not control evil nor good for you. 
22 Say: None can protect me against Allah, nor can I find any 
refuge besides Him; 23 (my duty is) but to deliver (the command) 
of Allah and His messages. And whoever disobeys Allah and His 
Messenger, surely for him is the Fire of hell, to abide in it for a 
long time, 24 till when they see what they are promised, they will 
know who is weaker in helpers and smaller in numbers. 

25 Say: I do not know whether what you are promised is near 
or if my Lord will appoint for it a distant term. 26 The Knower of 
the unseen, so He makes His secrets known to none, 27 except a 
messenger whom He chooses. For surely He makes a guard to go 
before him and behind him, 28 that He may know that they have 
truly delivered the messages of their Lord; and He encompasses 
whatever is with them, and He keeps account of all things.' 



a (24) As a human being left to himself without a friend, without helper, 
rejected at home and elsewhere (as he was rejected at Ta'if at this time), the Holy 
Prophet had thus poured out his heart, in this state of utter helplessness: "O Lord, 
I make my complaint to You of my helplessness and frailty and of my insignifi- 
cance before mankind...". Now contrast with it the revelation which he received 
just then, which speaks of the opponents of Truth who would soon be brought low 
— "they will know who is weaker in helpers and smaller in numbers". The source 
of the Holy Prophet's revelation was other than his own heart, for the same heart 
could not simultaneously vent feelings of utter helplessness and weakness and 
those of unbounded confidence in his ultimate triumph. 

b (27) That the overthrow of opposition to the great message of Truth was 
certain is stated in v. 24. Then v. 25 states that the Prophet did not know whether 
this overthrow would come soon or in the distant future, but Truth must triumph. 
And the law is stated now that God makes known His will, the unseen, the Truth, 
by His messenger, to convey that Truth to other people. It is God's message and it 
must be delivered in spite of all opposition. The Divine purpose is accomplished 
by sending a guard, before and after the messenger, to protect him against all on- 
slaughts, as is made clear in the words that follow. 

c (28) Note the firm tone of these revelations under the disheartening circum- 
stances to which attention has been drawn in v. 24 footnote. Such words could not 
proceed from any but a Divine source — the message must be delivered, Allah 
encompasses all, nothing is out of His reach. 



Chapter 73 

Al-Muzzammil 

The one covering himself up 

This chapter receives its title from the Holy Prophet's description in the first 
verse as one who had covered himself up, which signifies one who has pre- 
pared himself for prayer. The previous chapter promises protection to the 
Holy Prophet and here he is told to seek that protection through prayer. The 
chapter begins by telling the Holy Prophet to pass the night in prayer, and it 
ends with a general command to all believers always to be mindful of prayer. 
In between, the Holy Prophet is told to bear patiently the ill-treatment by his 
enemies, who would soon receive their punishment as did Pharaoh when he 
wanted to destroy Moses. The revelation of this chapter belongs to the early 
period at Makkah. The reference to fighting in v. 20 does not make that verse 
a later revelation, as that reference is prophetical. 



Section 1 : The Prophet enjoined to pray 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O you covering yourself up!" 2 Rise to pray by night except 
a little, %alf of it, or lessen it a little, 4 or add to it, and recite the 
Quran (distinctly) at a leisurely pace. 5 Surely We shall charge you 
with a weighty word.* 6 The rising (to pray) by night is surely the 



a (1) The ordinary explanation is that, on receiving the Call, his first revela- 
tion, the Holy Prophet came back home trembling and said to his wife: Cover me, 
cover me. But various other explanations are given and some take it as an allusion 
to his preparation for prayers. The Prophet's own words, as recorded in Bukhari 
(1:1), make it clear that the reference here is to his covering himself up on 
receiving the first revelation. He is in fact told that he should not fear or tremble 
on account of the tremendous responsibility placed on him of reforming humanity, 
but should seek the help of God, through prayer to Him, the most effective prayer 
being prayer in the night, when the world is asleep. 

b (5) Being burdened with the guidance of the whole world was indeed a 
weighty word, the weightiest word with which any human being has been charged 
in the whole history of humanity.

firmest way to tread and most effective in speech." 7 Truly you 
have by day prolonged occupation. 

8 And remember the name of jour Lord and devote yourself 
to Him with (complete) devotion. 9 The Lord of the East and the 
West — there is no god but He — so take Him for Protector. 
10 And bear patiently what they say and turn away from them with a 
dignified withdrawal. n And leave Me and the deniers, possessors 
of plenty, and give them respite for a little while. 12 Surely 
with Us are heavy fetters and a flaming Fire, 13 and food that 
chokes and a painful punishment. 14 On the day when the earth and 
the mountains quake and the mountains become (as) heaps of sand 
let loose.* 

15 Surely We have sent to you a Messenger, a witness against 
you, as We sent a messenger to Pharaoh. c 16 But Pharaoh dis- 
obeyed the messenger, so We seized him with a violent grip. 
17 How, then, if you disbelieve, will you guard yourselves on the 
day which will make children grey-headed, 18 the heaven being 
torn apart thereby? His promise is ever fulfilled. 19 Surely this 



a (6) The praying at night is here described as being, firstly, the firmest way 
to tread — to tread the way of life, to tread upon all evil inclinations — and, 
secondly, the most effective in speech — what one says to other people becomes 
most effective. The speaker, the inviter to Truth, has his heart strengthened with 
force Divine through his lengthened devotions in the still of the night, and his 
word therefore carries the Divine force with it and enters the hearts of those who 
listen to him. Thus was the Prophet fortified doubly, in his deeds as well as in his 
words, to carry his message to other people, and thus should his true followers try 
to get strength from the same Divine source in the dead of night. The Divine light 
in its full brilliance then illumines the heart of man which reflects that light and 
illumines the world. 

b (14) Verses 12-14 speak of the wretched condition in which the present 
possessors of ease and plenty would find themselves, and how the great obstacles 
to the spread of truth would be removed before the advance of Truth; see 20:105. 

c (15) The Holy Prophet's likeness to Moses is stated in the clearest terms in 
this, one of the earliest revelations, and thus the Holy Prophet's claim to be the 
promised prophet of Deuteronomy 18:18, who is expressly stated to be the "like" 
of Moses, is as old as his revelation. 

d (18) The description in verses 17-18 is applicable to both the day of 
Resurrection and the doom of the opponents in this life. Such phrases as the

is a Reminder; so whoever wishes may take a way to his Lord. 

Section 2: Prayer enjoined on Muslims 

20 Four Lord knows indeed that you pass in prayer nearly 
two-thirds of the night, and (sometimes) half of it, and (some- 
times) a third of it, as do a group of those with you. And Allah 
measures the night and the day. He knows that (all of) you are not 
able to do it, so He has turned to you (mercifully); so read of the 
Quran whatever is easy for you. a He knows that there are sick 
among you, and others who travel in the land seeking of Allah's 
bounty, and others who fight in Allah's way. So read as much of 
it as is easy (for you), and keep up prayer and give the due charity 
and offer to Allah a goodly gift. And whatever of good you send 
on beforehand for yourselves, you will find it with Allah — that is 
best and greatest in reward. And ask forgiveness of Allah. Surely 
Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 



rolling up of heaven (21:104), the heaven being torn apart (as here and in 82:1), 
the removing of the covering of heaven (81:11), and other similar phrases, all 
really speak of the sweeping away of the old order of things to give place to a 
new, attended by the necessary terrors and disasters, and hence the description 
applies to the doom of a nation in this world as well as to the entirely new order of 
things which will be ushered in with the Resurrection. 

a (20-1) The Holy Prophet and those with him passed sometimes two-thirds, 
sometimes a half, and sometimes a third of the night in prayer. All Muslims could 
not follow their example, and hence they are told that they might pray by night so 
long as it was easy to them and not a burden. By the reading of the Quran is here 
meant its recital in the night-prayer called tahajjud. 

b (20-2) The mention here of fighting is very probably a prophetical state- 
ment, as we find in many other places in the Quran; hence the occurrence of the 
word is no argument that the verse was not revealed at Makkah. 



Chapter 74 

A l-Muddath thir 

The one wrapping himself up 

This chapter is the second in the order of revelation. A period of about six 
months had elapsed since the first revelation (96: 1-5), and this interruption in 
revelation weighed heavily on the Holy Prophet. When the angel of the Lord 
appeared to him again, the Holy Prophet sought to wrap himself up in clothes, 
hence the title of this chapter. He is told not to seek seclusion but to arise and 
warn a people sunk low in evil. 



Section 1: The Prophet enjoined to warn 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O you who wrap yourself up! " 2 Arise and warn, 3 and your 
Lord do magnify, 4 and your garments do purify, c 5 and unclean- 
ness do shun, 6 and do no favour seeking gain/ 7 and for the sake 
of your Lord, be patient. 

8 For when the trumpet is sounded, 9 that will be — that day 
— a difficult day, 10 for the disbelievers, anything but easy. 
1 'Leave Me alone with him whom I created, 12 and gave him vast 
riches, 13 and sons dwelling in his presence, 14 and made matters 



a (1) Some take the word muddaththir metaphorically, the meaning being 
one clad in the garments ofprophethood. 

b (2) In the last chapter, the Prophet is commanded to engage himself in 
devotion so that he should attain to perfection; here he is commanded to convey 
the message and to warn, to make others perfect. 

c (4) Purification of the garments does not relate only to the outward act of 
purification, but also to the purification of the heart, as is shown in the next verse, 
which contains a command to shun every kind of uncleanness. 

d (6) The reference is in particular to the great favour which the Holy 
Prophet did to others by warning them and guiding them to the right way. But the 
words are general; even when conferring a worldly benefit on another, there should 
be no intention to receive any return for it.

easy for him, 15 and yet he desires that I should give more! 16 By no 
means! Surely he is hostile to Our messages. 17 I will make a dis- 
tressing punishment overtake him. 18 Surely he reflected and deter- 
mined, 19 but may he be destroyed how he determined! 20 Again, 
may he be destroyed how he determined! 21 Then he looked, 22 then 
frowned and scowled, 23 then turned back and was big with pride, 
24 then said: This is nothing but magic from of old, 25 this is nothing 
but the word of a mortal! 

26 I will cast him into hell. 27 And what will make you realize 
what hell is? 28 It leaves nothing, and spares nothing. 29 It scorches 
the mortal. 30 Over it are nineteen." 31 And We have made none but 
angels (to be) wardens of the Fire, and We have made their num- 
ber only as a trial for those who disbelieve, that those who have 
been given the Book may be certain and those who believe may 
increase in faith, and those who have been given the Book and the 
believers may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts is a 
disease and the disbelievers may say: What does Allah mean by 
this parable? Thus Allah leaves in error whom He pleases, and 
guides whom He pleases. And none knows the forces of your Lord 
but He. And this is nothing but a Reminder to mortals. 

Section 2: The Warning 

32 Indeed, by the moon! 33 And the night when it departs! 
34 And the dawn when it shines! 35 Surely it is one of the gravest 
(misfortunes), 36 a warning to mortals, 37 to him among you who 
will go forward or will remain behind.* 38 Every soul is held in 



a (30) This is called a parable in the next verse: what does Allah mean by 
this parable? All that the Quran says is that over it are nineteen. The commen- 
tators think that nineteen angels, or nineteen classes, or nineteen ranks may be 
meant. The particular number is considered to be due to the misuse of nineteen 
faculties which are enumerated by the commentators. 

b (37) The light of Truth would shine forth, we are told in these verses (32- 
40), but not without a grave misfortune to those who refuse to go forward, and 
this is a warning. Those who go forward, on the other hand, will not be affected 
by that, the gravest of misfortunes, for the people of the right hand will be in Gar- 
dens, every soul being pledged for what it earns. The prophetical strain adopted 
here regarding the doom of the opponents is continued to the end of the chapter. 



736 74. THE ONE WRAPPING HIMSELF UP • 74 : 39 

pledge for what it earns, 39 except the people of the right hand. 40 In 
Gardens, they ask one another, 41 about the guilty: 42 What has 
brought you into hell? 43 They will say: We were not from among 
those who prayed, 44 nor did we feed the poor," 45 and we indulged 
in idle talk with idle talkers, 46 and we called the day of Judgment a 
lie, 47 till the inevitable caught up with us. 48 So the intercession 
of intercessors will not avail them. 

49 What is then the matter with them, that they turn away 
from the Reminder, 50 as if they were frightened donkeys, 51 fleeing 
from a lion? 52 No, everyone of them desires that he should be 
given pages spread out — 53 By no means! But they do not fear 
the Hereafter. 54 Indeed, it is surely a Reminder. 55 So whoever 
wishes may be mindful of it. 56 And they will not be mindful unless 
Allah please. c He is Worthy that duty should be kept to Him and 
Worthy to forgive. d 



a (44) Note the reply to v. 42 — What has brought you into hell? It is 
neglect of two chief duties: we did not pray and we did not feed the poor. These 
are thus the two pillars of faith, service of God and service of humanity. 

b (52) Everyone of them would have a revelation granted to him direct from 
heaven. This they said repeatedly: Why does not Allah speak to us? (2:11 8). 

c (56-1) In the Quran God does not compel people to adopt one way or 
another. He points out the right course from the wrong and leaves it to the choice 
of the individual: So whoever wishes may be mindful of it (v. 55); We have truly 
shown him the way; he may be thankful or unthankful (76:3). Similar verses 
abound in the Quran. The statement, and they will not be mindful unless Allah 
please, means that Allah is pleased to guide those in the right way and to make 
those mindful who open their hearts to receive it. Note how clearly the verses 
preceding it depict the condition of those who do not even listen to the Reminder: 
What is then the matter with them, that they turn away from the Reminder, as if 
they were frightened donkeys, fleeing from a lion? (verses 49-51). See also 76:30. 

d (56-2) God is Worthy that duty of Him should be observed and therefore 
whoever fails to observe that duty must suffer. But God is not a hard taskmaster; 
if man fails to observe his duty, God in His unbounded love comes to his help and 
covers his faults with His vast forgiveness. The epithet here used — Worthy to 
forgive — indicates that forgiveness is in His nature; even if man does not ask for 
forgiveness, He forgives. 



Chapter 75 
Ai-Qiyamah The Resurrection 

This chapter is entitled The Resurrection from the occurrence of that word in 
its first verse, which puts forward the spiritual resurrection as evidence of the 
great Resurrection. The self-accusing spirit of v. 2 is the first stage in man's 
spiritual resurrection, the stage at which the inner self of man asserts itself 
when he does evil. At this stage the human in man becomes stronger than the 
animal. This chapter, dealing with the subject of the resurrection, is a very 
early revelation. 



Section 1 : The Truth of the Resurrection 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 No, I swear by the day of Resurrection!" 2 No, I swear by the 
self-accusing spirit! * 3 Does man think that We shall not gather his 
bones? e 4 Indeed, We are Powerful to make complete his whole 
make. 5 But man desires to go on doing evil in front of him. 6 He 
asks: When is the day of Resurrection? 7 So when the sight is con- 
fused, 6 8 and the moon becomes dark, 9 and the sun and the moon 
are brought together — 10 man will say on that day: Where to flee? 



a (1) By the resurrection is here meant the spiritual resurrection of the Arabs, 
to be brought about through the Prophet. The primary significance of qiyamah is 
only rising, the rising of a man all at once. Al-qiyamah is now a term which is 
synonymous with the great Resurrection, but it has not lost its original signifi- 
cance, and means also the rising to life of those who are spiritually dead. The la 
("no") in the beginning of v. 1 and v. 2 is used to give emphasis to the oath. 

b (2) For the "self-accusing spirit" see the introductory note above. 

c (3) The gathering of the bones stands for a new life. 

d (4) God, Who made a complete man out of nothing, we are here told, has 
also the power to give life to bones or to raise him a second time. 

e (7) Some great calamity is implied which would perplex the opponents. 
Some commentators take these to be the signs of the approach of the death of a 
person. 

/(9) This implies the disappearance of the light of both. 



737 



738 75. THE RESURRECTION • 75 : 11 

n No! There is no refuge! 12 With your Lord on that day is the place 
of rest. 13 Man will that day be informed of what he sent on ahead 
and what he put off." 14 Indeed, man is evidence against himself, 
15 though he put up excuses. 

16 (O Prophet) Do not move your tongue therewith to make 
haste with it.* 17 Surely on Us rests the collecting of it and the 
reciting of it. c 18 So when We recite it, follow its recitation. 
19 Again on Us rests the explaining of it. 

20 No, but you love the present life, 21 and neglect the Here- 
after. 22 (Some) faces that day will be bright, 23 looking to their 
Lord. 24 And (other) faces that day will be gloomy, 25 knowing that 



a (13) What he sent on ahead implies the evil deeds which he did but ought 
not to have done; what he put off being the good deeds which he failed to do but 
which he ought to have done. 

b (16) The preceding verses speak of the distress which must befall those 
who do not forsake the wrong course. The Prophet naturally desired to make it 
clear to them, and therefore, he was anxious that the warning should be given 
immediately in plainer words. So, he is told not to make haste with it. Hence the 
statement made in the verses that follow, namely, that the recitation and collection 
of the whole of the Quran, together with its effective explanation to the oppo- 
nents, were matters which Allah had decided to bring about, and the Prophet 
should have no anxiety on that account. Compare 20:1 13-1 14. 

c (17) There can be no clearer evidence that the collection of the verses into 
chapters and of the chapters into one whole is here claimed by the Quran to be a 
matter which, like its revelation, was to be entirely carried out under Divine 
guidance by the Holy Prophet himself. The Holy Book was thus from the first 
intended to be arranged and collected into one whole. Note that if the order of 
revelation were to be followed in the arrangement of its parts, its collection would 
not have been spoken of as something distinct from its revelation, which is 
implied in the word recitation. 

d (23) As that day represents both the day of the breathing of the life spiri- 
tual here and the day of the Resurrection, the words looking to their Lord have 
also a double significance, indicating looking to the Lord for their reward in the 
former case, and, the highest bliss of all, the sight of the Lord in the Hereafter. It 
should be noted that the sight of the Lord does not imply that the Lord will have a 
body; it is not with the material eye that the Lord will be seen, but by the spiritual 
eye, which the righteous will possess on the day of Resurrection.

a great disaster will be made to befall them." 26 Indeed, when (the 
soul) comes up to the throat, 27 and it is said: Who will ascend 
(with it)? 28 and he is sure that it is the parting, 29 and affliction is 
combined with affliction — 30 to your Lord on that day is the 
driving. 

Section 2: The Dead rise 

31 So he did not accept the truth, nor did he pray, 32 but denied 
and turned back, 33 then he went to his people arrogantly/ 34 Nearer 
to you and nearer; 35 again, nearer to you and nearer (is woe)."' 
36 Does man think that he will be left aimless? 6 37 Was he not a 
small life-germ in sperm emitted? 38 Then he was a clot; so He 
created (him), then made (him) perfect. 39 Then He made of him 
two kinds, the male and the female. 40 Is not He Powerful to give 
life to the dead? f 



a (25) Note that this great disaster also befell them in this life, and thus it 
demonstrated the truth of the Hereafter. 

b (27) Will the angels of mercy ascend with it or the angels of punishment? 

c (33) The description applies to every opponent. 

d (35) The haughty opponent is warned that destruction is very near. The 
repetition shows that the opponents were threatened with a double punishment, 
namely, in this life and in the Hereafter. In fact, the double punishment is spoken 
of throughout the chapter. 

e (36) The verse draws attention to the seriousness of life and to man's res- 
ponsibility for his actions — a doctrine denied as much today as it was by the 
Arabs. 

/(40) The giving of "life to the dead" not only signifies raising after death, 
but also spiritually raising a dead people to life. 



Chapter 76 

Al-Insan Mail 

This chapter, entitled Man from the occurrence of this word in the first verse, 
deals with man's attainment to perfection. It shows that in the attainment of 
this perfection there are two stages: the suppression of all evil tendencies and 
the gaining of strength to perform great deeds of sacrifice. Towards the end, 
the chapter says that if those addressed by the Holy Prophet do not accept his 
message, Allah will cause another people to take their place, for the Quran 
must accomplish its object of enabling man to attain to perfection. Its revela- 
tion belongs to a very early period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Attainment of Perfection 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Surely there came over man a time when he was nothing that 
could be mentioned. 2 Surely We have created man from sperm 
mixed (with ovum), to try him, so We have made him hearing, 
seeing. 3 We have truly shown him the way; he may be thankful or 
unthankful. 4 Surely We have prepared for the disbelievers chains 
and shackles and a burning Fire.* 

5 The righteous truly drink of a cup tempered with camphor c 



a (3) The right way is shown clearly; it is for man himself to walk in it and 
thus be thankful, or away from it and thus be unthankful. Or the meaning may be 
he may accept or reject. 

b (4) See 69:32 footnote. 

c (5) The original for camphor is kajur, which is derived from kafr meaning 
to cover or to suppress. Medically camphor is a cool and refreshing aromatic, but 
here it is used in reference to its original significance. The cup of which the right- 
eous drink is the cup of the love of Allah, and its mixture with kafur is to indicate 
that by this cup all low desires and sexual passions which lead man away from the 
path of righteousness are suppressed, in the same manner as poisonous matter is 
suppressed by camphor. Man needs an intoxication and for it he generally resorts 
to alcoholic drinks, which bring in their train evil and slavery to sexual passions. 
The Prophet intoxicated his followers with the love of Allah, and as a result of 



740 



76 : 6 • ATTAINMENT OF PERFECTION 741 

— 6 a fountain from which the servants of Allah drink, making it 
flow in abundance/ 7 They fulfil (their) vows and fear a day, the 
evil of which is widespread. 8 And they give food, out of love for 
Him, to the poor and the orphan and the captive. 'We feed you, for 
Allah's pleasure only — we desire from you neither reward nor 
thanks. 4 10 Surely we fear from our Lord a stern, distressful day. 

11 So Allah will guard them from the evil of that day, and 
cause them to meet with splendour and happiness; 12 and reward 
them, for their steadfastness, with a Garden and with silk, 13 reclin- 
ing in it on raised couches; they will see therein neither (excessive 
heat of) sun nor intense cold. 14 And close down upon them are its 
shadows, and its fruits are made near (to them), easy to reach. 
15 And round about them are made to go vessels of silver and 
goblets of glass, 16 crystal-clear, made of silver — they have 
measured them according to a measured 17 And they are made to 
drink therein a cup tempered with ginger — 18 (of) a fountain in it 

this, their evil tendencies were altogether suppressed. Verses 7 and 8 show clearly 
that it is of the change brought about in this very life that the Quran is speaking 
here. In the spiritual advancement of man this is the first stage, because it is not 
until the evil tendencies of man are completely suppressed that he is able to 
advance to the higher stages of spiritual perfection. 

a (6) lbs fountain from which the servants of Allah drink is the fountain of 
the love of God referred to in the previous verse. It is not a cup which may be 
exhausted with one draught; it is a fountain. The faithful are here spoken of as the 
servants of Allah — 'ibad Allah — because an 'abd (singular of 'ibad) is really 
one who is entirely lost in the love of God. But here we are further told that they 
not only drink of it themselves but they make it to flow forth in such abundance 
that others also may partake of it. 

b (9) The fulfilment of vows spoken of in v. 7 is in relation to the service of 
God, or the act of bringing themselves closer and closer to God, while the feeding 
of the poor spoken of in verses 8 and 9 is in relation to the service of humanity. 
Thus they combine the service of God with the service of humanity. The words 
for Allah 's pleasure clearly show that it is of the love of God that these verses 
speak. Man worships Allah for the love of Allah, but the Quran requires him to 
serve humanity also for the love of Allah. 

c (16) That is, everyone will receive them according to the measure of his 
deeds. 

d (17) The Arabic word for ginger is zanjabll. It is said to have a property 
that is heating or warming, strengthening and exhilarating. The first cup of the 



742 76. THE MAN • 76 : 19 

called Salsabll." 19 And round about them will go youths, never 
altering in age;' when you see them you will think them to be 
scattered pearls. 20 And when you look there, you see blessings and 
a great kingdom. e 21 On them are garments of fine green silk and 
thick brocade, and they are adorned with bracelets of silver, and 
their Lord makes them to drink a pure drink.'' 22 Surely this is a 
reward for you, and your striving is recompensed. 

Section 2: Another Generation will be raised up 

23 Surely We have revealed the Quran to you, in portions. 
24 So wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord, e and do not obey 
a sinner or an ungrateful one among them. 25 And glorify the name 
of your Lord morning and evening. 26 And during part of the night 
adore Him, and glorify Him throughout a long night. 

27 Surely these (people) love the transitory life and neglect a 
grievous day before them. 28 We created them and made firm their 
make, and, when We will, We can bring in their place others like 



love of God is spoken of in v. 5, as being tempered with camphor and bringing 
about suppression of evil, and this second cup is now spoken of as strengthening 
and exhilarating, i.e., enabling man to perform great and noble deeds. The love of 
God thus not only suppresses the evil inclinations of man, but also enables him to 
attain a still higher stage of spiritual advancement, giving him the strength to per- 
form wonderful deeds of self-sacrifice. 

a (18) SalsabTl means easy, sweet, rapid-flowing. According to some it is 
made up of sal, meaning ask, and sabil, way, as if it meant, Ask your Lord a way 
to it. 

b (19) Because these are heavenly blessings, and decay cannot overtake them; 
see 56:17. 

c (20) The word thamma meaning there or thither is used here in reference 
to the spiritual kingdom which is granted to the faithful. They are granted bless- 
ings and a great kingdom in this life as well, to which man shuts his eyes on 
account of his ignorance. 

rf(21) As they led pure lives here, they were made to drink a pure drink in 
this very life. They will have a pure drink in the Hereafter, too, the heavenly life 
being the purest that can be imagined. 

e (24) This shows that the blessings mentioned in the previous section will 
also find a manifestation in this life; the Divine judgment will bring about the fall 
of one party and the rise of another. 



76 : 29 • ANOTHER GENERATION WILL BE RAISED UP 743 

them by change. 29 Surely this is a Reminder; so whoever wishes, 
let him take a way to his Lord. 30 And you do not (so) wish, unless 
Allah please.* Surely Allah is ever Knowing, Wise. 31 He admits 
whom He pleases to His mercy; and the wrongdoers — He has 
prepared for them a painful punishment. 



a (28) The mention of the grievous day in the previous verse and the state- 
ment here that another people will take the place of these are clear prophecies for 
this life. Hence it is called a warning in the verse that follows. 

b (30) The faithful may be spoken of here; v. 29 states that whoever wishes, 
let him take a way to his Lord, and v. 3 1 refers to the faithful in the words, He 
admits whom He pleases to His mercy. The meaning is that true and sincere 
believers have so completely submitted themselves to the Divine will and are so 
completely resigned that all their wishes and desires are in accordance with Allah's 
pleasure (the words conveying: you do not wish but what Allah pleases). 

Taking the words as a general statement, note that the chapter opens with the 
clear statement in v. 3, We have truly shown him the way; he may be thankful or 
unthankful; so that man has not been constrained by God to adopt a particular 
course, whether for good or for evil. The end of the chapter is equally clear: 
Surely this is a Reminder; so whoever wishes, let him take a way to his Lord. The 
words — you do not wish, unless Allah please — therefore mean that man's 
choice would have no effect, if it did not please Allah. There are two things nece- 
ssary for the guidance of man: firstly, the revelation of the Reminder by Allah, 
and secondly, the acceptance of that Reminder by man. If Allah had not pleased to 
reveal the Reminder, man's choice would have been nowhere. 



Chapter 77 
Ai-Mursaiat Those Sent Forth 

This chapter is a supplement to the previous, for while it is shown there how 
the righteous attain to perfection, here the fate of the rejectors is made clear. 
Those sent forth are the Divine messengers, the rejection of whose message 
brings evil consequences, and that word (mursalat), occurring in the first verse, 
gives its name to this chapter. The fourth year of the Holy Prophet's mission 
is regarded as the probable date of the revelation of this chapter. 



Section 1: Consequences of Rejection 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By those sent forth to spread goodness! 2 Then those driving 
off the chaff! 3 And those spreading (goodness), far and wide! 
4 Then those making a distinction! 5 Then those offering the 
Reminder, 6 to clear or to warn! — 7 Surely what you are promised 
will come to pass." 

8 So when the stars are made to disappear, 9 and when the 
heaven is torn apart, 10 and when the mountains are carried away as 
dust, n and when the messengers are made to reach their appointed 



a (7) As stated in 37:1 footnote, attention is drawn in what are called oaths to 
certain indisputable facts, which lead to a conclusion. The conclusion here is that 
the opponents are doomed (v. 12). The characteristics described in the first six 
verses apply to prophets whose opponents were destroyed. This is made clear by 
the mention of the appointed time of the messengers in v. 1 1, by which, of course, 
is meant the appointed time of the destruction of the enemies of Truth. They are 
told to consider how Truth was spread by former prophets. In v. 1 they are spoken 
of as being sent with goodness; in v. 2, as driving off the chaff of falsehood before 
them; in v. 3, as scattering the seed of goodness far and wide or giving life to dead 
earth; in v. 4, as ultimately bringing about a distinction between truth and false- 
hood, and in v. 5 and 6 as giving the Reminder that one party may be cleared and 
the other warned. These considerations about the former prophets should lead the 
opponents to the certain conclusion that the same Divine law was working in the 
case of the Holy Prophet, and their doom was also certain.

time," 12 to what day is the doom fixed? 13 To the day of Decision. 
14 And what will make you comprehend what the day of Decision 
is? 15 Woe on that day to the rejectors! 16 Did We not destroy the 
former generations? 17 Then We followed them up with later ones. 
18 Thus do We deal with the guilty. 19 Woe on that day to the 
rejectors! 

20 Did We not create you from a worthless seeming water? 
21 Then We placed it in a secure resting-place, 22 till an appointed 
term, 23 so We determined — how well are We at determining! 
24 Woe on that day to the rejectors! 25 Have We not made the earth 
draw to itself 26 the living and the dead/ 27 and made in it lofty 
mountains, and given you to drink sweet water? 28 Woe on that day 
to the rejectors! 

29 Walk on to that which you called a lie. 30 Walk on to the 
shadow, having three branches/ 31 neither cool, nor availing against 
the flame. 32 It sends up sparks like palaces, 33 as if they were yellow 
camels. 6 34 Woe on that day to the rejectors! 35 This is the day on 



a (11) The disappearance of the stars (v. 8) was a sign for the Arabs of the 
befalling of a calamity. The tearing apart of the heaven (v. 9) indicated the same, 
because the heaven was considered a protection. Compare 21:32: And We have 
made the heaven a guarded canopy; see 73:18 footnote. The passing away of the 
mountains (v. 10) signified the disappearance from among them of their great 
men, whose protection they sought in time of distress. All these things would be 
brought about when came the appointed time of the messengers, i.e., the time of 
the destruction of their opponents. 

b (19) Note the clear words of verses 16-19. The former generations were 
destroyed because of their wickedness and others were brought up in their place; 
such will always be the fate of the guilty — the day of their doom is the day of 
Decision. A complete manifestation of that day is, however, reserved for the 
Hereafter. 

c (26) This refers to the law of gravitation. It further shows that the belief 
relating to the ascent of Jesus to the fourth heaven is erroneous. 

d (30) The word zill, translated here as "shadow", is extensively used to 
carry a number of other significances, such as covering, protection, a plentiful or 
an easy state of life. The three branches of it are the three characteristics thereof 
stated in the verses that follow; see the next footnote. 

e (33) They reject the Truth and seek comfort and ease in material benefits. 



746 77. THOSE SENT FORTH • 77 : 36 

which they do not speak, 36 nor are they allowed to offer excuses. 
37 Woe on that day to the rejectors! 38 This is the day of Decision; 
We have gathered you and the ancients." 39 So if you have a plan, 
plan against me (now).* 40 Woe on that day to the rejectors! 

Section 2: Consequences of Rejection 

41 Surely the dutiful are amid shades and fountains, 42 and fruits 
such as they desire. 43 Eat and drink pleasantly for what you did. 
44 Thus do We reward the doers of good. 45 Woe on that day to the 
rejectors! 46 Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while; surely you 
are guilty. 47 Woe on that day to the rejectors! 48 And when it is said 
to them, Bow down (before Allah), they do not bow down. 49 Woe 
on that day to the rejectors! 50 In what announcement after this will 
they then believe? 



They are given a shade, but it does not serve the purpose of shade. It is devoid of 
the coolness of shade — they cannot find solace in it. Nor does it avail them 
against flames, which stand here for the distresses of life. More than this, what 
they mistook for ease and plenty is itself a source of distress. Sparks arise there- 
from, sparks as big as palaces. In fact, the very palaces which they make for their 
comfort turn into sparks, which set fire to all around them. Perhaps there is a 
deeper reference here to the modern implements of destruction on account of their 
magnitude and extensive destructive effect. These sparks are further compared to 
yellow camels, which is true not only as regards their colour but also because of 
the succession with which these big sparks follow one another, like camels walk- 
ing one after another in a line. 

a (38) This gathering together will take place in the Resurrection, but the 
opponents of Truth, earlier as well as later, are gathered together in punishment in 
this life, too. 

b (39) The opponents are even so early challenged to execute their plans 
against the Holy Prophet. 



Chapter 78 
Ai-Naba' The Announcement 

This chapter is entitled Al-Naba ' or the Announcement, from the mention in 
v. 2 of the tremendous or very great announcement. It announces to humanity 
that God will give life to a dead earth through the Holy Prophet. It speaks 
also of the day of Decision to show that Truth will ultimately triumph over 
opposition to it. Its revelation belongs to the early period at Makkah. 



u» 



Section 1 : The Day of Decision 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 



1 About what do they ask one another? 2 About the tremendous 
announcement Concerning which they differ." 4 No, they will soon 
o know; 5 no, again, they will soon know. 6 Have We not made the 
earth an expanse 7 and the mountains as pegs? 8 And We have 
created you in pairs, 9 and made your sleep for rest, 10 and made the 
night a covering, n and made the day for seeking livelihood. 12 And 
We have made above you seven strong (bodies), 13 and made a 
shining lamp,* 14 and We send down from the clouds water pouring 
forth in abundance, 15 that We may bring forth with it grain and 
vegetation, 16 and luxuriant gardens. 



a (3) Some commentators take the "tremendous announcement" to signify 
the Quran, others the prophethood of Muhammad and still others the day of 
Resurrection. In fact, all three are included. The Quran was revealed as the 
greatest of the Divine messages hitherto given to humanity, because it was a 
message for the whole of humanity, compared with the smaller messages to this 
or that nation. It was, moreover, the most complete message. It gave the great 
news that the whole of humanity would receive life through it. They differed 
about it not only in the sense that they rejected it, but also because they put in 
different suggestions, some saying that the Prophet was a madman, others that he 
was a dreamer, others still that he was a poet or a fabricator, and so on. 

b (13) The seven strong bodies of v. 12 are apparently the seven major planets 
of the solar system, the words above you clearly showing that the earth itself 
belongs to the same class, and the sun, the centre of the solar system, is spoken of 
in the words a shining lamp.

17 Surely the day of Decision is appointed a — 18 the day 
when the trumpet is blown, so you come forth in companies, 19 and 
the heaven is opened so it becomes as doors, 20 and the mountains 
are moved off, so they remain a (mere) semblance.* 21 Surely hell 
lies in wait, 22 a destination for the inordinate, 23 living in it for long 
years. e 24 They do not taste therein coolness nor drink, 25 but boil- 
ing and intensely cold water, 26 a recompense corresponding."' 
27 Surely they did not fear the reckoning, 28 and rejected Our mess- 
ages, denying (them). 29 And We have recorded everything in a book, 
30 so taste, for We shall add to you nothing but punishment. 6 

Section 2: The Day of Decision 

31 Surely for those who keep their duty is achievement/ 
32 gardens and vineyards, 33 and youthful (companions), equals in 
age/ 34 and a pure cup. 35 They do not hear therein vain words 



a (17) That there is a day of Decision in this life too, which is synonymous 
with the ultimate triumph of Truth and the doom of opposition to its spread, is 
amply clear from all these early chapters. 

b (20) The description contained in verses 1 8-20 is a prophetical description 
of the final triumph of Truth. People will come forth in companies to accept the 
Truth (see ch. 110: "when the help of Allah and victory comes and you see people 
entering the religion of Allah in companies"); the heaven is opened and the dead 
earth receives life (v. 19); the mountains — the great opposing forces — melt away, 
and all that remains of opposition is a mere semblance. 

c (23) The use of the word ahqab (long years), which signifies a limited 
period, leaves no doubt that the punishment of hell is not eternal. Such words are 
never used regarding the bliss of heavenly life, which is a clear indication that the 
latter will never come to an end, while the former shall; see 1 1 : 1 07 footnote. 

d (26) The punishment of hell is described here as a recompense correspond- 
ing to the sin. Various names are given to hell itself, and various sorts of punish- 
ment are spoken of. Thus every sinner has his own hell, corresponding to his sin. 

e (30) As they in their inordinacy added evil to evil, they shall have corres- 
pondingly punishment added to punishment. The addition in punishment lasts only 
until the evil is requited. 

/(31) The reward of good is achievement — achievement of the object of 
this life as also of the great goal of the next life. It is this achievement which 
becomes a Garden. 

g (33) It should be noted that neither the word kawa 'ib ("youthful") nor 



78 : 36 • THE DAY OF DECISION 749 

nor lying — 36 a reward from your Lord, a gift sufficient; 37 the 
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the 
Beneficent, they are not able to address Him. 38 The day when the 
Spirit and the angels stand in ranks;" none shall speak except he 
whom the Beneficent permits and he speaks aright. 39 That is the 
True Day, so whoever wishes may take refuge with his Lord. 
40 Truly We warn you of a punishment near at hand ' — the day 
when man will see what (deeds) his hands have sent ahead, and 
the disbeliever will say: I wish I were dust! 



atrdb ("equals in age") is preceded or followed by any qualifying words. Hence 
kawa'ib only means showing freshness of youth. For "equals in age" see 38:52 
footnote. For further explanation see 52:20 footnote. 

a (38) The word al-riih, translated as the Spirit, really signifies Divine inspi- 
ration or Divine revelation. See 40:15, 70:4 and footnotes there. Gabriel is called 
al-riih because he brings the Divine revelation to the Prophet. The human spirit 
can, in fact, be called al-riih only when it receives light through Divine inspira- 
tion. The meaning would thus be that on the day of Judgment the faithful and the 
angels stand in ranks in the presence of God. 

b (40) The punishment of which the disbelievers are warned throughout the 
chapter is a punishment near at hand, which term, like the nearer punishment of 
32:21, indicates the punishment of this life. 



Chapter 79 
Ai-Nazi'at Those Who Yearn 

This chapter is named after the word which occurs in the first verse as a 
description of the groups or parties of the faithful who were destined to bring 
about a transformation in the world. Their chief characteristics are mentioned 
in the first four verses as being those who yearned ardently after God, and who 
went forth cheerfully braving all opposition, then ran swiftly in the cause of 
Truth, and went ahead of all such communities who had a similar yearning in 
the past and regulated affairs. These verses are followed by predicting the great 
revolution which would be brought about by their exertions. It is a revelation 
of the early period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : The Great Commotion 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By those yearning vehemently! 2 And those going forth 
cheerfully! 3 And those running swiftly! 4 And those that are fore- 
most going ahead! 5 And those regulating the Affair!" 6 The day 
when the quaking one shall quake ' — 7 the consequence will 



a (5) These verses give a description of the spiritual characteristics of the 
faithful. There was a vehement yearning in the hearts of the believers for their 
Maker (v. 1), and it was this ardent desire that made them go forth in the way of 
God cheerfully in spite of the severest opposition (v. 2); they ran swiftly (v. 3), so 
that they traversed eastern and western lands in an incredibly short time; they 
were thus ahead of all those who ever carried the message of Truth to their 
fellow-man (v. 4); and lastly, they regulated the affair of the spread of Truth in the 
world (v. 5), so that the farthest east (China) and farthest west (Morocco and 
Spain) were lit with the light of Islam within a hundred years. Compare 32:5. 
Taking the words in a general sense, they indicate the various stages through which 
an affair is brought to a successful issue. The first stage is that of an ardent desire 
or yearning for it; the second is that of going forth cheerfully to accomplish it; the 
third is that of running swiftly for its accomplishment; the fourth is that of going 
ahead of others; and the fifth that of regulating it in the best possible way. 

b (6) The quaking of the earth is often spoken of as an indication of a great 
revolution. What is meant is therefore that the efforts of the faithful spoken of in 



750 



79 : 8 • THE GREAT COMMOTION 751 

follow it. a "Hearts that day will palpitate, 9 their eyes downcast. 
10 They say: Shall we indeed be restored to (our) first state? 
n What! After we are rotten bones? 12 They say: That would then 
be a return with loss. 13 It is only a single cry, 14 when lo! they will 
be awakened. 6 

15 Has not the story of Moses come to you, 16 when his Lord 
called him in the holy valley, Tuwa? 17 Go to Pharaoh, surely he 
has rebelled. 18 And say: Will you purify yourself? 19 And I will 
guide you to your Lord so that you fear (Him). 20 So he showed 
him the mighty sign; 21 but he denied and disobeyed. 22 Then he 
went back hastily, 23 so he gathered (his people) and called out, 
24 and said: I am your Lord, the most high. 25 So Allah seized him 
with the punishment of the Hereafter and of this life. c 26 Surely in 
this there is a lesson for him who fears. 

Section 2: The Great Calamity 

27 Are you the stronger in creation or the heaven? He made it. 
28 He raised high its height, and made it perfect, 29 and He made 
dark its night and brought out its light. 30 And the earth, He cast it 
after that. e 31 He brought forth from it its water and its pasture. 



the first five verses will bring about a great commotion or a great revolution in the 
world, indicating the transformation which was to be brought about through them. 

a (7) The consequence of great commotions is the ultimate triumph of Truth. 
But the triumph of Truth is also the destruction of the opponents of Truth; hence 
the mention of palpitating hearts and downcast eyes in the next two verses. 

b (14) The spiritual awakening — the great transformation to be brought 
about by the Prophet — is spoken of here in clear words. This awakening was 
first to be brought about in Arabia and then in the whole world. 

c (25) The nature of the punishment in store for the opponents is made clear 
by citing the example of Pharaoh. 

d (28) The raising high of the height is an allusion to its extremely great height. 
There is a reference here to the great distances of the heavenly bodies, which stagger 
human imagination. 

e (30) Two things are made clear in this brief statement. ( 1 ) The earth was 
brought into existence after the heaven, or the starry creation; and (2) it was cast 
away, as a stone is cast away, from a bigger creation.

32 And the mountains, He made them firm, 33 a provision for you 
and for your cattle." 

34 So when the great Calamity comes — 35 the day when 
man remembers all that he strove for, 36 and hell is made manifest 
to him who sees. 37 Then as for him who is inordinate, 38 and pre- 
fers the life of this world, 39 hell is surely the abode. 40 And as for 
him who fears to stand before his Lord and restrains himself from 
low desires, e 41 the Garden is surely the abode. 

42 They ask you about the Hour, when will that take place, 
43 about which j^ou remind (them)? 44 To&gt;&gt;our Lord is the goal of it. rf 
45 Fou are only a warner to him who fears it. 46 0n the day when 
they see it, it will be as if they had remained (in this world) only 
for an evening or a morning. 



a (33) How the earth was made fit for living on is next made clear. Its water, 
which is the source of all its life, was brought forth from it, and water made possible 
the growth of vegetation. The mountains were raised so that they might serve as a 
provision for you and your cattle. The mountains are the sources of rivers and 
through these all living things on earth are provided with sustenance. 

b (34) By the great calamity here is generally understood only the Resurrec- 
tion, but the words of v. 25 make it clear that the reference is as much to the cala- 
mity of this life as to the Resurrection. The making of hell manifest to him who 
sees in v. 36 is a clear indication of the same; the hell of the next life is spoken of 
in v. 39. 

c (40) Refraining from low desires is the chief source from which grows a 
paradise. This further shows that the description given in the first five verses is 
really a description of the spiritual advancement of the faithful. 

d (44) The Hour is in itself a manifestation of Divine purpose. The destruc- 
tion or punishment of the disbelievers is not an end in itself. The great goal of this 
punishment is the Lord — Rabb — Who brings everything to perfection, and the 
real goal of human life is thus the Lord or the meeting with the Lord. 



Chapter 80 
'Abasa He Frowned 

Opening with a touching incident as to how a blind man interrupted the Holy 
Prophet's conversation with some of the chiefs of the Quraish, and how the 
Prophet frowned at this interruption, this chapter, to which the incident gives 
its title, really states that the poor and the humble who accepted the Truth 
would be raised to eminence, and therefore the Prophet should not be anxious 
if eminent men did not listen to his message. The chapter thus speaks of the 
greatness to which the Quran would raise its followers, and of its conquests 
in the far future. It is one of the very early revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 He frowned and turned away, 2 because the blind man came 
to him." 3 And what would make you know that he might purify 
himself, 4 or be mindful, so the Reminder should benefit him? 



a (2) A blind man came to the Holy Prophet while he was explaining the 
doctrines of Islam to an assembly of the leaders of the Quraish and, interrupting, 
asked to be taught what Allah had revealed to him. The Holy Prophet took this 
untimely interruption ill — he frowned and did not pay any attention to his ques- 
tion; on which he received this revelation. This incident shows that the source of 
the Holy Prophet's revelation was other than his own mind. It may be noted that 
the Prophet's inattention to an intruder, while he had not yet finished his conver- 
sation, was quite natural. He did not chide the intruder for his interruption, but 
only disliked it and gave him no answer. An individual would himself be the last 
person to give permanence to a reproval for his own act. Hence the source from 
which the Holy Prophet received his revelation was outside his own heart or his 
own inclinations. 

It may be noted that the chief trait of the Holy Prophet's character was his 
great regard for the poor. There are numerous incidents on record showing his 
service of the poor. He not only loved the poor from the time that he was an 
ordinary citizen to the time that he became the ruler of the whole of Arabia, but he 
himself chose to be classed among the poor in his life as well as in his death. Even 
when the wealth of Arabia lay at his feet, and his wives claimed share in that 
wealth, he showed his readiness to sacrifice every comfort, but not the honour of 
remaining a poor man.

5 As for him who considers himself free from need, 6 to him you do 
attend. 7 And no blame is on you, if he does not purify himself." 
8 And as to him who comes to you striving hard, 9 and he fears — 
10 to him you pay no regard. n No! surely it is a Reminder. 
12 So whoever wishes, let him be mindful of it. 13 In honoured books, 
14 exalted, purified, 15 in the hands of scribes, 16 noble, virtuous.* 

17 Woe to man! How ungrateful is he! 18 Of what thing did He 
create him? 19 Of a small life -germ. He creates him, then propor- 
tions him, c 20 then makes the way easy for him, 21 then He causes 
him to die, then assigns to him a grave, 22 then, when He will, He 
raises him to life again. 23 No, but he does not fulfil what He 
commands him. 24 Then let man look at his food — 25 how We pour 
down abundant water, 26 then split the earth, splitting (it) apart, 
27 then cause the grain to grow in it, 28 and grapes and clover, 29 and 
the olive and the palm, 30 and thick gardens, 31 and fruits and 
vegetation — 32 a provision for you and your cattle. 



a (7) If the Quraish leaders would not come out of the impurities of sin, the 
Prophet was not to blame for it, so that on their account he should neglect the poor 
who came to him earnestly desirous to be delivered from the bondage of sin. 

b (16) The six verses from 1 1 to 16 are really a comfort to the Holy Prophet 
for the hint contained in the first ten is that the leaders would not heed his warning 
or accept his message, and that therefore he must apply himself to the poor, who 
would be raised to eminence by the Quran. These verses tell him that the Quran is 
a tadhkirah, a reminder, a source of eminence (see also 2:152, 7:2, 38:1). Verses 
15 and 16 clearly state that the scribes of the Quran will be virtuous men, who 
will be honoured in the world. Not only was this true of men like Abu Bakr, 
Umar, Uthman and Ali, who were among the first scribes of the Holy Quran, but 
even in its later history great rulers of empires earned their livelihood by writing 
copies of the Quran. Hence the prophecy was given as a comfort to the Holy 
Prophet that he should not be grieved because the rich and the leaders did not 
accept him, for the poor who accepted him would be raised to eminence through 
the Quran. 

c (19) The word qaddara ordinarily signifies he made a thing according to a 
measure, or proportioned it, the significance being that God has allotted to man a 
certain sphere in which he can make progress. But this word sometimes carries 
the same significance as aqdara, meaning to empower or enable someone. The 
meaning in this case would be that Allah has not only created man, but he has also 
given him power and ability, so that he can make progress, if he likes.

33 But when the deafening cry comes," 34 the day when a man 
flees from his brother, 35 and his mother and his father, 36 and his 
spouse and his sons. 37 Every man of them, that day, will have con- 
cern enough to make him indifferent to others. 38 Faces on that day 
will be bright, 39 laughing, joyous. 40 And faces on that day will 
have dust on them, 41 darkness covering them.* 42 Those are the 
disbelievers, the wicked. 



a (33) The word used signifies a cry that deafens by its vehemence. Hence it 
is made to apply to the day of Resurrection; but it also means any calamity or mis- 
fortune, or a severe calamity. 

b (41) The brightness of the faces spoken of here indicates their joy; their 
being covered by darkness indicates sorrow or gloom. 



Chapter 81 
Ai-Takwir The Folding Up 

This chapter is named after the mention of the folding up of the sun in the 
first verse, which means that it will lose its light. This may refer to the end of 
things or metaphorically to the sun of the fortune of the opponents becoming 
dark. The chapter begins by speaking prophetically of certain events of the 
distant future fulfilled in the modern age. It concludes by making clear that 
the Holy Prophet's light will reach the remotest horizon and the Quran will 
reach all nations. Its revelation belongs to the very early period at Makkah. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 When the sun is folded up, a 2 and when the stars are dust- 
coloured,* 3 and when the mountains are made to pass away/ 
4 and when the camels are abandoned, 5 and when the wild animals 



a (1) For the folding up of the sun, see the introductory note above. Verses 
1-13 speak of twelve signs, some of which undoubtedly relate to this life and the 
rest may therefore also be taken as referring metaphorically to this life. The 
Resurrection of the dead in another life may often contain a deeper reference to 
the spiritual resurrection which was to be brought about by the Prophet in this 
very life, and hence the combination of the real with the metaphorical, as here. 

b (2) The darkening of the stars indicates complete darkness. Not only would 
the light of the day disappear, but even the smaller lights would become dark, and 
so the opponents of Truth would be left in utter darkness. 

c (3) The passing away of the mountains signifies the passing away of the 
greatest obstacles to the spread of Truth; see 20:105 footnote. 

d (4) 'Ishar is plural of 'ushara ', meaning a she-camel that has been ten 
months pregnant. It is applied to the she-camel until she has delivered and also 
after she has delivered, and to a camel that is milked. Such camels are 
undoubtedly the most precious, and their being abandoned may stand for the 
abandonment of camels generally. Bearing on this subject is a hadith of the 
Prophet: "Camels will be abandoned so that they will not be used for going 
swiftly (from one place to another)" (Mishkat, 26:5). This clearly refers to a time 
when swifter modes of going from one place to another will come into existence, 
so that camels will no more be needed.

81:6« THE FOLDING UP 757 

are gathered together/ 6 and when the cities are made to swell, 
7 and when people are united/ 8 and when the one buried alive is 
asked 9 for what sin she was killed, 10 and when the books are 
spread/ n and when the heaven has its covering removed, f 12 and 
when hell is kindled/ 13 and when the Garden is brought near — 



a (5) The gathering together (hashr) of wild animals seems also to be a 
prophecy relating to the distant future, when the wild animals were to be gathered 
together from all corners of the world into big towns. It may refer metaphorically 
to the gathering together of barbarous people into towns and cities. 

b (6) The word bihar is the plural of bahr, which means sea or river, as well 
as of bahrah which is synonymous with baldah or a town. The swelling of cities 
is a clear indication that advancing civilization will result in people gathering more 
and more in cities. The next verse corroborates this significance, as it speaks in 
clear words of the uniting of people. 

c (7) The uniting of people is one of the greatest achievements of modern 
civilization. The time is not far distant indeed when the whole world will be united 
and may become as a single nation. 

d (9) The reference here is to the burying alive of daughters, a practice 
common among the pre-Islamic Arabs who, either for fear of hunger or disgrace, 
buried alive their female children. The questioning refers to the future when, with 
the predominance of Islam in Arabia, this barbarous practice was to be abolished. 
But the one buried alive may stand generally for the female sex, and the reference 
here may, therefore, be to the general tyranny of the male over the female. 
(Editor 's Note: Killing of girls at birth still takes place in some parts of the world. 
Abortion of foetuses for the reason of being female is a modern extension of the 
same barbarous practice.) 

e (10) This is also a prophetic reference to the distant future, with the circula- 
tion of books and papers to an incredible extent. The Muslim world did immense 
service to the cause of the circulation of literature, and the revival of learning in 
the West, which has brought about the great spread of books and papers, was a 
direct result of the impetus which Islam gave to the study of letters. 

/(ll) The removal of the covering of the heaven signifies the unveiling of 
the mysteries relating to the heavens, which is one of the great achievements of 
modern science. Compare 99:2 where the earth is spoken of as yielding her 
treasures. 

g (12) Just as the righteous are promised heaven in this very life, the wicked 
are told that hell would be kindled for them even here, if they had only the eyes to 
see it. Compare 79:36. The forces of materialism have already engulfed the world 
in a burning hell in the form of modern wars. 

h (13) God has not doomed this world to utter destruction, but when it has 
tasted somewhat of the evil consequences of its own doings, Divine mercy will

ger, 20 the possessor of strength, established in the presence of the 
Lord of the Throne, 21 one (to be) obeyed, and faithful. c 22 And your

take it by the hand and bring the Garden of bliss near to it by bringing about a 
spiritual awakening. Thus the solace of mind which man can attain to through 
realization of the Divine in him is here described as the bringing near of the Garden. 

a (14) Man will then become conscious that there is a higher life, which is 
his real goal, and he will know what to do to attain that goal. 

b (18) The calling to witness of the stars that run their course and set also 
draws attention to the disasters that awaited the opponents of the Truth; see 53:1 
footnote. The departing of the night and the rise of the bright morning is clearly 
the disappearance of the darkness of ignorance, giving place to the bright light of 
the sun of Islam. 

c (21) Verses 19-21 refer to the Holy Prophet Muhammad. He is the 
bountiful Messenger (Rasiil Karim), the one to be obeyed (see 4:64), and the 
faithful (al-Amin). His being possessor of strength prophetically refers to his 
future career and to his ultimate triumph over his enemies. 

d (23) This means that his light would shine in the remotest corners of the 
world. See also 53:7 and footnote. 

e (24) This shows that there are some great prophecies relating to the future 
in what has gone before. 

/(26) Wonder is expressed that despite the clearest evidence of Truth, 
humanity has been so slow to accept it. 

g (27) This, one of the earliest revelations, clearly shows that the foundations 
of the universality of the message of Islam were laid on the very first day. 

h (29) See 76:30 footnote for explanation. 



Chapter 82 
Ai-infitar The Tearing Apart 

This chapter, which receives its title from the mention in the first verse of the 
heaven becoming torn apart, is a counterpart of the previous chapter since it 
refers to the final triumph of Islam in its opening verses. It speaks also of the 
utter helplessness of the opponents at that time. Its revelation belongs to the 
very early period at Makkah. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 When the heaven is torn apart, 2 and when the stars become 
dispersed, 3 and when the rivers are made to flow forth, 4 and when 
the graves are laid open" — 5 every soul will know what it has sent 
ahead and what it has held back. 6 

6 O man, what entices you away from jour Lord, the Gracious? 
7 Who created you, then made you complete, then made you in a 
right good state — "into whatever form He pleases He casts you. 
9 No, but you call the Judgment a lie, 10 and surely there are keepers 



a (4) Taken metaphorically verses 1—4 tell us how a great spiritual rising 
would be brought about. The tearing apart of the heaven would mean that the 
doors of heaven will open and Divine help will come to the Prophet. The dispers- 
ing of the stars signifies the spreading abroad of the bearers of the message of 
Truth, who are likened to stars, as the Prophet said: "My companions are as stars" 
(Mishkat, 27:13). The indication is that a time would come when the teachers of 
Truth would disperse themselves in Arabia, and then throughout the world. The 
flowing forth of the rivers means that rivers of Divine knowledge would be made 
to reach the dry lands within and without Arabia. The laying open of the graves 
signifies the spiritual resurrection which was to be brought about by the Holy 
Prophet, for the reprobate are clearly spoken of as being in the graves (35:22). 
Thus all these four verses speak of the great change that was to be brought about 
in the world by the preaching of the Prophet. Taken literally, these verses speak of 
the Resurrection. 

b (5) The knowledge spoken of here will accrue before the day of 
Resurrection. A greater manifestation of the same will, however, take place in the 
life after death.

over you, "honourable recorders, 12 they know what you do. a 

13 Surely the virtuous are in bliss, 14 and the wicked are truly 
in burning Fire — 15 they will enter it on the day of Judgment. 
16 And will not be absent from it. 17 And what will make you realize 
what the day of Judgment is? 18 Again, what will make you realize 
what the day of Judgment is? 19 The day when no soul controls 
anything for (the benefit of) another soul. And the command on 
that day is Allah's. 



a (12) That every action of man is recorded and bears fruit is one of the prin- 
cipal doctrines of the religion of Islam. Of course, it is not meant that angels are 
sitting with pens in their hands, at desks, noting down who did a good deed, or 
who did a bad deed, and at what time. That would be a distortion of the teaching 
of the Quran. For what that record is, see the next chapter, where both the record 
of the righteous and the record of the wicked is spoken of. See also 17:13-14. 



Chapter 83 
Ai-Tatfif Default in Duty 

This chapter condemns those who make a default in their duties or cheat 
others, in particular by giving short measure; hence its name. It teaches the 
utmost rectitude in one's dealings. The chapter explains the nature of the two 
records: that of the wicked and that of the virtuous. The guilty suffer because 
they defraud and cheat others. The virtuous prosper because they fulfil their 
duties and are true to their obligations. Its revelation belongs to the very early 
period at Makkah. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Woe to the cheaters," 2 who, when they take the measure (of 
their dues) from people, take it fully, 3 but when they measure out 
to others or weigh out for them, they give less than is due! 4 Do 
they not think that they will be raised again, 5 to a mighty day? — 
6 the day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds. 

7 No, surely the record of the wicked is in the prison. 8 And 
what will make you know what the prison is? 9 It is a written book. 
10 Woe on that day to the rejectors n who call the day of Judgment 
a lie! 12 And none calls it a lie but every exceeder of limits, every 
sinful one; 13 when Our messages are recited to him, he says: 
Stories of the ancients! 14 No, rather, what they earned is rust upon 



a (1) The cheaters are not only those who cheat others by giving them less 
than what is their due, but also those who make a default in any of their duties. 
The taking of the measure and the measuring out, in the next two verses, must 
also be read in a general sense. 

b (7) This prison should not be taken as signifying a jail, for in the verses 
that follow the Quran itself explains what this prison is. In v. 9, it is spoken of as 
a written book. This written book or record, which preserves the deeds of the 
evildoers, is called a prison because it keeps their faculties for the doing of good 
shut up as within a prison, and the very consequences of their evil deeds hamper 
their progress. See verses 14 and 15, where the actions of the evildoers are spoken 
of as being rust on their hearts, and they are further referred to as being debarred 
from their Lord. 



761 



762 83. DEFAULT IN DUTY • 83 : 15 

their hearts. 15 No, surely they are that day debarred from their 
Lord." 16 Then they will surely enter the burning Fire. 17 Then it 
will be said: This is what you called a lie. 

18 No, surely the record of the virtuous is in the highest 
places. 19 And what will make you know what the highest places 
are? 20 It is a written book. 21 Those drawn near (to Allah) witness 
it. 22 Surely the virtuous are in bliss, 23 on raised couches, gazing — 
24 you recognize in their faces the brightness of bliss. 25 They are 
given to drink of a pure drink, sealed. 26 The sealing of it is (with) 
musk. And for that let the aspirers aspire. 27 And it is tempered 
with water coming from above c — 28 a fountain from which drink 
those drawn near (to Allah). 

29 Surely they who are guilty used to laugh at those who 
believe. 30 And when they passed by them, they winked at one 
another, 31 and when they returned to their people, they returned 
exulting. 32 And when they saw them, they said: Surely these are in 
error — 33 and they were not sent as keepers over them. 34 So this 
day those who believe laugh at the disbelievers — 35 on raised 
couches, gazing. 36 Surely the disbelievers are rewarded as they 
did. 



a (15) The punishment of the wicked is here described as their being debarred 
from their Lord. They have no consciousness of the Higher Presence and, being 
thus debarred from their Lord in this life, enter the burning Fire in the next, as 
plainly stated in the verse that follows. 

b (18) Like the prison of v. 7, these are not actual places. The highest places 
are the records of the best deeds, which enable man to soar high and cut off the 
chains which bind him to low desires. 

c (27) The "water coming from above" (Arabic: tasnim) signifies spiritually 
the knowledge of Allah, because it is from this source that those who are drawn 
near to Allah (v. 28) are made to drink. 

d (34) The laughing of the believers is not to be taken literally. It signifies 
only the brightness of hope in their faces. The laughing in this case simply ex- 
presses a condition of joy which should make one laugh. The reversal of the con- 
dition of the believers and the disbelievers is all that is meant. 



Chapter 84 
Ai-insMqaq The Bursting Apart 

This chapter receives its title from the bursting apart of the heaven or the 
cloud mentioned in the first verse. The subject-matter is similar to that of the 
previous chapter. It is one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 When the heaven bursts apart," 2 and listens to its Lord and 
is made fit; 3 and when the earth is stretched,' 4 and casts forth 
what is in it and becomes empty, 5 and listens to its Lord and is 
made fit. 6 man, you must strive a hard striving (to attain) to your 
Lord, until you meet Him. 7 Then as to him who is given his book 
in his right hand, 8 his account will be taken by an easy reckoning, 
'and he will go back to his people rejoicing. 10 And as to him who 
is given his book behind his back, n he will call for (his own) 



a (1) Verses 1-5 speak of an ordinary phenomenon of nature, namely, the 
coming down of rain and the growth of vegetation, as a reference to the trans- 
formation which was to be brought about by the Divine revelation. The bursting 
apart of heaven here stands for the coming down of rain; compare 25:25: "And on 
the day when the heaven bursts apart with clouds". 

b (2) By the cloud or heaven listening to its Lord, and the earth listening to 
its Lord in v. 5, is meant their obedience to His commandment. In both cases it is 
added that they are made fit for listening to and obeying the Divine command- 
ments, meaning that it is their very nature to be entirely submissive to the Divine 
commandments. 

c (3) The stretching of the earth signifies the same as its stirring and 
swelling in 22:5 and 41:39. The meaning is the producing of vegetation, and the 
expression here, as in those verses, signifies metaphorically that Divine revelation 
gives spiritual life to man. The meaning of the earth being stretched is explained 
in the next verse: it casts forth what is in it and becomes empty, i.e., the treasures 
of life latent within it are brought to light by the coming down of rain. 

d (6) This is the conclusion to which a consideration of the first five verses 
leads. Man must strive hard to attain to his Lord. Those who do this are ultimately 
joyful (v. 9), but those who give themselves up to the pleasures of this life (v. 13) 
shall afterwards be in a sad plight (v. 11). 



763 



764 84. THE BURSTING APART • 84 : 12 

destruction, 12 and enter into burning Fire. 13 Surely he was (formerly) 
joyful among his people. 14 Surely he thought that he would never 
return (to Allah) — 15 Indeed! surely his Lord is ever Seer of him. 

16 But no, I call to witness the sunset redness, 17 and the night 
and what it drives away, 18 and the moon when it grows full," 
19 that you shall certainly ascend to one state after another. 

20 But what is the matter with them that they do not believe? 
21 And, when the Quran is recited to them, they do not adore (Him)? 
22 No, those who disbelieve reject (it) — 23 and Allah knows best 
what they hide. 24 So announce to them a painful punishment, 
25 except those who believe and do good — for them is a reward 
never to be cut off. 



a (18) Verses 16-18 draw attention to another phenomenon of nature, there- 
by indicating the departure of the power of the opponents of Truth. The sunset 
redness stands here for the disappearing sun of the power of the opponents, the 
night of adversity, which was now to overtake them, driving before it what vestige 
of light had remained. But they were not to remain submerged in darkness forever, 
for the moon (the Holy Prophet) had already made its appearance and would soon 
grow full, when the Arab nation was to march forth to conquer the world, the 
moon being a symbol of the power of the Arabs. For an alternative significance, 
see next note. 

b (19) This verse can be taken to speak of the advancement of the cause of 
the Prophet (Bukhari, 65.84:2). The people addressed here are thus the Muslims, 
who are told that they will go on making progress in the world, but it will be a 
gradual progress, and there may be set-backs. But the ultimate state would be one 
of triumph. In this case the night spoken of in the previous verse would mean the 
adversities which Islam itself will have to face, and the full moon would indicate 
its final triumph. The commentators also explain this verse as being a prophecy of 
the ultimate triumph of Islam. 



Chapter 85 
Ai-Buraj The Stars 

This chapter takes its title from the mention in the first verse of the heaven 
full of stars, which indicates that persons bearing the light of Islam will 
spread far and wide. The chapter refers to past history to show that those who 
persecute the believers will meet with destruction, as happened before. It is 
one of the very early revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By the heaven full of stars! 2 And the Promised day! 3 And the 
bearer of witness and that to which witness is borne!" ''Destruc- 
tion overtake the companions of the trench! — 5 the fire fed with 
fuel — 'when they sit by it, 7 and they are witnesses of what they 
do with the believers. 8 And they punished them for nothing except 



a (3) Buruj is the plural of bur; which means a tower or fortress or a sign of 
the Zodiac or a star or constellation. Its root meaning is that of becoming manifest 
or high, and hence the various significations. As in 82:2 (see 82:4 footnote), the 
stars stand for the lesser lights, i.e. companions of the Prophet or the bearers of 
the message of Truth to people, in comparison with the sun to which the Prophet 
himself is likened (33:46). In the heaven full of stars there is thus a reference to 
the preachers of Truth, who will scatter far and wide. Hence the mention of the 
promised day in v. 2, the day of the triumph of Truth. The word shahid (bearer of 
witness) here and shahid elsewhere (see 4:41, etc.) both signify the Prophet. "That 
to which witness is borne" is the message of Truth, or it means those against whom 
the Prophet bears witness, i.e., the opponents of Truth. 

b (4) The commentators give three different versions of the story supposed 
to be referred to in this verse, the best-known being that the reference is to the 
persecution of some Christians by Dhu Nawas, a king of Yaman, who was of the 
Jewish religion. One opinion holds that the reference may be to Nebuchadnezzar's 
casting Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego into the fiery furnace (Daniel 3:19- 
21). However, there may, as well, be a prophetical reference here to the great 
Arab army against which the Muslims were compelled to defend themselves by 
means of a trench, in what is called the battle of the Allies or the battle of the Ditch; 
see 33:9 footnote 1. The words of v. 7, and particularly of v. 10, clearly show that 
the reference here is to the enemies of the Holy Prophet, who persecuted the 
believing men and the believing women.

that they believed in Allah, the Mighty, the Praised, 9 Whose is the 
kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Witness of all 
things. 10 Those who persecute believing men and believing women, 
then do not repent, theirs is the punishment of hell, and theirs the 
punishment of burning. n Those who believe and do good, theirs 
are Gardens in which rivers flow. That is the great achievement. 

12 Surely the grip of jour Lord is severe. 13 Surely He it is Who 
creates first and reproduces; 14 and He is the Forgiving, the Loving, 
15 Lord of the Throne of Power, the Glorious, 16 Doer of what He 
intends. 

17 Has not the story come to you of the forces, 18 of Pharaoh 
and Thamud? 19 But those who disbelieve deny — 20 and Allah 
encompasses them on all sides. 21 Indeed, it is a glorious Quran, 
22 in a guarded tablet." 



a (22) The significance of these words is simply that the Quran is guarded 
against corruption and against the attacks of its opponents; compare 15:9: "Surely 
We have revealed the Reminder and surely We are its Guardian". There is no 
mention here or anywhere else in the Quran of the "guarded tablet" (lauh mahfuz) 
on which the decrees of God are written; but even if the reference here be to it, the 
significance is still the same, namely, that the Quran shall be fully guarded. 



Chapter 86 
Ai-jariq The Comer By Night 

This chapter states how great were the difficulties which the Holy Prophet 
faced in bringing light to a benighted world, and in the first verse he is called 
The Comer by Night; hence the title. He is given comfort that a spiritual 
resurrection will be brought about. This chapter is among the earliest revela- 
tions. The reference at the close of the chapter to plans against the Holy 
Prophet may be prophetical. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By the heaven and the Comer by night! 2 And what will 
make you know what the Comer by night is? 3 The star of piercing 
brightness a — 4 there is not a soul but over it is a keeper.* 

5 So let man consider of what he is created. 6 He is created of 
water pouring forth, 7 coming from between the back and the ribs. e 



a (3) Tariq (from tarq, striking a thing) originally signifies a comer by night, 
because one who comes by night finds the doors shut, and knocking at the doors 
becomes necessary. The Comer by night is here the Holy Prophet; the revelation 
of the Quran is also spoken of as taking place on a blessed night (44:3, 97:1). The 
reason is that the Holy Prophet appeared when total darkness spread on the earth, 
and no one ever stood more in need of knocking at the doors which were shut 
against him and fastened with strong bolts. It is noteworthy that Jesus compares 
his advent to that of a thief. ". . .if the master of the house had known what hour 
the thief would come, he would have watched. . . Therefore you also be ready, for 
the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect" (Matthew, 24:43^14). It 
may be added that Tariq is also the name given to the morning star, because it 
comes at the end of the night. 

The Comer by night is called the star of piercing brightness, indicating that 
the Comer by night is a star of such resplendent brightness that all darkness will 
be dispelled before him. 

b (4) Though the words are general, and signify that the deeds done by man 
are guarded so that he cannot escape their consequences, there is also a comfort 
for the Holy Prophet here that his opponents will not be able to harm him and that 
in time they will meet their doom. This is made clear at the end of the chapter. 

c (7) Water pouring forth refers to sperms. The expression between the back

8 Surely He is Able to return him (to life). 9 0n the day when hidden 
things are manifested," 10 then he will have no strength nor helper. 

11 By the cloud giving rain, 12 and the earth opening (with 
vegetation)! 13 Surely it is a decisive word, 14 and it is not a joke. 

15 Surely they plan a plan, 16 and I plan a plan. 17 So grant the 
disbelievers a respite — let them alone for a while.' 



and the ribs is a euphemism. A similar expression occurs in a saying of the Holy 
Prophet: "Whoever gives me a guarantee as to that which is between his two jaws 
and that which is between his two feet, I guarantee for him paradise" (Mishkat, 
24:10), the significance being the control of the tongue and the control of lust. 

a (9) Note this description of the day of Resurrection. The hidden things are 
the consequences of one's good or evil deeds, which will be made palpably mani- 
fest in the shape of Gardens and fruits or chains and Fire. 

b (13) The decisive word is the Quran. Just as when rain comes down, the 
earth produces vegetation, so the coming of the Divine revelation is bound to raise 
a dead nation to life, and no efforts against it would hamper its progress. There is 
also a reference to the doom of the disbelievers in v. 10, in the words he will have 
no strength nor helper. 

c (17) Whatever doubt there may be as to the significance of this chapter, it 
is dispelled by the last three verses, which speak of the plans of the opponents to 
exterminate Truth. The plan of God could not be frustrated, and the earth will 
receive life, but the Prophet is told to wait for a while. The same is true today. 



Chapter 87 
Ai-A'ia The Most High 

The title of this chapter is taken from the command to the Holy Prophet in 
the first verse to glorify his Lord, the word for "Lord" being Rabb meaning 
"nourisher to perfection", Who is also described here as The Most High. This 
indicates that the Holy Prophet himself would be raised to the highest posi- 
tion. The mention of the scriptures of Abraham and Moses in the final verse 
is to show not only that the Holy Quran agrees with previous scriptures in 
essential principles but also that those books contain prophecies about the 
Prophet Muhammad. This chapter is one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High!" 2 Who 
creates, then makes complete, 3 and Who measures, then guides, 
4 and Who brings forth vegetation, 5 then makes it dried up, dust- 
coloured^ 



a (1) This states that not only would the Holy Prophet be raised to the 
highest place to which man can rise, but everyone, through the glorification of 
God, can rise to the highest place to which he is capable of rising. Hence the order 
to glorify The Most High is immediately followed by the words that He not only 
creates and makes complete but has also ordained a measure for everyone and He 
guides everyone to this goal. 

b (3) Verses 2 and 3 speak of four Divine acts: creation, completion, 
measuring, and guiding. Everything in this universe is subject to these four laws, 
and so is man. He is created from a very humble and low beginning, his first 
condition being that of a life-germ which cannot be seen. Then it develops gradually 
to complete human form. This is the subject-matter of v. 2. The third verse then 
lays down that everything in creation is held under control: it is made according to 
a measure and its progress lies along a certain line; and that it is God Who guides 
it or makes it walk along that line. The whole is in special reference to the 
spiritual advancement of man through Divine glorification. 

c (5) Vegetation, too, receives life but there is no higher purpose in its crea- 
tion beyond the fact that it serves to sustain man; so it dries up. But there is a 
higher purpose in the creation of man; and it is to fulfil that purpose that God 
sends His revelation, which is spoken of in the next verse. 



769 



770 87. THE MOST HIGH • 87 : 6 

6 We shall make you recite so you shall not forget — 7 except 
what Allah please." Surely He knows the manifest and what is 
hidden. 8 And We shall make your way smooth to a state of ease. 
9 So remind, reminding indeed benefits. c 10 He who fears will be 
mindful, n and the most unfortunate one will avoid it, 12 who will 
burn in the great Fire. 13 Then he will neither die in it, nor live. 

14 He indeed is successful who purifies himself, 15 and 
remembers the name of his Lord, then prays. 16 But you prefer the 
life of this world, 17 while the Hereafter is better and more lasting. 
18 Surely this is in the earlier scriptures, 19 the scriptures of Abraham 
and Moses. 6 



a (7) Man is apt to forget, and the Prophet was a human being and he too 
was apt to forget. But he never forgot a word of the Divine revelation which came 
to him. He sometimes received long chapters on a single occasion, but the whole 
was so deeply impressed on his mind that once it was read out to him by the Holy 
Spirit, he repeated it without forgetting a word of it. Still more difficult was his 
task when chapters were received piecemeal. The reference in what Allah please 
is not to Divine revelation which the Prophet never forgot, but to other things 
which he forgot as a human being. 

b (8) The words predict the Holy Prophet's triumph and the removal of the 
distress in which Islam was. 

c (9) The Arabic word in here means indeed and not if. There are numerous 
instances of this in the Quran as well as in Arabic prose and poetry. 

rf(13) There is no life in hell, for life is only for the righteous; neither is 
there death, because death signifies a state of complete rest. 

e (19) The preference of the good of the Hereafter to the transitory advan- 
tage of this life is the one great truth preached by all prophets. There is also a 
reference here to the prophecies concerning the Holy Prophet which are to be 
found in the revelation granted respectively to Abraham and to Moses; see 2:124 
footnote and 2:41 footnote. Or, the essential principles of religion are meant, 
which are common to all the great religions. 



Chapter 88 
Ai-GMshiyah The Overwhelming Event 

The Overwhelming Event, whose mention in the first verse supplies the name 
of this chapter, is the doom of the opponents in this life and their punishment 
in the Hereafter. The date of revelation is placed about the fourth year of the 
Holy Prophet's mission. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Has the news come to you of the Overwhelming Event? " 
2 Faces on that day will be downcast, labouring, toiling, 4 entering 
burning Fire, 5 made to drink from a boiling spring. 6 They will have 
no food but of thorns, 7 neither nourishing nor satisfying hunger. 
"Faces on that day will be happy, 'glad for their striving, 10 in a 
lofty Garden, n in which you will hear no vain talk. 12 In it there is 
a fountain flowing. 13 In it there are thrones raised high, 14 and 
drinking-cups ready placed, 15 and cushions set in rows, 16 and 
carpets spread out. 

17 Do they not see the clouds, how they are created? 18 And 
the heaven, how it is raised high? 19 And the mountains, how they 
are fixed? 20 And the earth, how it is spread out? 21 So remind. Fou 
are one to remind only. 22 Ybu are not a warder over them — 23 but 
whoever turns back and disbelieves, 24 AUah will punish him with 
the greatest punishment. 25 Surely to Us is their return. 26 Then it is 
for Us to call them to account. 



a (1) The Overwhelming Event is no doubt the Resurrection, but the over- 
whelming event of this life is the doom of the opponents of Truth. The description 
of the two parties that follows applies to an utterly discomfited and disappointed 
enemy and to the faithful in the hour of their triumph. 

b (17) Ibil also means clouds that bear the water for rain. This significance 
suits the context better than the usual rendering, the camels. The mention of the 
clouds along with the heavens, where they exist, and with mountains, which cool 
the vapours so that they pour down water, and the earth, which benefits by that 
water, is in accordance with what is said in many other places. 



771 



Chapter 89 
Ai-Fajr The Daybreak 

The important Daybreak mentioned in the first verse, after which this chapter 
is named, is the first morning of the month of Dhu-l-Hiijah, the month of the 
pilgrimage, because this institution had given Makkah great importance as a 
trade centre and brought material prosperity to its residents. A warning is given 
here of the punishment that must overtake the city, as punishment overtook 
earlier people. It is one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By the daybreak! 2 And the ten nights! 3 And the even and the 
odd! 4 And the night when it departs \ a 5 Truly in this is an oath for 
those who have understanding. 6 Have you not considered how 
your Lord dealt with Ad, 7 (of) Iram, 6 having lofty buildings, 
"whose like were not created in the land; 9 and (with) Thamud, 
who carved out rocks in the valley (to make houses); 10 and 
Pharaoh, the lord of armies, n who exceeded limits in the cities, 
12 and made great mischief in them? 13 So your Lord poured on 
them a portion of punishment. c 



a (4) There is a great variety of opinion as to what is meant by the daybreak, 
the ten nights, and the even and the odd. The reference may be to the importance 
attached to Makkah (which is mentioned as The City at the commencement of the 
next chapter), because it was not only the spiritual centre of Arabia, but had also 
become its trade centre, on account of pilgrims resorting to it from all parts of 
Arabia. The daybreak would thus signify the daybreak of the first of the month of 
Dhu-l-Hijjah; the ten nights would stand for the first ten nights of that month, the 
tenth day being the day of sacrifices. The even may refer to the creation, which 
consists of pairs (51:49), and the odd to the Creator Who is one. The whole is a 
warning to the people of Makkah that, if they do not heed the warning, their end 
will be the same as the end of previous rejectors of truth. 

b (7) Iram or Aram may be the name of the grandfather of Ad, from whom 
the tribe took its name or the name of a city in which it lived. 

c (13) The meaning is that they received a portion of the punishment here, 
greater punishment overtaking them after death. 



772 



89 : 14 • THE DAYBREAK 773 

14 Surely your Lord is Watchful. 15 As for man, when his Lord 
tries him, so (that) He gives him honour and favours him, he says: 
My Lord honours me. 16 But when He tries him, so (that) He 
restricts for him his (means of) subsistence, he says: My Lord has 
disgraced me." 17 No, but you do not honour the orphan, 18 nor do 
you urge one another to feed the poor,* 19 and you devour heritage, 
devouring all, e 20 and you love wealth with exceeding love. 

21 No indeed! When the earth is made to crumble to pieces, 
22 and your Lord comes with the angels, ranks on ranks; 23 and hell 
is made to appear that day. On that day man will be mindful, and 
of what use will being mindful be then? 24 He will say: I wish I had 
sent (good deeds) ahead for this life of mine! 25 But none can 
punish as He will punish on that day. 26 And none can bind as He 
will bind on that day. 

27 O soul that are at rest, 28 return to your Lord, well-pleased 
(with Him), well-pleasing (Him). 29 So enter among My servants, 
30 and enter My Garden! 6 



a (16) God tries man both by granting him affluence, in which case he is 
puffed up with pride and says that his wealth is an indication that God honours 
him, and by poverty, in which case he thinks that God has disgraced him. 

b (18) Verses 17-19 show how the Prophet felt for the orphans, the poor and 
the weak, so much so that he warns his powerful and wealthy opponents that their 
indifference to the orphans and the poor and their injustice to the weak will bring 
down upon them the Divine judgment, which will shatter their power. He remained, 
to the end, a true well-wisher of the weak and the oppressed. When he became the 
head of a State, he provided for the orphans and the poor out of the public funds; 
see 9:60. 

c (19) Among the Arabs, women and young children were not allowed to 
have any share in the inheritance, because they could not fight the enemy. 

d (26) These words indicate the severity of the punishment. 

e (30) Verses 27-30 refer to the highest stage of the spiritual development of 
man, the stage in which he rests contented with his Lord. At this last stage, the 
pure and perfect sincerity, truth and righteousness of a person are rewarded by 
Almighty God by granting him a heaven on this earth. It is at this stage too that a 
person realizes that the prayers and worship which at first appeared to him as a 
burden are really a nourishment on which the growth of his soul depends, and that 
this is the basis of his spiritual development. 



Chapter 90 
Ai-Baiad The City 

The City spoken of in the first verse, from which this chapter receives its name, 
is Makkah, which in the last chapter was warned of punishment overtaking it. 
But it was to be the spiritual centre of the whole world, when Muslims would 
be made free from all obligations in it, as stated in the second verse. The 
second half of the chapter speaks of the importance of attempting the uphill 
struggle for the service of humanity, which marks a great nation. It is one of 
the earliest revelations, assigned to the first year of the Holy Prophet's mission. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 No, I call to witness this City!" 2 And you will be made free 
from obligation in this City — 3 And the father and the offspring 
whom he produced! 6 4 We have certainly created man to face 
difficulties."' 5 Does he think that no one has power over him? 6 He 
will say: I have wasted much wealth. 6 7 Does he think that no one 
sees him? 

8 Have We not given him two eyes, 9 and a tongue and two 
lips, 10 and pointed out to him the two conspicuous ways? n But 
he does not attempt the uphill road. 12 And what will make you 
comprehend what the uphill road is? 13 (It is) to free a slave, 14 or to 
feed in a day of hunger 15 an orphan near of kin, 16 or the poor man 
lying in the dust/ i 7 Then he is of those who believe and exhort 
one another to patience, and exhort one another to mercy. 18 These 
are the people of the right hand. 19 And those who disbelieve in 
Our messages, they are the people of the left hand. 20 On them is 
Fire closed over. 



a (1) By this City is meant Makkah. Thousands of years before, Abraham 
had prayed for a city to be raised in that wilderness where he had left one branch 
of his descendants (14:37), and for a Prophet to be raised among them (2:129). 

b (2) The translation here is in accordance with the true significance of the 
word hill, meaning being from obligation or responsibility with respect to some- 
thing. The statement is prophetical, indicating that the Prophet would be made 
free from obligation in respect to the sacredness of the territory of Makkah, being 

774 



Ch. 90 • THE CITY 775 

allowed to enter it by force, as he did at the conquest of Makkah, to which, in fact, 
the words refer. 

c (3) The father is none other than Abraham, the progenitor of the Arabs, 
and by the offspring whom he produced is meant either Ishmael, who assisted 
Abraham in raising the foundations of the Sacred House at Makkah, or the Holy 
Prophet himself, who was the object of Abraham's prayer. 

d (4) The advancement of man, even physically, lies along a path of hard 
struggle. The same is the case in the sphere of the spiritual advancement of man. 
Abraham suffered great hardships in the cause of Truth; and so must the Prophet 
now, in order to bring about a spiritual awakening in the world. It is only a long 
and hard struggle on the part of certain benefactors of humanity that makes man' s 
advancement possible, physically as well as spiritually. 

e (6) The opponents, after spending all their wealth for the extermination of 
Truth, would find that the cause of Truth was triumphant, and would then say that 
they really wasted their wealth in a wrong cause. 

/"(10) The two conspicuous ways are the ways of truth and falsehood in word 
or good and evil in deed. The two eyes (v. 8) enable him to distinguish good from 
evil, while with the tongue and the lips (v. 9) he can ask, if he cannot see for 
himself. 

g (16) The service of humanity, along with the service of God, is the one 
topic of these earliest revelations. The doing of good to the oppressed, the poor, 
and the orphans is called an uphill road or a high mountain because of the diffi- 
culty of doing it. The constant reference to the helping of the poor and the orphans 
and the setting free of slaves brings to light the real character of the Prophet, who 
is described by one knowing him most intimately as one who earned for those 
who had no means themselves (Bukhari, 1:1). No religion has laid so much stress 
on the uplift of the poor and the distressed as Islam, and it is the only religion 
which enjoins the duty of granting freedom to slaves, and the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad is the only founder of a religion who showed the noble example of 
freeing all slaves that he ever had and helping in the freeing of others. The latest 
revelation in 9:60 contains plain directions to the State itself to spend a part of the 
public funds in purchasing freedom for slaves. 



Chapter 91 

Al-Shams The Sun 

The Holy Prophet is the Sun of righteousness, the word in the first verse after 
which this chapter is named. With the rising of this sun, the way to perfection 
is pointed out to man. But only those who purify themselves are really 
successful, while those who give themselves over to corruption meet with 
failure, as illustrated by the case of Thamud. It is one of the earliest revela- 
tions, like the last chapter. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

I By the sun and its brightness!" 2 And the moon when it 
borrows light from it! 3 And the day when it exposes it to view! 
4 And the night when it draws a veil over it! * 5 And the heaven and 
its make! 6 And the earth and its extension! 7 And the soul and its 
perfection! e — 8 So He reveals to it its way of evil and its way of 
good; ' 9 he is indeed successful who causes it to grow, 10 and he 
indeed fails who buries it. e 

II Thamud rejected (the truth) in their inordinacy, 12 when 
the most wretched one among them broke forth with mischief — 
13 so Allah's messenger said to them: (Leave alone) Allah's she- 
camel, and (give) her (to) drink. 14 But they called him a liar and 
slaughtered her. So their Lord destroyed them for their sin and 
levelled them (with the ground); 15 and He does not fear its 
consequence/ 



a (1) This is to show that the spiritual light of the Prophet will brighten as 
time passes on. 

b (4) In the words "exposes it" (v. 3) and "draws a veil over it" (v. 4), the 
pronoun it refers to the world. 

c (7) The mention of the perfection of the soul of man in this verse is a 
sequel to what is stated in the first six verses. Man is here spoken of as possessing 
the highest of qualities which are met with in nature. The sun is a source of light, 
even so is the perfect man a source of spiritual light. The moon borrows the light 
of the sun, even so is the perfect man, whose light is really borrowed from the 
Divine source, which is the real source of all light. The day makes things manifest 

776 



Ch. 91 • THE SUN 777 

and thus enables man to carry on his struggle, while the night easts a veil over 
light and brings rest; the perfect man possesses both these qualities, as he carries 
on a very hard struggle for the attainment of great ends, and at the same time his 
mind is at rest and he possesses the quality of contentment. The heaven is raised 
high, and the earth is spread out for people to walk over, being thus a manifesta- 
tion of humility; the perfect man possesses both these qualities, having the highest 
of aspirations and being at the same time humble and lowly. The perfect man thus 
possesses the opposite qualities of giving light and receiving light, severe exertion 
and complete rest, greatness and humility. These qualities were possessed by the 
Holy Prophet, who invited others to make the same the goal of their lives. 

d (8) The verse is a fitting sequel to the statement made in the previous verse 
as regards the perfection of the soul, as it points out the way to perfection. It is 
through Divine inspiration, or revelation, that the soul is made perfect, because 
Divine revelation makes clear the two ways, the way of evil and the way of good. 
It is by avoiding the former and walking in the latter that perfection can be attained. 

e (10) The words for "causes it to grow" (zakkd-ha) and "buries it" (dassa- 
ha) also have the secondary meaning of purifies it and corrupts it respectively. 
The adoption of these two words really indicates that the faculties necessary for 
perfection are given to everyone, but there are some who make them thrive by 
their development and others who corrupt them by allowing them to remain 
concealed, not displaying them to their advantage. 

/(ll) The verse gives an instance of those whose end is failure on account 
of the corrupt manner of their lives, giving at the same time a warning to people 
that, if they continued in their evil course and did not turn to righteousness, 
following the call of the Prophet, their end would be the same. If they followed 
the Prophet, they would attain to perfection, but, if they went against him, they 
would be given over to destruction as were the former people. 

g (15) Allah does not care for the consequences of the punishment to a 
people when they are found deserving of such punishment, for through their 
destruction comes life to humanity. 



Chapter 92 
Ai-Laii The Night 

The object of this chapter is to show that The Night of disbelief and ignorance, 
indicated in the first verse, will give place to the light of the day. It tells us 
that while people are striving after different ends, those who strive for good 
and charitable works will have their path eased for them but those who go 
after evil will find themselves in distress. It is one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By the night when it draws a veil! 2 And the day when it 
shines! 3 And the creating of the male and the female! — 4 Your 
striving is surely (for) diverse (ends). a 5 Then as for him who gives 
(charitably) and keeps his duty, 6 and accepts what is good — 7 We 
facilitate for him (the way to) ease. 8 And as for him who is 
miserly and considers himself self-sufficient, 9 and rejects what is 
good — 10 We facilitate for him (the way to) distress. n And his 
wealth will not avail him when he perishes.* 

12 Surely Ours is it to show the way, 13 and surely Ours is the 
Hereafter and the former. c 14 So I warn you of the Fire that flames. 
15 None will enter it but the most unfortunate, 16 who rejects and 
turns (his) back. 17 And away from it shall be kept the most faithful 
to duty, 18 who gives his wealth, purifying himself. 19 And none has 
with him any favour for a reward, 20 except the seeking of the 
pleasure of his Lord, the Most High/ 21 And he will soon be well- 
pleased. 



a (4) Evil is here compared with the darkness of the night and good with the 
light of day. The creation of the male and the female, which stands for the crea- 
tion of the whole of animate nature, because all living beings are created either 
male or female, is also a witness to the same truth, for there we find everyone 
striving for an end, and everyone reaping according to the manner of his striving. 

b (11) The two examples given in these verses represent those who accept 
and those who reject the Truth, respectively; the one goes on doing good deeds, 
finding his way quite easy, until he finds himself in ease, and the other goes on 
doing evil, the doing of which seems easy to him, until he finds himself in distress. 

778 



Ch. 92 • THE NIGHT 779 

c (13) The wicked one is here told that he will find himself in distress not 
only in the Hereafter but also in this life, as God has control of both. Or the two 
words refer to what is coming later, i.e. what is promised, and the present state. 

d (20) The pleasure of the Lord is the only favour for which a person should 
hope, and hence this is the goal of a Muslim's life — his paradise in this as well 
as the next life. This is in accordance with what is said in 9:72, one of the latest 
revelations: "And greatest of all is Allah's goodly pleasure. That is the mighty 
achievement". 



Chapter 93 
ai-dum The Brightness of the Day 

This chapter draws attention to the gradual spreading of the light of the sun of 
Islam, and thus has the title The Brightness of the Day, the word in the first verse. 
The last two chapters speak of the coming of the Holy Prophet as the rising 
of the sun. This shows that as sunshine is not fully resplendent immediately 
after the rising of the sun, so would Truth shine in its full brightness gradually. 
It is one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By the brightness of the day! 2 And the night when it is still! 
— 3 Four Lord has not forsaken you, nor is He displeased." 4 And 
surely the later state is better for you than the earlier. 5 And soon 
will jour Lord give you so that you will be well pleased.* 

6 Did He not find you an orphan and give (you) shelter?' 
7 And find you groping, so He showed the way? 8 And find you in 
want, so He enriched you? e 'Therefore the orphan, do not oppress. / 
10 And him who asks, do not rebuke. 8 u And the favour of your 
Lord, do proclaim.'' 



a (3) These words may be taken as words of solace in a general sense, the 
significance being that God would never forsake the Holy Prophet. But in the light 
of what follows, the words are prophetical, the indication being that in its later 
history Islam would have to face set-backs which might give rise to such doubts. 
The Prophet and his followers are therefore given an assurance that God will 
never forsake the cause of Islam. Force is lent to this interpretation by the fact that 
here it is not the night that is followed by the brightness of the day, which was the 
case at the appearance of the Prophet, but the brightness of the day is followed by 
the stillness of the night, which seems to be a reference to the inactivity of the 
Muslim people after the sun had shone, i.e., in later times. 

b (5) The words may mean that as time passes, the Prophet's cause would go 
on gaining strength, and the later state would always be better for him than the 
earlier. Or, the reference here is to the second rising of Islam, after what is called 
the stillness of the night in v. 2, a long pause of inactivity of the Muslims. 
References to a set-back to the cause of Islam for a long period are very frequent 
in the Quran; see 32:5 footnote. As a matter of fact, it is true that despite various 



780 



Ch. 93« THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE DAY 781 

set-backs at different periods of its history, the cause of Islam has gone on gaining 
ground. 

c (6) Abdullah, the Holy Prophet's father, died about three months before the 
Prophet was born; his mother, Aminah, died when he was six years old. His grand- 
father, Abdul Muttalib, who took care of him after his mother, died two years 
later, and from that time he remained in charge of Abu Talib, his uncle, who was 
alive when the Holy Prophet received the Divine message for the regeneration of 
mankind. 

d (7) The word dall ("groping") here signifies one who is unable to see the 
way for himself, and not one who is in error. See also 53:2 footnote. Verses 6, 7 
and 8 stand in close relation to verses 9, 10 and 11 respectively. Verse 6 tells the 
Prophet that he was himself an orphan, and v. 9 draws the conclusion that he should 
therefore not oppress the orphan; similarly, v. 8 speaks of the Divine favour to 
him in making him free from want, and v. 1 1 draws the conclusion that he should 
therefore proclaim the Divine favour to him. The same applies between v. 7 and 
v. 10. The latter plainly speaks of one who asks to be guided to the Truth. The 
Holy Prophet was no doubt "one who asks" (sd'il) in this sense. He did not worship 
idols, but neither could he, without the help of Allah, find out the way for the 
regeneration of his people, for which his soul yearned so eagerly. The word dall 
also signifies one who becomes lost, and the meaning may be that the Holy Prophet 
had so devoted himself to the quest of the right way for the world that he had lost 
himself in that quest. See also the introductory note to ch. 94. 

e (8) Finding the Holy Prophet in want, and enriching him, do not refer to 
his temporal or financial circumstances only, if they refer to them at all, but rather 
to his spiritual needs and the spiritual wealth with which he was enriched. 

/(9) Not taking care of the orphans is really their oppression. 

g (10) The reference is to one who asks about knowledge. This interpretation 
is corroborated by the incident related in the opening verses of ch. 80. 

h (11) The favour is no other than revelation, the greatest of all Divine 
favours, as it is recognized to be throughout the Quran. This was the favour which 
the Holy Prophet continued to announce throughout his life. 



Chapter 94 
Ai-insMrah The Expansion 

This chapter, like the ones before, comforts the Holy Prophet. His difficulties 
would soon be followed by ease, as his breast was opened or expanded to 
receive the Truth; hence the title. The great burden, which almost broke his 
back, meaning his deep anxiety for humanity, was removed by Divine reve- 
lation. This chapter is as a supplement to the preceding one. It is one of the 
earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Have We not expanded for you your breast (with Divine 
light)," 2 and removed from you your burden, 3 which weighed 
down your back,* 4 and exalted for you your mention? c 5 Surely 
with difficulty is ease, 6 with difficulty is surely ease/ 7 So when 
you are free (from anxiety), work hard, e 8 and make your Lord your 
exclusive object. 



a (1) The expanding of the breast is also mentioned in Moses' prayer in 
20:25: "My Lord, expand my breast for me". In 6:125 it is stated: "So whom- 
soever Allah intends to guide, He expands his breast for Islam". The expanding of 
the breast signifies its illumination with wisdom and Divine light, and filling with 
tranquillity. It stands for the greatness of the heart of the Holy Prophet. 

b (3) The burden which weighed down his hack signifies anxiety for raising 
humanity from the ignorance and superstition in which it was involved. Compare 
26:3: "Perhaps you will kill yourself with grief because they do not believe". The 
removal of the burden signifies giving relief from anxiety. 

c (4) This is a clear prophecy of the glorious eminence to which the Holy 
Prophet was to be raised, uttered at a time when he was alone and unknown. 

d (6) The ease refers to the ultimate triumph, and the difficulty to the trials 
which the Holy Prophet was then undergoing. But the passage as well reveals a 
general law of nature that difficulty is followed by ease. 

e (7) The Prophet's being /ree signifies bis freedom from anxiety, in reference 
to what is said in the previous verse. Being now free from all anxiety, he was to 
work hard for the regeneration of a fallen humanity, and make his Lord his exclu- 
sive object, i.e., apply himself wholly to establish the greatness of God. 



782 



Chapter 95 
Ai-Tin The Fig 

This chapter draws a comparison between the Mosaic system — of which the 
fig is a symbol, providing the name of this chapter — and the Islamic system 
to show that man can rise to the highest degree of eminence by following and 
acting on the right principles, and he degrades himself to the lowest if he is 
not guided by the right principles, or being so guided, he fails to act upon 
them. The chapter belongs to the same early period as those preceding it. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By the fig and the olive! 2 And mount Sinai! 3 And this city 
made secure!" — 4 Certainly We created man in the best make. 
5 Then We reduce him to the lowest of the low, 6 except those who 
believe and do good; so theirs is a reward never to be cut off. 7 So 
who can belie you after (this) about the Judgment? 8 Is not Allah 
the Best of the judges? ° 

a (3) The fig and the olive stand respectively for the law given on Mount 
Sinai and that revealed in the sacred city of Makkah. A comparison between 
Moses and the Holy Prophet Muhammad is introduced in very early revelations, 
as here and in 52:1-6 and 73:15. The incident of Jesus approaching a fig tree, and, 
upon finding no fruit on it, cursing it and the tree withering away (Matthew, 
21:18-19), symbolised the passing away of the law given on Mount Sinai. The 
olive is compared here with the law of the Holy Prophet Muhammad. This is 
explained by a later revelation according to which the light of Islam is "lit from a 
blessed olive tree, neither eastern nor western" (24:35). The comparison shows 
that, whereas the law given on Mount Sinai passed away like the fig tree in Jesus' 
parable, the new light, lit from the blessed olive tree, was never to be extinguished, 
because it belonged neither to the East nor to the West, but was meant for all 
mankind in all ages. 

b (6) By man's being created in the best make is meant his enormous capa- 
bility for advancement. When he does not take advantage of the opportunity 
offered to him, he is reduced to the lowest of the low. With unthought of advance- 
ment in science, people are even today flying at each other's throats like the beasts 
of the jungle, because they are not guided by Divine revelation. 

c (8) The Judgment is as well a judgment of the guilty in this life as in the 
next. 



783 



Chapter 96 

Al-'Alaq The Clot 

The first five verses of this chapter are by universal admission the first reve- 
lation which the Holy Prophet received. The chapter is entitled The Clot as 
the second verse states that God created man from a clot of blood, which con- 
tains a hint that, as a beautiful human form is developed out of such a humble 
origin, even so the Holy Prophet would raise humanity to the greatest eminence 
morally and spiritually. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Read in the name of jour Lord Who creates " — 2 creates man 
from a clot (of blood) — 3 read and your Lord is most Generous, c 
4 Who taught by the pen, 5 taught man what he did not know. 

6 No! Man is surely inordinate, 7 because he looks upon him- 
self as self-sufficient. 6 8 Surely to jour Lord is the return. 

9 Have you seen him who forbids 10 a servant when he prays? 
n Do you see if he is on the right way, 12 or enjoins observance of 
duty? 13 Do you see if he denies and turns away? 14 Does he not 
know that Allah sees? 15 No! If he does not stop, We will seize him 
by the forelock g — 16 a lying, sinful forelock! 17 Then let him 
summon his council, 18 We will summon the braves of the army. A 
19 No! Do not obey him, but prostrate yourself, and draw near (to 
Allah). 



a (1) The Arabs were a people who rarely made use of reading and writing, 
and the Prophet himself did not know reading or writing, yet the very first revela- 
tion which he received was a command to read. The significance of this order is 
expressed in v. 3, v. 2 being parenthetical as referring to the origin of man. The 
order to read is repeated in v. 3, adding that your Lord is most Generous, to show 
that it is through reading and writing that man can attain to a position of glory, 
while v. 4 says that it is by the use of the pen that knowledge can be acquired. The 
words in the name of your Lord signify by the help of your Lord. The use of the 
word Rabb (Nourisher to perfection), translated as Lord, shows that revelation 
was being granted to the Prophet, to bring him, and through him the whole of 
humanity, to perfection. 



784 



Ch. 96 • THE CLOT 785 

b (2) 'Alaq signifies a clot of blood as well as attachment and love. The 
former significance is the one generally adopted, because of the mention of 
'alaqah in the process of the creation of man in other places in the Quran, and it 
indicates the insignificance of man's origin. Having regard to the other signifi- 
cance of 'alaq, the words may, however, also be translated as meaning created 
man out of love. The Prophet is reported to have said: / (God) loved that I should 
be known, so I created man. 

c (3) The word Akram means Generous as well as Honourable. It has been 
used here in reference to the great goal of honour and glory which the Prophet 
was destined to attain. 

d (4) The mention of the pen in this, the very first, revelation of the Holy 
Prophet, is significant, and it not only indicates the help for propagating know- 
ledge of Islam which the Holy Prophet was to find in the pen, but signifies as well 
that the pen should be specially used in guarding the revelation which was to be 
granted to the Holy Prophet. It is a fact that the pen has played an important part 
in the propagation of Islam as well as in the protection of the Quran against corrup- 
tion of every sort. The frequent mention of writing and the pen in the Quran, and 
particularly in connection with the revelation of the Holy Prophet, is rather striking 
when it is borne in mind that not only was the use of writing a rare novelty in the 
Arabian peninsula, but the Prophet was himself unacquainted with writing and 
reading. 

e (7) Man becomes inordinate or rebellious because he thinks himself to be 
self-sufficient, and free from all need of God Who breathed into him of His Spirit. 
The soul of man has in fact a mystic relation with the invisible Divine Spirit, 
which the materialist fails to realize. 

/(10) So great was the opposition that the Prophet and his companions could 
not say their prayers in a public place. 

g (15) Seizing by the forelock signifies abasement. 

h (18) The significance of verses 17-18 is that they should take their decision 
unitedly and do their utmost against the Prophet and his message. The two verses 
thus clearly speak prophetically of the battles in which the mighty men of both 
sides were to be brought into conflict. 



Chapter 97 
Ai-Qadr The Majesty 

The very first revelation of the Holy Quran in ch. 96 is suitably followed in 
arrangement by this chapter which relates when the revelation began. It was 
on the Night of Majesty, one of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan, 
after which this chapter is named. Its coming on that night indicated that the 
most majestic of all revelations was now being granted to the world and that 
the majesty of this revelation, as well as of its recipient, would be established 
in the world. The chapter is unquestionably one of the very earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Surely We revealed it on the Night of Majesty" — 2 And 
what will make you comprehend what the Night of Majesty is? 
3 The Night of Majesty is better than a thousand months.* 4 The 
angels and the Spirit descend in it by the permission of their Lord 
— for every affair c — 5 Peace! it is till the rising of the morning.'' 



a (1) Lailat al-Qadr, literally the Night of Majesty or Grandeur or Greatness, 
is a well-known night in the last ten days of the month of Ramadan, being more 
probably the 25th or 27th or 29th night of the month. See 44:3 where it is called 
the blessed night. From 2:185, it appears that the Quran was revealed in the month 
of Ramadan, and from the above it appears to have been revealed on the Lailat al- 
Qadr; by revelation of course being meant the commencement of its revelation, 
because the whole was revealed in portions during twenty-three years; and the 
word "Quran" is applicable as well to a portion as to the whole. That the reference 
is here to the commencement of the revelation is also clear from the arrangement 
of the chapters, the opening verses of the last chapter being admittedly the first 
revelation to the Prophet. In fact, Lailat al-Qadr owes its importance to the fact 
that it was on this night that the most blessed and perfect of all revelations was 
given to the world. Moses' fasting for forty days before receiving revelation 
(Exodus, 34:28), and Jesus' keeping fast for the same number of days before he 
began preaching (Matthew, 4:2), show that Divine blessings are associated with 
fasting. Hence Muslims are required to fast every year for thirty days, and special 
Divine blessings are promised to them in the last days of the fasts. 

b (3) A thousand months may be taken as the equivalent of a very long time. 
Numerically they are equal to about 83 years, leaving 17 years to complete a 
century. There is a saying of the Holy Prophet according to which a mujaddid, or 
a reformer, will appear among the Muslims at the commencement of every century. 



786 



Ch. 97 • THE MAJESTY 787 

The Lailat al-Qadr being a time of great spiritual blessing may also signify the time 
during which the Prophet worked in person, being actually a period of twenty- 
three years, or the time during which a mujaddid would ordinarily work, which 
period is more blessed spiritually than the rest of the century. (Editor 's Note: A 
thousand months may represent the period of a person's lifetime. In an entire 
lifetime, but spent without Divine light, he cannot find the deep Divine truths, nor 
make the moral and spiritual progress, that he can by even a short contact with the 
spiritual blessings that descend with a man appointed by Allah.) 

c (4) The Spirit here may signify the Divine Spirit, which is really the force 
through which the regeneration of humanity is brought about, or it may mean 
Divine inspiration. The descent of the angels and the Spirit also shows that Lailat 
al-Qadr, as hinted at in the last note, has a deeper significance, for though a parti- 
cular night in the month of Ramadan may be characterized by great Divine 
blessings, it is more especially in connection with the mission of one appointed by 
Allah for the regeneration of the world that "the angels and the Spirit" come down 
from heaven, turning people's minds to the spiritual values of life. See also 44:3 
footnote. 

d (5) "Peace" is the distinctive mark of Lailat al-Qadr. This peace comes to 
the hearts of the true devotees in the form of a tranquillity of mind which makes 
them fit to receive Divine blessings. But it is also through one commissioned by 
God that the basis of peace among people is laid. 



Chapter 98 
Ai-Bayyinah The Clear Evidence 

The Holy Prophet, who received the mightiest of revelations, or that revela- 
tion itself, is here called The Clear Evidence. This revelation contained all the 
pure and essential teachings of previous scriptures, as stated in v. 3. It may 
not be a very early revelation but there seems no doubt that it belongs to the 
Makkah period. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Book 
and the idolaters could not have been freed till clear evidence 
came to them" — 2 a Messenger from Allah, reciting pure pages, 
3 in which are (all) right books. c 4 Nor did those to whom the Book 
was given become divided till clear evidence came to them. ' 
5 And they are enjoined nothing but to serve Allah, being sincere to 
Him in obedience, upright, and to keep up prayer and give the due 
charity, and that is the right religion. 

6 Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Book 
and the idolaters will be in the Fire of hell, abiding in it. They are 
the worst of creatures. 7 Those who believe and do good, they are 
the best of creatures. 8 Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of 
perpetuity in which rivers flow, abiding in them forever. Allah is 
well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him. That 
is for him who fears his Lord. 6 



a (1) Both the People of the Book, people to whom revelation had been 
granted at some previous time, and the idolaters of Arabia, among whom no prophet 
had ever appeared, were sunk so deep in immorality and sin that only a Divine 
Messenger could now free them from this bondage. The Jews and the Christians, 
one after another, had exerted themselves to their utmost to reform Arabia, but 
both had failed. In fact they were themselves demoralized like the Arabs. That by 
the clear evidence is meant the Prophet is made clear in the next verse, where this 
clear evidence is spoken of as being a Messenger from Allah. 

b (2) It should be noted that the Messenger is here described as reciting pure 
pages, thus showing clearly that the Quran existed in a written form at the time of 

788 



Ch. 98 • THE CLEAR EVIDENCE 789 

the revelation of this chapter. Their designation as pure is to show that the Quran 
brought them out of all impurities. 

c (3) Kitdb (occurring here in the plural, kutub) means a book or an ordi- 
nance. Whichever significance may be adopted, the meaning of the passage is that 
all those right directions necessary for the guidance of people, whether previously 
revealed or not, are to be met with in the Quran. The Quran thus claims to contain 
all the good points of other sacred books, and, in addition, to supply their 
deficiencies. 

d (4) The division mentioned here is the division into believers and dis- 
believers, some accepting the Messenger and others rejecting him. 

e (8) The companions of the Holy Prophet are here spoken of as having 
attained to the highest spiritual stage; compare 89:27-30, where the same words 
occur regarding spiritual perfection; see 89:30 footnote. This shows clearly that 
they were above all worldly motives, and not only joined Islam with the single 
object of pleasing God but also that their sincerity was above all reproach to the 
end, so that God was pleased with them and made them enter His Garden. 



Chapter 99 
Ai-zihai The Shaking 

The title of this chapter, Shaking, occurs in the first verse which hints at the 
severe shaking destined to bring about a transformation first in Arabia and 
later on in the whole world. It is one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 When the earth is shaken with her shaking, 2 and the earth 
brings forth her burdens, 3 and man says: What has happened to 
her? 4 On that day she will tell her news, 5 as if your Lord had 
revealed to her. a 6 On that day people will come forth, in diverse 
bodies, that they may be shown their works. 7 So whoever does an 
atom's weight of good will see it. 8 And whoever does an atom's 
weight of evil will see it. 



a (5) The first verse speaks of a violent shaking of the earth. That such a 
shaking would take place at the Resurrection cannot be denied. That it took place 
in the Holy Prophet's lifetime is a fact. This was the shaking which brought about 
that wonderful transformation in Arabia, and then in the whole world, which is 
spoken of in the last chapter. The second verse speaks of the earth as bringing 
forth her burdens. This has been taken as signifying both the bringing forth of the 
dead and the yielding of her hidden treasures. How the earth is bringing forth her 
hidden treasures of mineral wealth shows the wonderful knowledge of the future 
disclosed in the Quran. That these are the preliminaries of a great transformation 
is the one theme of these early revelations. The transformation brought about in 
the Prophet's lifetime was in fact the first stage in the greater transformation to be 
brought about in the whole world later on. 

Verses 3-5 indicate that, at the happenings referred to in the first two verses, 
man will wonder and cry out, what has happened to the earthl This shows that 
extraordinary happenings will be witnessed by man in this very life. The earth 
will tell her news, that is to say, great secrets hitherto unknown will be revealed. 
This is further stressed in v. 5, as if your Lord had revealed to her. In other words, 
as revelation discloses things which are unknown to man, so will great secrets 
hitherto unknown be revealed. Maybe there is a deeper reference here that in the 
wake of these extraordinary happenings will come a general spiritual awakening, 
as if God had revealed to the earth itself. 

b (8) People will be shown their works in the Resurrection by being made to 

790 



Ch. 99 • THE SHAKING 791 

taste of their fruits, but they can also see the good or evil of their works in this 
life. Good and evil, when practised on a large scale, bring their reward or requital 
in this life as well. Note that the words here are whoever does, and thus include 
both the Muslim and the non-Muslim. Even a non-Muslim who does an atom's 
weight of good will have its reward, and a Muslim who does an atom's weight of 
evil will be requited for it. 



Chapter 100 
Ai-'Adiyat The Assaulters 

This chapter receives its title from the prophetic mention of The Assaulters in 
the first verse, showing that some of the great disasters spoken of in the last 
chapter were to be brought about by means of war. This proved true not only 
in the time of the Holy Prophet but in modern times too the unprecedented 
wars may be a precursor of a great spiritual awakening, as they were in Arabia 
of his time. It is one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By those running and uttering cries! 2 And those producing 
fire, striking! 3 And those suddenly attacking at dawn! 4 Then 
thereby they raise dust, 5 then penetrate thereby gatherings — 
6 Surely man is ungrateful to his Lord." 7 And surely he is a witness 
of that. 8 And truly on account of the love of wealth he is miserly. 
'Does he not know (that) when those in the graves are raised, 
10 and what is in the hearts is made manifest, 11 surely their Lord 
this day is Aware of them? 



a (6) The majority of the commentators interpret verses 1-5 as applying to 
horses, in reference to the part they play in war. In this case it would be a pro- 
phetical description of the wars through which the opponents, who wanted to 
destroy Truth by the sword, were ultimately to be brought low. The words are so 
wide that they may also apply to modern means of warfare, particularly air attacks. 
Others understand that these are groups of spiritual wayfarers, who run fast in the 
way of God. Man's ungratefulness to his Lord and his excessive love of wealth is 
the real theme in all cases. He sees only the material side of life and does not pay 
heed to its spiritual values. The balance of life is thus upset. Disasters come and 
he is violently shaken so that his eyes may be opened to the real values of life. 

b (11) A day will come, we are told, when those in the graves — the dead — 
will be raised to life and what is hidden in the hearts — the deeds which man did, 
hiding them from the eyes of others — will be made manifest. God is Aware even 
now, but as in nature, the consequences are made manifest in due time. They may 
not be as clear here as they will be at the Resurrection, when the sight will be 
sharpened (50:22), but sometimes they are made manifest here, too. 



792 



Chapter 101 
Ai-Qari'ah The Calamity 

The repelling Calamity of this chapter, which gives it its title, is the same as 
the shaking of ch. 99. The date of revelation is also about the same. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 The calamity! 2 What is the calamity? 3 And what will make 
you know how terrible is the calamity?" 4 The day when people 
will be as scattered moths, 5 and the mountains will be as flakes of 
wool. 6 Then as for him whose good deeds are heavy, 7 he will 
live a pleasant life. 8 And as for him whose good deeds are light, 
'the abyss is a mother to him. c 10 And what will make you know 
what that is? n A burning Fire. 



a (3) Al-Qdri'ah signifies a very great calamity, and the word occurs 
without al ("the") in 13:31: "And as for those who disbelieve, disaster (qari'ah) 
will not cease to afflict them . . . until the promise of Allah come to pass". This 
shows that the word signifies one of those great calamities which befell the Quraish 
from time to time, and al is added to indicate that it is the promised calamity. In 
69:4, al-qari'ah signifies the great calamity which destroys a nation, i.e., their 
doom. Al-qari'ah is also a name of the day of Resurrection or of the great Calamity 
which will destroy this earth, after which comes the Resurrection. 

b (5) This description may also apply to the doom of the opponents of Truth. 

c (9) A place of habitation or abode is also called umm ("mother"), because 
it grants protection to a person, as does the mother to a babe. The abyss, or hell, is 
here called a mother to indicate that man's connection with hell is similar to that 
of a baby with its mother, namely, that his abode there fits him for progress in the 
spiritual world — he being brought up, as it were, in the bosom of hell, as a child 
is brought up in the bosom of its mother, and that his stay in hell is only for a 
time, as the child draws nourishment from his mother only for a time. 



793 



Chapter 102 
Ai-Takathur The Abundance of Wealth 

This chapter, which takes its title from the word Abundance in the first verse, 
stresses that vying with one another for wealth keeps people away from the 
real aim of life, and to make them realize this disasters are brought upon them 
to divest them of material comforts. Thus the subject-matter is connected with 
the previous chapters. It is one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Abundance diverts you, 2 until you come to the graves." 3 No 
indeed, you will soon know; 4 again, no indeed, you will soon 
know! 5 No indeed, if only you knew with a certain knowledge! ' 
6 You will certainly see hell; 7 then you will see it with certainty of 
sight; "then on that day you shall certainly be questioned about the 
blessings (that you wasted)/ 



a (2) Coming to the graves stands for death. The significance therefore is that 
vying with one another in increase of wealth diverts a man from the real object of 
life until he meets death. 

b (5) When a person dies, he then comes to know that the acquisition of 
wealth was in no way the real object of his life. But if he had proceeded on the 
basis of certain knowledge, he could have seen this in this very life. 

c (8) Verses 5-8 are considered as disclosing three degrees of certainty — 
certainty by inference, certainty by sight and certainty by realization. A person 
can by inference attain to a certainty of the existence of hell in this very life 
(verses 5 and 6); after his death he will see hell with his own eyes (v. 7); but a 
perfect manifestation of it will be realized by him on the day of Resurrection (v. 
8). Being questioned about the blessings implies tasting of the punishment for 
failing to make right use of what was granted to man. But the words may also be 
taken as applying to this life. By pondering on the very nature of evil a man can 
become certain of hell, this being the certainty by inference. Then he can acquire 
a certain knowledge by sight, by seeing the fate of others. Lastly, he is made to 
realize it by disasters being brought upon himself.

Chapter 103 
Ai-'Asr Time 

As compared to those spoken of in the last chapter, this chapter draws atten- 
tion to the testimony of Time in showing that those alone prosper who accept 
the Truth and exhort others to it. It is one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 By the time! — 2 Surely man is in loss, 3 except those who 
believe and do good, and exhort one another to Truth, and exhort 
one another to patience." 



a (3) The testimony of time is threefold: the flight of time affords the testi- 
mony that it is only those who do not waste the opportunity of doing good that 
reap the benefit; the light which shines along the path of bygone ages shows us 
that those who did good and enjoined good on others prospered, while the evil- 
doers were brought to naught; lastly, the time of the Holy Prophet afforded the 
clearest and most conclusive evidence that the believers and doers of good were 
successful, while their opponents sustained evident loss. 

'Asr signifies lime or succession of ages. Some, however, understand by al- 
'asr the time of the Holy Prophet. In fact, both significances hold good. While 
taking time in a general sense, it is true that every person who is not engaged in 
doing some permanent and lasting good is really losing every minute that passes 
away; the time of the Holy Prophet in which a great spiritual resurrection was 
brought about affords the clearest evidence that those who did not respond to the 
Prophet's call were the losers, while the faithful brought about a revolution in the 
whole world by exhorting goodness and patience on others. The enjoining of 
patience on each other follows the direction to enjoin Truth, because the preach- 
ing of Truth brings man face to face with difficulties, and unless he is patient and 
forbearing under hardships, he cannot adhere to the Truth. 



795 



Chapter 104 
Ai-Humazah The Slanderer 

As opposed to those spoken of in the last chapter, we have here a description 
of those whose aim is to amass wealth instead of doing good and who slander 
others instead of enjoining truth; hence the title The Slanderer from the first 
verse. It is one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Woe to every slanderer, defamer, a 2 who amasses wealth 
and counts it* — 3 he thinks that his wealth will make him abide 
forever. c 4 No indeed! He will certainly be hurled into the crushing 
disaster; 5 and what will make you realize what the crushing 
disaster is? 6 It is the Fire kindled by Allah, 7 which rises over the 
hearts. 6 "Surely it is closed in on them, 9 in extended columns/ 



a (1) The slanderers and defamers are condemned here generally, with parti- 
cular reference to the opponents who started their persecution of the Holy Prophet 
by bitterly slandering and defaming him, so that the pilgrims coming to Makkah 
from afar should not listen to his teachings. Just as goodness and patience are 
combined in the previous chapter as the two qualities which are the foundations 
on which human character should be built, the amassing of wealth and defaming 
are combined here as the two evils which lead ultimately to disaster. 

b (2) It is a succinct but exact picture of the material civilization of our day. 

c (3) By abiding is meant abiding in prosperity, or lasting forever. 

d (4) The name Al-hutamah ("crushing disaster") is applied to hell, because 
it crushes everything that is cast into it. It includes both hell and other disasters 
which, it is prophesied, would crush the wealthy defamers of the Truth, their 
punishment being called by this name because they wanted to crush the Truth. 

e (7) The Fire of hell is described as rising over the hearts, showing that it is 
within the heart of man that the origin of hell-fire lies. A man's hell is thus within 
his own heart in this life. 

/(9) It is inordinate desires extending beyond all limits that give rise to 
extended columns of fire. Spiritually they may be witnessed in this life, but they 
assume a palpable shape in the next. 



796 



Chapter 105 
Ai-Fii The Elephant 

This chapter is entitled The Elephant due to the presence of one or more 
elephants in the army of the King of Yaman which invaded Makkah, in the 
year of the birth of the Holy Prophet, with the object of destroying the Ka'bah. 
The army met with a crushing disaster, of the kind mentioned in the last 
chapter. It is one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Have you not seen how jour Lord dealt with the possessors 
of the elephant?" 2 Did He not cause their war to end in confusion? 
3 And send against them birds in flocks, 4 casting at them decreed 
stones, 5 so He rendered them like straw eaten up? 



a (1) The reference is to the memorable invasion of Makkah by Abrahah, the 
Christian governor in Yaman of the King of Abyssinia. Abrahah's object was to 
destroy the Ka'bah so as to divert Arab religious enthusiasm and Arab trade to 
Sana, where he had built a magnificent cathedral for the purpose. This army is 
known in Arabia as the ashab al-FTl, or the possessors of the Elephant, because of 
the presence in it of one or more elephants. The year in which the invasion took 
place is known as the year of the Elephant, being 570 C.E., the year also of the 
Holy Prophet's birth. Unable to defend the Holy House against the huge army, 
Abdul Muttalib, the Holy Prophet's grandfather, thus prayed aloud, leaning upon 
the door of the Ka'bah: "Defend, O Lord, Your own House! and let not the Cross 
to triumph over the Ka'bah". Then the whole population of Makkah took to the 
hills around the Holy City. Meanwhile a virulent form of small-pox, or some other 
pestilence, broke out in Abrahah's army with such severity that the army retreated 
in confusion and dismay, many of them, being unable to find their way back, 
perishing in the valleys, while a part was swept away by floods. 

There seems to be also an allusion to the circumstance that, in protecting the 
Ka'bah against an enemy, though idols were worshipped there at the time, 
Almighty God had shown a purpose in its preservation. The coincidence of this 
year with the year of the Holy Prophet's birth no doubt furnishes the key to that 
purpose, because the Arabs not only knew that the Sacred House had Abraham's 
blessing, but also that Abraham had prayed for the appearance of a prophet from 
among them who should purify the House. The mention of the incident thus con- 
veyed a warning to the Quraish that, if the Lord had destroyed an army on account 
of its intention to demolish His Sacred House, would He leave those alone who 
wanted to destroy His Prophet? 

797 



798 105. THE ELEPHANT • Ch. 105 

b (5) There is no authentic hadith as to how Abrahah's army was destroyed. 
There are reports that everyone at whom a stone was flung was affected with 
smallpox. Thus it was a virulent smallpox that broke out in the invading army 
while yet a little distance from Makkah, and the result was that Abrahah himself 
being affected with the pestilence, the whole army fled in a state of confusion, 
leaving the corpses of the dead for the birds to feast on. The words of v. 4 may 
mean the birds cast at them stones or flung them against stones, the reference in 
the latter case being to the birds tearing off flesh from their bodies. For birds as 
indicating the destruction of an enemy, see 16:79 footnote. 



Chapter 106 
Ai-Qumish The Quraish 

This chapter continues the subject-matter of the last, reminding the Quraish 
of the great benefits conferred on them because of their guardianship of the 
Ka'bah. The date of revelation is also the same. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 For the protection of the Quraish a — 2 their protection 
during their journey in the winter and the summer. 3 So let them 
serve the Lord of this House, 4 Who feeds them against hunger, 
and gives them security against fear. c 



a (1) The Quraish, the tribe to which the Prophet Muhammad belonged, were 
settled at Makkah and had charge of the Sacred House, to which pilgrims resorted 
from all parts of Arabia, and therefore, being guardians of the Holy House, they 
enjoyed special honour among the tribes of Arabia. Moreover Makkah had thus 
become the centre of Arabia, bringing prosperity to the Quraish. 

Verse 1 is connected with the last chapter, the significance being that the 
Divine protection of the Ka'bah and the destruction of its enemies was a special 
favour granted to the Quraish, for it led to their protection. Being guardians of the 
Ka'bah, they were respected when they set out on their journeys, while within the 
sacred territory they enjoyed an unparalleled security. 

b (2) The protection mentioned in the last note was of special use to them in 
their journeys northward to Syria and southward to Yaman, the former of which 
was undertaken in the summer and the latter in winter, to carry on their trade. 

c (4) Feeding against hunger and granting security against fear were the two 
special favours conferred on the Quraish through the sacredness of the Ka'bah, 
because the pilgrimage gave a special impetus to their trade and the necessaries of 
life were brought to their very doors, while they were totally secure from all fear 
of attack, to which the other Arab tribes were constantly exposed. 



799 



Chapter 107 
Ai-Ma'un Acts of Kindness 

This chapter gives expression to the prominence which Islam accords to 
helping the needy and the poor. Those who neglect this are described as 
denying religion. Prayer is a mere show if it does not generate feelings of 
love and sympathy for humanity. Hence its title Acts of Kindness occurring in 
the last verse. It is one of the very early revelations at Makkah. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Have you seen him who denies religion? 2 That is the one 
who is rough to the orphan, 3 and does not urge the feeding of the 

needy. a 

4 So woe to the praying ones, 5 who are unmindful of their 
prayer,* 6 who do (good) to be seen, 7 and refrain from acts of 
kindness! c 



a (3) The word din in v. 1 is generally taken here as meaning judgment, but 
its more well-known significance, religion, is preferable. Not taking care of orphans 
and helping the needy is really a denial of religion. Verses 4-7 make it clear that 
praying to God is useless, a mere show, unless one is kind to orphans and helps 
the needy. 

b (5) Being unmindful of prayer means not paying heed to the spirit of 
prayer, which is described in verses 2 and 3 as being the help of the orphan and 
the needy. 

c (7) Al-Ma 'un is explained by Bukhari as meaning every good or kind deed. 
And it is added that its highest form is the obligatory zakdt and the lowest is the 
lending of a thing or giving any useful thing to another (Bukhari, 65.107). It 
includes all acts of kindness done to others.

Chapter 108 
Ai-Kauthar The Abundance of Good 

The abundance of wealth spoken of in ch. 102 leads man astray from the real 
purpose of life. This chapter deals with the Abundance of Good and the means 
to attain it. Those means are: prayer to God, which fills one with the noblest 
aspirations, and sacrifice, which means devoting one's life to the service of 
humanity. It is one of the earliest revelations at Makkah. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Surely We have given you abundance of good. a 2 So pray to 
jour Lord and sacrifice. 3 Surely jour enemy is cut off (from 
good). c 



a (1) Al-kauthar means the abundance or the abundance of good. Here it 
means the abundance of good which God gave the Holy Prophet — he was 
promised the triumph of Islam over all religions, and granted help against his 
enemies and intercession for his community. In fact, he was granted so much of 
goodness of all kinds that it cannot be counted. From what is stated further on, it 
is clear that it is not the Holy Prophet alone who is promised this abundance of 
good but also every true follower of his who makes use of the means for the 
attainment of it, as described in the next verse. 

b (2) Two ways to attain the abundance of good promised in v. 1 are: 
praying to God, and nahr or sacrifice, which means the devoting of one's life to 
the good of humanity. Prayer is communion with God which raises in a person's 
heart the highest aspirations and makes him drink deep at the fountain of Divine 
morals. If there is no aspiration for good, it is simply impossible to do good; 
hence prayer is mentioned first. And when these noble aspirations arise, man is 
told, if need be, to lay down his very life for the service of humanity, not of one 
group or one nation or one community. Although nahr stands for sacrificing an 
animal, the sacrifice of an animal itself stands for sacrifice of self (see 22:34). 

c (3) The word abtar (cut off) conveys several significances. For instance, in 
want or poor, suffering loss, one from whom all good is cut off having no off- 
spring or progeny. All good is cut off from him because he walks contrary to the 
ways in which good can be attained. {Editor 's Note: This verse also refuted the 
allegation of the opponents that, as the Holy Prophet had no male offspring, his 
name and mission would come to an end after him. This verse contains a 
prophecy that it is his enemies who would be cut off and leave no successors to 
continue their name or work.) 

801 



Chapter 109 
Ai-Kafirun The Disbelievers 

The Disbelievers — hence the title — are told in this chapter that they shall 
be recompensed for their misdeeds, while the Holy Prophet and the faithful 
will reap the reward of their deeds. It belongs to the early period at Makkah. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Say: O disbelievers, 2 I do not serve what you serve, 3 nor do 
you serve Him Whom I serve, 4 nor shall I serve what you serve, 
5 nor do you serve Him Whom I serve. 6 For you is your recom- 
pense and for me my recompense. " 



a (6) Among the various significances of the word din is recompense or 
reward, and this is what is meant here, rather than religion. It is a prophecy that 
those who serve Allah will have a goodly reward from Him, while those who serve 
idols will not obtain any help from their false gods. The next chapter refers to the 
reward of the truthful, Divine help and victory, and people entering into Islam in 
companies, while the one following it shows that the recompense of the idol- 
worshippers is that their wealth and all their efforts will be entirely unavailing. 

Those who think that these words indicate that the Holy Prophet had 
despaired of the disbelievers are mistaken. Not for a single moment did he cease 
to invite the disbelievers to accept Islam and to forsake the worship of idols. 



802 



Chapter 110 
Ai-Nasr The Help 

This chapter speaks of the great Divine Help and victory, mentioned in the 
first verse, which the Holy Prophet received in the cause of Truth. It is repor- 
ted that this chapter was revealed during the last pilgrimage of the Holy 
Prophet and that he lived only eighty days after its revelation. Being revealed 
at Makkah during the Madinah period, it showed how those wonderful pro- 
phecies announced when the Holy Prophet was alone and helpless were now 
fulfilled by his visiting Makkah with the whole of Arabia accepting him. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 When Allah's help and victory comes," 2 andjou see people 
entering the religion of Allah in companies, 3 celebrate the praise 
of your Lord and ask His protection.* Surely He is ever Returning 
(to mercy). 



a (1) The great victory which had come was the triumph of the religion of 
Islam in the whole of Arabia. Deputation after deputation from all parts of Arabia 
came to Madinah and accepted Islam. History does not present another example 
of the wonderful transformation wrought by the Holy Prophet within the short 
space of twenty years. 

b (3) On witnessing the greatest triumph known to history, the Holy Prophet 
is told to celebrate the praise of his Lord, and to ask protection. For whom was 
protection to be asked? If it was for himself, it was a protection against elation at 
an unprecedented victory, because elation ill befitted a Teacher of righteousness. 
But more likely, he was required to ask protection for the masses which were now 
accepting Islam in companies. In fact he was required to ask Divine forgiveness 
or protection for his erstwhile oppressors, forgiveness for his deadly enemies, 
who were guilty of the gravest crimes. 



803 



Chapter 1 1 1 
Ai-Lahab The Flame 

This chapter is entitled Lahab in reference to the fact that it shows that the 
opponents of Truth led their lives in heart-burning, or it may refer to the name 
of the Holy Prophet's uncle, Abdul Uzza, who was bitterly opposed to him, 
Abu Lahab being a title given to him, which occurs in the first verse. The 
chapter thus deals with the end of opposition to Truth. It is a revelation of the 
early period at Makkah. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Abu Lahab's hands will perish and he will perish." 2 His 
wealth and what he earns will not avail him. 3 He will burn in fire 
giving rise to flames * — 4 and his wife — the bearer of slander; e 
5 upon her neck a halter of twisted rope! 



a (1) A man of a fiery temper may be called abii-lahab or father of flame. 
Abdul Uzza, a paternal uncle of the Holy Prophet, was known by this name, 
because of his ruddy complexion or his fiery temper. It is related that he followed 
the Prophet when he went out to preach, saying to people that the Prophet was a 
mad relative of his. His hands will perish means that all that he did in opposition 
to the Prophet will end in naught. It is said that he himself will perish. He is repor- 
ted to have died seven days after hearing of the defeat of the Quraish at Badr. 

b (3) He burned in fire in this very life because his life was a life of heart- 
burning, on account of his failure to check the advance of Truth. This fire gave 
rise to flames which burned others as well, including his own wife, who is spoken 
of in v. 4. There is also a reference to the palpable shape which this fire will take 
in the Hereafter. 

c (4) The flames that sprang from the fire in which Abu Lahab lived 
enveloped his own wife, so that she also took part in the opposition to the 
Prophet. Her part in opposition is here described as being hammalat al-hatab, 
generally translated as bearer of fuel. It is thought that this refers to the thorny 
bushes which she brought from the wood to spread in the Prophet's way. But the 
words also mean bearer of slander, as she used to spread false reports against the 
Prophet (Bukhari, 65.111: 3). 

d (5) She is said to have died by being strangled by the very rope in which 
she used to bring thorns. It is related that she was a wealthy woman who 
possessed a necklace of jewellery. Maybe the twisted rope is a reference to her 
jewellery, as a jewelled necklace is as worthless in the eye of God as a rope. 

804 



Chapter 112 
Ai-ikhias The Unity 

This is really the concluding chapter of the Holy Quran, the two following 
chapters only showing how the protection of the Lord is to be sought. It gives 
the sum and substance of the teachings of the Quran, which is the declaration 
of the Unity of God. Ikhlas means purification from dross and this chapter is 
so-called because it purifies the Unity of God of all dross of polytheism. It is 
one of the earliest revelations. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Say: He, Allah, is One. 2 Allah is He on Whom all depend. 
3 He has no offspring, nor is He born (of anyone); 4 and none is like 
Him. fl 



a (4) This, a very early revelation, points out the fundamental errors of many 
religions, including Christianity, in its four short sentences. The first verse pro- 
claims the absolute Unity of the Divine Being, and deals a death-blow to all forms 
of polytheism, including the doctrine of the Trinity. 

In v. 2 Allah is said to be Samad, which the Holy Prophet is reported to have 
explained as meaning the Lord to Whom recourse is had in every need, so that all 
have need of Him and He has need of none. This statement negatives the doctrine 
according to which soul and matter are co-eternal with God and God stands in 
need of them to bring about creation. The doctrine prevails in India, and could not 
have been known to the Holy Prophet. 

V. 3 points out the error of those religions which describe God as being 
father or son, such as the Christian religion. 

V. 4 negatives such doctrines as the doctrine of incarnation, according to 
which a mere human being is likened to God. 

Thus four kinds of corruption of the belief in the oneness of God are rejected 
here: a belief in the plurality of gods (v. 1), a belief that other things possess the 
perfect attributes of the Divine Being (v. 2), a belief that God is either a father or 
a son (v. 3), and a belief that others can do that which is ascribable only to God 
(v. 4). 



805 



Chapter 113 
Ai-Faiaq The Dawn 

This chapter and the following one teach how to seek refuge in God and ask 
for His protection. Both these chapters were revealed most probably in the 
early period at Makkah. It is called The Dawn from the word occurring in the 
first verse, showing that Truth would ultimately dispel all darkness. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the dawn, a 2 from the evil 
of what He has created,* 3 and from the evil of intense darkness, c 
when it comes, 4 and from the evil of those who cast (evil sugges- 
tions) in firm resolutions/ 5 and from the evil of the envier when 
he envies/ 



a (1) The reference in the Lord of the dawn is to the gradual manifestation of 
the Truth and its ultimate triumph. 

b (2) Editor 's Note: Anything which God has created can cause harm if it is 
used in an incorrect way, without the light of knowledge. 

c (3) This signifies darkness in which there is no ray of light, and stands for 
the dark difficulties with which an affair is sometimes attended — difficulties 
through which a person is unable to see his way. Man is, therefore, here taught to 
pray that his affairs may not be enveloped in utter darkness. 

d (4) These words indicate those who put evil suggestions into the resolution 
of people or into the management of their affairs. This verse deals with the second 
difficulty in the management of an affair. The first difficulty is its being enveloped 
in utter gloom (v. 3); the second is that darkness is dispelled, but the resolution to 
accomplish the affair is yet weak. (Editor 's Note: The view that this verse refers 
to witches, who had once cast a spell on the Holy Prophet by "blowing on knots", 
is entirely baseless and contrary to the teachings of the Quran.) 

e (5) This is the third difficulty. Success is now in sight, but there are those 
who envy that success. Therefore, Divine protection has still to be sought when a 
person is successful in accomplishing an affair. 

Note that the Prophet, who was charged with the heavy task of establishing 
truth in the world and making it triumphant over falsehood, had to face all these 
difficulties, and his faithful followers, whose goal of life is the same as that of the 
Prophet, stand most in need of resorting to this prayer with which the Quran 
draws to a close. 



806 



Chapter 114 
ai-nss Mankind 

See the introductory note on the last chapter. The name of this chapter is 
taken from the word occurring in it describing God as the Lord, King and 
God of mankind, meaning that He is their Nourisher to perfection, Controller 
of their affairs and Controller of their hearts. 



In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind, 2 the King of 
mankind, 3 the God of mankind, 4 from the evil of the whisperings 
of the sneaking (devil), 5 who whispers into the hearts of people, 
6 (and is) from among the jinn and mankind." 



a (6) These verses are a complement to the previous chapter. Three kinds of 
mischief are pointed out there which may be done to the cause of Truth. Here a 
fourth, but the gravest mischief of all, is pointed out, that of the sneaking devil, 
who comes stealthily and casts evil suggestions into the hearts of people. The 
whispering of the evil one is the greatest mischief because its source is in the 
hearts of people (v. 5). Al-khannas (v. 4) is the devil because he retires or shrinks 
or hides himself. 

Man is here taught to seek refuge in God Who is, in the first place, the Rabb 
of mankind, i.e., its Nourisher by degrees to Perfection; secondly, He is the Malik 
or King of mankind, i.e., holds control over them, so far as the physical laws of 
nature are concerned; thirdly, He is the Ilah of mankind, Who alone deserves to 
be worshipped and before Whom the whole of mankind must ultimately bow. In 
other words, the protection of God is sought because He is the Nourisher Who 
brings to perfection, and He holds control over Matter as well as Mind. The Divine 
purpose is thus again disclosed at the end, as it is disclosed in the very beginning 
(1:1) of the Holy Quran. It is to bring mankind to perfection. Nothing in this 
world can frustrate this purpose, as God holds control over matter as well as mind.

Index 



Explanation: In references to verses, the number before a colon is the chapter 
number and the number following the colon is the verse number in that 
chapter. A footnote to a verse is referred to by placing n after the verse 
number; thus 2:5 1/? refers to the footnote under 2:51. If a verse has more than 
one footnote, a figure is added after n, for example, n-\ or n-2, to identify the 
specific footnote. A slash before n (as in 2:260/rc) indicates that both the 
verse (2:260) and the footnote (2:260«) should be consulted. A chapter 
number and colon may be followed by references to several verses and foot- 
notes in that chapter; for example, 20:85«, 90«, 95 refers to footnotes and 
verses in chapter 20. The introductory note to a chapter is indicated by a 
reference such as "ch. 19 intro." To refer to a page number, p. is inserted 
before the number, as in: p. 1-21. The reader's attention is drawn to the 
following headings of this Index in which reference is made to certain impor- 
tant subjects as dealt with in the Holy Quran: Allah, Civic Life, Human Soul, 
Intellectual Development, Knowledge, Man, Morals, Muhammad, Muslims, 
Nature, Prayer, Quran, Revelation, Science, State Polity and Women.

Maulana Muhammad Ali (d. 1951, Pakistan) is the world-famous 
author of several highly-acclaimed books on Islam, including his 
English translation of the Holy Quran with detailed commentary. 

Born in 1874 in the Punjab (India), Maulana Muhammad Ali had 
a distinguished educational record, obtaining excellent degrees in 
English and Law by the year 1899. Through his interest in religion, 
he joined the Ahmadiyya Movement in 1897. As he was about to 
embark on a lucrative career in law, he was called upon by the 
Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad 
(d. 1908), to devote his life for the service of Islam. He forthwith 
went to join the Founder in Qadian and began his literary work under 
the Founder's guidance. He was appointed the first editor of the 
Review of Religions, an English monthly, which was started by the 
Founder to present the true picture of Islam to the English-reading 
public all over the world. During this period, in 1 909, he began work 
on his translation of the Quran, which was published in 1917. 

In 1914, when an internal danger arose within the Ahmadiyya 
Movement attempting to alter its true character, Maulana Muhammad 
Ali left Qadian and, along with other leading figures in the 
Movement, founded the Ahmadiyya Anjuman Isha 'at Islam in 
Lahore, a Muslim missionary and literary organisation, to preserve 
the real mission, beliefs and ideals of the Founder of the Movement. 

From then till his death in 1951, Maulana Muhammad Ali led 
this Association, directed its missionary activities, and produced a 
vast amount of invaluable, scholarly literature on Islam. His books 
have influenced millions of people all over the world towards a 
favourable view of Islam, and have earned the highest tributes. (See a 
list of his major books given opposite the title page of this book.) His 
last work was a thorough revision of his translation and commentary 
of the Quran in the late 1940s, the revised edition being first 
published in 1951.
